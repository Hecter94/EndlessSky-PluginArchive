>The most extensive all-content plugin to date. It includes many opportunities to test balance or ship builds against AI driven ships or fleets, all vanilla content and the content of many plugins available to use to put together different ship builds. Many more tools are included into Omnis too!

<blockquote>### Welcome to Omnis!
Omnis has risen to be the #1 all-content plugin in the community, though competition is still encouraged as only from different perspectives can the best iteration of this niche be reached. Omnis was released after [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge) but before [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo), and good faith was practiced by all competing authors.

In order of release, known competitors have been:
- [All Content Plugin](https://github.com/endless-sky/all-content-plugin)
- [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge)
- [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo)
- [Ruin the Fun](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun)

### What to expect
There is no need to worry about breaking existing saves when installing, you will be presented with a warning that lets you choose what level of involvement you want that save to have with Omnis. To avoid any interaction, there's an option to abort which will kill the player and disallow saving the interaction.

So how do you use this plugin? Well there are two very simple methods of [accessing Omnis](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/-Omnis/wiki/Access), there is a wormhole in Rutilicus to travel there, and there is a custom start that can be chosen when making a new pilot.

> [!WARNING]
> The Omnis custom start will begin your pilot with an impossibly high credit value and brand your save with the Omnis start.

>This mod starts you on Greenrock with a trillion (10^12) credits and access to almost every ship and outfit in the game.

<blockquote># All-Content Plugin
This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.

# Contributing
This plugin is meant to mirror the most recent official release of [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), rather than its most recent "continuous build," and as such should be usuable to those who use Steam or PPAs as the source of their game version. As such, PRs are welcome following new additions during an ES release cycle, but depending on the scope of the contribution, may not be merged promptly.

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent
<br>
<br>
Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>
<br>
Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/40/27 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>
You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships
<br>
<br>
Makes person ships captureable.<br> 
<br>
<br>
Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones(with a space more in its names, due to limitations of changing parts of originals) which are captureable. Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000.<br>
So attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average within 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
Tested this plugin with 10x KIV349 and 10x Model512, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Except for "Zitchas" which needed less dmg weapons and max flamethrowers to prevent its cloaking. Also boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and i tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too. Another problem is "Tranquility" which has no weapons and therefore avoids fight. Tested different personality settings and best choice was to let it stay in system after spawn(yellow dot on radar).<br>

>Make Kestrel a much better ship, and increased requirements.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>This is a small rework of the Kestrel ship. The intent is to put it on par with several higher tiered alien outfits, most notablely Wanderer (2) outfits, as opposed to standard Human (1-1.5) Outfits. 
This does not make much sense according to the lore, but I personally prefer the asthetic of the Kestrel compared to many of the Wanderer ships. As such, the changes are as follows:

-The requirements for the Kestrel sub-quest have been changed:
	-The combat rating was increased from 8,000 (Combat rank 9: "Force to be reckoned with") --> 22,000 (Combat rank "Fearsome Scrapper). Intended to limit obtaining the newly buffed ship until the player is on a similar power level.
	-Increased the standard cost of the ship from 14700000 --> 67500000, as another change intended to limit how early a player could obtain the ship.
	-Buffed "Unknown ship type" by roughly half of the changes to the base Kestrel (I.E, instead of 49,700 shields, the test ship will have about 23,000), increasing the difficulty of the inital test fight while not requiring too much power to win.

-Base model "Kestrel" (Unlisted stats were not changed)
	-Shields 19,400 --> 49,700
	-Hull 7,200 --> 30,400
	-Fuel Capacity 500 --> 700
	-Outfit space 810 --> 870
	-Weapon capacity 390 --> 410
	-Engine Capacity 210 --> 230
	-Bunks 128 --> 150

-Engine Kestrel:
	-Drag -1.0 --> -2.0
	-Fuel Capacity 100 --> 300
	
-Shield Kestrel:
	-Shields 3,000 --> 28,000
	-Hull 1,500 --> 4,900

-Weapon Kestrel:
	-Weapon Capacity 40 --> 150
  
  I made these edits mostly for personal useage, and as such these are the numbers I found acceptable for my late game ship. If you feel otherwise, feel free to make edits as you please.

<blockquote>Ruin The Fun (es-ruin-the-fun)
===

Cheat plugin for [endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), to ruin your fun, or to assist you in making or testing another plugin.

Access all ships and outfits, change your captain's name, choose the color swizzle of your ships, edit your relation with other governments, set your combat rank, hire a powerful escort, gift yourself pre-outfitted ships, give yourself money, and much more.



## Downloads

- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: Sources](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/archive/refs/heads/main.zip):
  This is the latest commit to the plugin. It may or may not be stable, and it may also not work at all or break your save.
  Includes partial **built-in plugin support**.
- [🎁 Ruin-The-Fun: Tested Release](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/latest) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/latest/download/-es-ruin-the-fun.zip):
  This is a tested and recommended version. But perhaps not the latest.
  Includes partial **built-in plugin support**.
- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: (Automatic Updates)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/):
  This version is automatically generated on every new game version (either pre-release or release).
  It should feature the latest game content.
  However, if the data file syntax was changed by the new version, this might cause warnings or errors.
  No built-in plugin support.
- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: (Endless Sky continuous)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/es-continuous) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/download/es-continuous/-es-ruin-the-fun-for-es-continuous.zip):
  This version is periodically generated to match continuous builds of Endless Sky. This is also the latest untested RTF version.
  If you do not use continuous Endless Sky builds, do not use this version, as it will contain things that are not yet in you game (that will be a problem).
  No built-in plugin support.



## Install

Install this plugin by dropping it into the game's `plugins` folder.
If the plugin is in a `.zip` / archive file, extract it.

The game's `plugins` folder should be located at one of those locations:
- On Windows:
  - `plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)`
  - or `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\`
- On Linux:
  - `/usr/share/games/endless-sky/plugins/`
  - or `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`
- On Mac:
  - `Contents/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)`
  - or `~/Library/Application Support/endless-sky/plugins`

If the `plugins` folder does not exist, you can create it.

If you did it right, there should be a file `plugins/-es-ruin-the-fun/about.txt` or `plugins/-Ruin The Fun/about.txt`.

> This plugin should not conflict with any other, because it uses separate systems and prefixes objects it defines.



## Startup

⚠️ **Be advised against using this plugin with your favorite pilot's save**, since it will make your hours of labor nonsensical.
If you want to use this plugin for an existing save anyway, then **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PILOT** (for instance with the `Add snapshot` button).

![add snapshot button](./images/screenshot/add-snapshot.png)

If your intent is rather to use this plugin with a new pilot, you may use one of the starts provided by this plugin to do so:

![new pilot starts menu](./images/screenshot/rtf-starts.png)
You will spawn in an RTF system, from which cheat features are available.

Cheat features are available from, and only from, the RTF systems. One of them has an hyperlink to `Rutilicus` (the default start system), so that you can reach it with an Hyperdrive:

![map screenshot](./images/screenshot/rtf0-on-map.png)

There is other RTF systems everywhere on the map, so you do not have to cross it whole.

![map screenshot](./images/screenshot/rtf-systems-on-map.png)



## Spaceport

![Spaceport](./images/screenshot/spaceport-button.png)

Click the `Spaceport` button to access a number of quick actions.
More actions are available from the `Job Board`.



## Job Board

![Job Board](./images/screenshot/job-board-button.png)

The `Job Board` contains most of this plugin's features.

The following jobs can be used after every landing on an RTF planet:
- `[basic] All Useful Things`: Get money, reveal the map, and earn combat rank 14.
- `[basic] Color Swizzle`: Change the color of your ships.
- `[basic] Combat Rank`: Set your combat rank. Optionally spawn a target in space, to get xp from.
- `[basic] Conditions`: Set your karma and other conditions.
- `[basic] Events`: Let you edit a few vanilla conditions.
- `[basic] Free Money`: Obtain 1B credits.
- `[basic] Government Reputations`: Change your reputation with other governments.
- `[basic] Pilot Name`: Change your captain's name.
- `[basic] Reveal Map`: Reveal the whole system map (upon take of).
- `[basic] Reveal Planet Infos`: Reveal all vanilla planets information (upon take of, does not reveal systems).
- `[escort] * Barges` (3 variants): Get escorted by dreadful Star Barges.
- `[escort] Escort Fleets`: Select fleets to spawn as NPC escorts.
- `[escort] Escort Ships`: Select ships to spawn as NPC escorts.
- `[escort] Tek Far 109`: Get escorted by a customized drone transporter.
- `[fight] Combat Drones`: Summon an amount of hostile Combat Drones.
- `[fight] Fight Fleet`: Pick hostile fleets to spawn.
- `[fight] Fight Ships`: Pick hostile ships to spawn.
- `[fight] Kestrels`: Summon a combination of hostile Kestrels.
- `[fight] Tek Far 109`: Summon an hostile customized drone transporter.
- `[special] RTF Advanced Start`: Replays the advanced start conversation.

The following jobs are toggles, their effect is reverted when you abort them:
- `[toggle fleet] Heliarchs vs Quargs`: Adds Heliarch and Quarg fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle fleet] Meretis vs Sestors`: Adds Mereti and Sestor fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle fleet] Scin vs Vis`: Adds Scin and Vi fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle] Automatic Galaxy Map`: Automatically reveal all connected systems upon entering one.
- `[toggle] Hide RTF Systems`: Hide the RTF systems, so that they do not interfere.
- `[toggle] Super Reach`: While in an RTF system, you can jump to any system on the map, even without a God Drive. By default, RTF systems have a lower jump range, to lower their impact on surrounding content.
- `[toggle] Variants`: Enable ship variants in the RTF shipyards.



## Shipyard

![Shipyard](./images/screenshot/shipyard-button.png)

From the RFT shipyards, all ships in the game are available to you.



## Outfitter

![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/outfitter-button.png)

From the RFT outfitters, all outfits in the game are available to you.

RTF also adds a few outfits, all listed under the `Special` category:
- `God Drive`: Jump drive, with no range limit, that does not consume fuel.
- `God Mode`: Makes you immortal.
- `God Turret`: Turret that one-shot most ships.
- `100000 Outfit Space`: Gives you more than enough outfit space.
- `100000 Cargo Space`: Gives you so much cargo space that this will trigger pirate raids.
- (property name): Change individual stats of a ship. They look like this:
![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/wheel-examples.png)



## Updating Content

You can **update the plugin's vanilla content** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make update

You may have to set the path to the Endless Sky `data` folder as instructed.

You can **include content from other plugins** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make plugin-update

This will only work if all plugins, including RTF, are in the same `plugins` folder.



## Assets (placeholders)

You can use those assets as placeholders:
 - [Outfits](./images/outfit/rtf/)
 - [Sounds](./sounds/)

Info about individual assets are available from [./copyright](./copyright).



## Moving an RTF system

You can use a mission and an event like this to move a RTF system to your plugin's galaxy:
```
mission "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
    landing
    on offer
        event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
        fail
event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
	system "RTF10"
		pos -2700 -1500
```

<blockquote># World-Forge Plugin for [Endless-Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/)
World-Forge is a plugin for content creators and developers of endless-sky, adding a few systems, which have all outfits and ships available to buy. 

Have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Wrzlprnft/world-forge/wiki) for more information and to see what this plugin is capable of.

It is not yet finished, but working.
It does support older pilots without doing harm to them, but also has a altered start for new pilots.

## I do not recommend this for playing in super sandbox mode, because the game might actually get boring using all the superweapons, but if you're into that, go ahead.

Thx Local God, LeafyGrove, Storm Crow for helping in creating and updating.
Thx to Earl Grey, from whom i basically copied and edited the swizzle change system.
Special Thanks goes to Derpy Horse, as well as the official title "Maintainer of World Forge". 
No, for real, Derpy is the reason this still exists.

<blockquote># ZESglobal
Zitchas's Endless Sky Global mod. This is a collection of files intended to change the general feel of the game. These files and changes are intended to be complimentary and used together, but you are welcome to pick and choose which changes you want.

ZOutfitSpace
The first mod in this set is ZOutfitSpace. This file expands the outfit space of all ships by 5%. Ships for whom 5% would be less than 5 extra space instead are straight up given 5 extra space. One of the central aspects of Endless Sky is outfitting, and while the challenge of making effective and useful ships in limited space is fun; On the flip side, I dislike having to *always* be focused on min-maxing the combat capabilities of my ship. I *enjoy* putting "non-combat" outfits on my ships; things like research laboratories, or salvage scanners. Even if I get almost no combat advantage from it, I enjoy being able to see the tactical scanner info on my GUI. 
This file does not change the Bactrian, Puffin, or Indigenous ships.

<blockquote># BetterVanillaHai for Endless Sky

In short this plugin assumes news of the Hai spreads rapidly. Therefore in the late game a small percentage of humans start using their ships in ambient fleets. It therefore adds Hai vessels and many variants (like full Proton SB or Plasma/QuadBlaster Solifuge + many more) as rare additions to almost all human fleets in the late-game (more details below). This makes ambient pirate combat much more spicy and varied, with the tide of pirate battle being turned when a Hai ship from either side jumps in.

Ambient spawn rate of Hai ships should be around or below 10%. The plugin attempts to maintain NPC combat balance by adding strength evenly to opposing fleets (pirate/merchant etc), and maintain vanilla feeling fleet compositions.

It activates these changes after player completes both the missions related to the Solifuge and Pond Strider, and has also completed the main plot.

The general idea behind this change is that news of advanced squirrel aliens in close proximity to humanity would plausibly spread very rapidly and that the more prosperous/badass merchants and pirates will be therefore occasionally seen using their ships in human space.

Now if merchants/pirates start using Hai ships, then by golly gosh the military can't allow themselves to be outgunned and is forced to get on board the acorn train too. Therefore this plugin gives the Republic and FW custom variants of the SB as well as the standard Hai weapon setups. Deep/Syndicate use the Strider in the same way. Militia get nothing because they are poor.

Merchants/navy don't use the Solifuge, but pirates do because... somehow. To be honest I couldn't come up with any plausible process for pirates to get their hands on Solifuges - maybe they could buy from the De-fettered though pirates getting through Hai space seems unlikely - but whatever. It's a cool Hai ship, I didn't want to leave it out, so some Solifuge variants pop up in pirate fleets just because. Also the Proton Solifuge (used by Core pirates) is freaking badass.

This plugin doesn't add Hai outfitted human ships in a similar fashion (BetterVanillaPirates does).


Enjoy!

es-bounty-hunters is a plugin for Endless Sky that adds a new storyline in which the player can become a Bounty Hunter. I won't spoil it for you here...

## Installation
Download the code as a .zip and extract it to your plugins file. On Linux, it's `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins`, and I don't use Window or Mac, so you'll have to figure it out yourself.

## Acknowledgements
Thank you to everyone on the ES Discord for helping me, but special thanks to EjoThims for reviewing the first chapter of the story, Arachi for pointing out my dumb mistakes, and Warlord Mike for coming up with the names for Arthur Stalgren and Admiral Lowell. Thanks, guys!

<blockquote># Endless Sky Conscience Plugin

This plugin is meant to allow you to complete Endless Sky story lines without doing things you have an ethical problem with. For now, it just makes it so you don't need to drop a bomb on Zenith and kill civilians.

If you'd rather grind then use a plugin, you can cap a bunch of Korath ships in Kor Ak'Mari and destroy the Sestor fleet that way.

If you take the Quarg ships anywhere other than the assigned planets and systems, they may or may not disappear.

## Installing

1. Download the plugin here: [https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases](https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases)

2. Put the zip file in your plugins folder:

Windows: `%APPDATA%\endless-sky\plugins/`

Mac: `~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins/`

Linux: `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

3. Decompress/"Unzip" the zip file.
4. Start Endless Sky. You should be able to see "A Coalition at War" under Preferences > Plugins.
5. If you have problems, open an issue.

# Using the Plugin

Install the plugin before you get to Hevru Hai. If you're already past that mission, try landing on Hevru Hai anyway. It might still work.

Park any escort ships you don't want to lose in Hai space. Make sure you have a cloaking device on your flagship.

It's best if your flagship is better than what humans have (a Wanderer warship would do nicely), but as long as your shields can last till you run away, you'll be ok.

Destroy or capture the Sestor drones above Farpoint before you land.

After talking to Danforth, cloak and hide. Run away. If you're daring, come back and distract single Sestor ships on the edges. Cloak fast when needed.

Make sure to destroy or capture every last drone, until you get a message that starts with `Against all odds...`

## Alnilam Mission

You'll get two Quarg ships to help you with this one too. Make sure to destroy or capture every Korath drone in the system. The game is more picky about this one, so if you go to Fairpoint and don't get the next mission, go back and destroy any disabled drones.

Then return to Fairpoint. You'll then be sent to Zenith. When you get to Zenith, land immediately. Don't let the cruisers get destroyed before you land on the planet.

That's it! You've successfully avoided committing mass murder!

<blockquote># Costly Drives
I've always found it odd that hyperdrives, despite the supposed mystery of their workings, is sold super cheaply, especially when compared to a bunch of power outfits (which have basis in real life). This plugin makes drives much more expensive, while making them unplunderable to prevent easy(er) boarding. Additionally, drive sales are much more restricted.

Known Problems:
- Broken JDs don't have increased value/unplunderable: The main use of Broken JDs is for the Remnant Broken JD mission, and I didn't want to force players to have a boarding ship to do those missions.
- Missions don't give a corresponding amount of increased money. Because of the inability to modify existing missions using plugins, this is unfixable at the moment.

Get rewarded for playing in Endless Sky

## How it works

You will get a special mission when you go and land on New Wales,

Basically go to Earth from there and then you should enjoy a somewhat balanced salary of credits per day.

> I didn't want to make it too much or then the game get's rather boring. (Also didn't want to make it too little else you really don't gain anything)

## Don't forget I have another mod

Tired of just getting credits? Want something more?

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>Attempts to adjust mass values for ships in the game Endless Sky. Where mass governs acceleration and turning and drag limits max velocity, larger ships should have more mass so they accelerate slower than small ships... 

Work in progress...

Summary of changes from 9.13:

Adjusts mass stat of ships based on the stats of the ship. I.E. Shield hitpoints,
hull hp, outfit space, etc.

Most ships gain mass small ships gain a little, large ships gain a lot. See spreadsheets/ShipMassStats
for details.

Large ships are much slower to turn and accelerate, making them feel like large ships.

Shield recharge and hull repair systems have been given a 90% boost to capablilty to help the slower
ships survive combat longer.

Added an efficiency penalty to energy consumption. spreadsheets/shieldSystems for details.
	
For example:

Human rechargers are 85% efficient, resulting in an 18.4% increase in power consumption over 
shield recharge. Vanilla is 1 point of energy gets you 1 point of shields.

Ship engines are reworked to increase the smaller engines while keeping the larger ones close to the same.

Smaller ships are now faster compared to the max speeds of the largest ships. spreadsheets/Engines.

Human/Hai engines' prices have been increased: Ion +20%, Plasma +30%, Atomic +80%. The lore speaks of
how expenisive atomic engines are, but they don't feel like it... Hopefully Ion and plasma engine fits
are more attractive to the early game.

<h1><p align=center>Endless Sky Plugin:<br />Spacefarer</p></h1>

This is a plugin for the free open source game: [Endless Sky][ES].  The theme
song for this plugin is [The Wanderer][the-wanderer].

# Gameplay Mechanics Changes

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin
aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few
constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- One Jump Drive
- Outfits cannot be looted
- Ships cannot be captured

# Extras provided by plugin

- Navy licenses are granted at the end of Free Worlds campaign.  So that Navy
  ships are purchasable by the player.
- Large systems core and double/triple plasma core are available after Remnant
  Cognizance missions.  They are for sale to provide additional build
  flexibility.

# Known issues

- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
- If a player sells their Jump Drive they cannot get it back.  This is
  intentional.
- A player can obtain up to 3 Jump Drives simultaneously.  However, additional
  Jump Drives will be consumed to proceed with story content.  At the end, the
  player would be left with one Jump Drive.

# Development status: Beta

All critical story elements are available.  Necessary outfits are available or
plunderable when a mission calls for it.

- [x] Sheragi (JD granted for retrieving Emerald Sword)
  - [ ] Remove 2nd Jump drive granted during Sheragi campaign.
- [x] Wanderer (JD granted to give to Unfettered)
- [x] Syndicate Checkmate (JD granted to leave Pug space)
- [ ] Clean up old lootable outfits and convert them to missions.
  - [x] Free Worlds Surveillance Pod mission
  - [ ] Wanderer Control Transceiver and Reasoning Node mission
  - [ ] Free Worlds Electron Beam mission

>Turns endless sky into a "character-driven" RPG, featuring a special ship known as the Apoxys. Take the helm of the black and red beauty and play your way through the whole game in just one ship; a ship that just so happens to grow along with you!

<blockquote># TaleOfApoxys
Turn endless sky into an RPG with a ship that grows with you, crafting, and plenty of side-goodies to play with

Currently the mod is separated into two branches, pending a bugfix. The main branch is playable with no issues on continuous. The carrier pre-alpha, on the other hand, requires a bugfix PR (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7030) to be fully enjoyed, and is also unfinished.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy!

>Made for the mobile version and adds several new buttons to the lower right corner. See the readme for details.
>(inspired by theweirednut)

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### additional.command.buttons <br>
<br>
Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 
<ul>
<li>full stop</li>
<li>board ship</li>
<li>land on planet</li>
<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>
<li>fleet: hold position</li>
<li>fleet: gather around me</li>
<li>fleet: attack my target</li>
<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>
<li>view player info</li>
<li>fast forward</li>
</ul>
and
<ul>
<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>
<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>
</ul>
<br>
(inspired by theweirednut) <br>
<br>
<img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/master/myplugins/additional.command.buttons/screenshot.jpg' width='400'>
<br>
Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>
<br>
Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>
- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>
- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>
<br>
This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>
<br>
<br>
Changelog:<br>
<br>
2023-10-17<br>
added plugin.txt<br>
<br>
2023-08-24<br>
fixed non-fireing attack button<br>
<br>
2023-08-05<br>
moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place<br>
<br>
2023-08-02<br>
added new icon and reworked readme<br>
<br>
2023-07-26<br>
added 3 more buttons to a total of 10<br>
added descriptions inside script to exchange buttons functions<br>
<br>
2023-07-06<br>
changed 'fire afterburner' to new 'fleet: harvest flotsam', because afterburner can easily toggled by double tapping<br>

In vanilla, the solar system has:

>This plugin adds shipping containers and container ships to the game. 
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Endless Cargo

## What is it?

It's a plugin/mod for [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io) which attempts to add shipping containers and container ships to the game.

## How do I install it?

[Download the ZIP file](https://bitbucket.org/YellowApple/endless-cargo/downloads/) and extract it into your plugins folder.  Alternately, you can just `git clone` directly into the plugins folder (e.g. `git clone https://bitbucket.org/YellowApple/endless-cargo.git ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/endless-cargo`).

## How does it work?

The current plan is to implement a shipping container as a sort of unarmed, ~~unpropelled~~ (HAHA, turns out at least *some* propulsion is needed for them to redock if you release them) drone, and in turn to implement a container ship as a sort of drone carrier.  This means that drones and shipping containers are interchangeable.

At this time, one type of container (a generic "Cargo Container") and two container ships (the Star Barge and Freighter without the welded-in containers and with drone bays for one's own containers) are implemented.  There's also a test mission out of Greenrock to haul an empty container to a nearby factory world (like New Britain or Luna), which I plan to flesh out and turn into more missions for more planets (including with specialized container types).  Most (if not all) factory worlds in human space sell containers, and the Container Barge and Container Freighter are available from any "Syndicate Basics" shipyard (and the former from any "Basic Ships" shipyard, so you can grab a Container Barge as your first ship right out of New Boston).

In the distant future, I might opt to attempt to implement containers as their own ship class, or perhaps as something that's not necessarily a "ship" per se.  This would require submitting this as a part of the vanilla game, though; while I think this idea is pretty cool, I'm also fully aware that's it's a *very* niche mod that probably doesn't belong in the core game, in which case - unless the core game opens up the ability to easily define new ship classes - the drone-container approach is probably the best I can do for the time being.

## What kinds of shipping containers will be implemented?

The average container (that is, the kind you'd actually want to buy at a shipyard) would have very little besides a few tons of cargo space and perhaps a smidge of outfit space.  A container ship would in turn have very little cargo or passenger space on its own, but could instead fill itself with shipping containers.

Once the basic shipping mechanics are implemented (namely, a basic container and a basic container ship), I'll likely delve into some missions involving specialized container types.  Some examples:

- Transport 5 containers carrying helicopters to Vail
- Haul 35 families and their prefabricated homes to a trailer park on New Boston
- Deliver 25 mining excavators and 5 portable field offices to a mining operation on Bounty
- etc.

Whether or not these specialized containers are something which you could buy in a shipyard is TBD.  There'd probably be no point to it, though I'm not one to stop someone from wasting money (especially if it's for roleplaying purposes or perhaps to resell somewhere else).

## Ain't this the same thing the Boxwing already does?

Kinda.  Containers are basically the drone version of the Boxwing.  Notable differences:

* Containers are drones, and thus don't require crew
* Containers are drones, and thus take up drone slots instead of fighter slots
* Containers are meant to make Boxwings look like Flivvers in comparison
* Containers have a fraction of the Boxwing's cargo space (currently 25%; I might bump that to 50% once I'm ready to actually dive into balancing)

Additionally, this plugin will feature actual missions/jobs/etc. revolving around container delivery, so it's certainly not limited to just adding a bunch of ships.

## Any gotchas?

* Containers deploy alongside the rest of your fighters and drones, so keep that in mind when you're in the heat of battle.
* Containers added by a container-hauling mission launch separately from your container ship, even if your own fighters/drones/containers are already docked.  This applies to all launches (haven't tested with wormholes yet).  Be sure to wait for your mission-added containers to redock between takeoff and jumping.
* Container-hauling missions currently don't have any multiplier for the number of containers or the distance involved.  [A bug/enhancement report has already been filed to hopefully rectify this.](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/2569)

## What's the license?

GPLv3, with some CC-BY-SA-4.0 artistic assets.

<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 40 expert crew members. Visit spaceports on human worlds with an outfitter to find the missions(5% chance).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(4) cooling(5) energy(4) engine(3) fuel(5) hull(3) jamming(4) scanner(4) shield(3) storage(5).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a medium human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>

<blockquote># hand-to-hand outfits
This is a plug-in for Endless Sky that adds a number of additional hand-to-hand outfits.

Outfits Include: Flack Vest, Tactical Armor, Stun Grenades, Tear Gas, Bolt Action Rifle, Blaster Rifle, Assault Rifle, Sidearm, Small Armory and Large Armory.

**Flack Vest** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a navy flack vest it increases capture attack and defense. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Tactical Armor** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a full suit of tactical body armor including a helmet. It is more expensive than the simple flack vest and provides a higher capture attack and defense. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Stun Grenades** - This hand-to-hand outfit is less expensive and less effective than fragmentation grenades. Unlike Fragmentation Grenades which are only available on pirate worlds stun grenades are available at various outfitters in Republic, Syndicate and Free Worlds space.

**Tear Gas** - This hand-to-hand outfit is more expensive and more effective than fragmentation grenades. Tear gas is available at a few select outfitters.

**Bolt Action Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is the least expensive and least effective. It is sold around the dirt belt purchased mostly by farmers to kill wildlife.

**Blaster Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is less expensive and less effective than the laser rifle. It is produced exclusively by The Syndicate and available at Syndicate outfitters.

**Assault Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is more expensive and more effective than the laser rifle. They are produced primarily for The Navy and are available at a few select outfitters. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Sidearm** - This hand-to-hand outfit is the least expensive and least effective weapon. They are low cost and available almost everywhere. Having them is better than being unarmed.

**Small Armory** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a selection of readily available offensive and defensive weapons to the crew increasing attack and defense capabilities. The armory takes up mass on the ship. The current art work being used as concept is from Rafael Ramawadh Plug-in Shields Up.

**Large Armory** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a selection of readily available offensive and defensive weapons to the crew increasing attack and defense capabilities. The armory takes up mass on the ship. The current art work being used as concept is from Rafael Ramawadh Plug-in Shields Up.

No new missions, licenses or events have been added all outfits are available at the start of the game.

<blockquote># Human-Space-Overhaul
 Alters Human-Tier Progression and unlocks

This is a progression overhaul focusing on human space, designed to vary human-tier outfits a bit more while also giving incentives to side with each human faction.

# Changelog

The South now has its own anti-missile turrets and sells all civilian shield generators (including two extra large shield generators for their carriers).
The Plasma turret and repeater are now available from the start of the game, however the repeater is locked behind the Militia license. Some free worlds unlocks have been adjusted accordingly.

The plasma repeater has been buffed slightly to make it a more alluring feature of siding with the militia.

The Syndicate now sells enhanced engines, better batteries, regenerators, a larger reactor, an upgraded proton turret and the ionic afterburner, most of which are locked behind a purchaseable license.

The Navy now has its own shield generators and active cooling outfits, both of which are substantially better than their competitors' offerings. Naturally, their outfits are locked behind their own license.

Many southern ships now use the new anti-missiles, and both Syndicate heavy warships use regenerators, their new engines, and their new batteries. Navy ships have been similarly reoutfitted to use their improved technology.

<blockquote># Endless Sky Korath Automation Upgrade
A plugin for [Endless Sky][endless-sky] which adds a new Korath Warship after the end of the Korath/Wanderer Co-Op Mission

![image][image]

Easier to capture than a Worldship, this 2.3 Tier Ship is obtainable after aiding the Wanderer/Korath in disabling the Kor Automata.
It does not replace the Korath Raider but rather complements it. If you do the Remnant Storyline after the Wanderer one, you will have an extra challenge with a few of these monstrosities. This Mod adds some challenge after beating the Automata out of Kor Efreti space

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Ship Modded

### How do I get this to work?

So you get my plugin by multiple ways...

1. Using `git clone https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded.git` (Recommended so you can use `git pull` to "update")

2. Going to [Git Repo](https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded) and selecting to download it as .zip or .tar.gz or some other compressed file (Not Recommended as it doesn't update easily)

From there locate your Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Linux: `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

Windows: `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\` (Replace yourusername with your PC's username)

Unpack/Unzip/Unrar or move the directory/folder into the Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Then restart Endless Sky if it's already running...

Enjoy!

### What is it?

This is a plugin/mod designed to provide special items that "cheat" or "hack" in the game, it allows you to modify just about everything on your ship all within game instead of needing to modify your save file.

My Primary Goal was so game developers/testers can travel through the game with ease.

My Secondary Goal was to make it so it's "Semi-Balanced" this way someone can still enjoy the original game without needing/depending on my mod/plugin.

My Third Goal was to make it so it's compatible with other plugins/mods that may be installed along side Ship Modded. (Such as All Content)

### License Info

This content uses GPL-3+ Licensing. (Yes we use quite a few of Endless Sky's Images and yes we want to give credit to them, thank you)

### What is added?

Added Outfits:

* AI Crew Replacement
* Anti-Scan Buffer
* Radar Jam Buffer
* Bunks Buffer
* Cargo Buffer
* Outfit Buffer
* Mass Debuffer
* Drag Debuffer
* Engine Buffer
* Weapon Buffer
* Storage Cell
* Energy Cube
* Fuel Cube
* Heat Sink
* Shield Modulator
* Repair Modulator
* Shield Buffer
* Hull Buffer
* Thrust Module
* Small/Medium/Large Frame
* Small/Medium/Large Matrix
* Warp Drive
* War Droid

Modified Outfits:

* You can now buy the Jump Drive from Pirates!

Hidden Outfits:

* Never Destroy (Tired of loosing drones/fighters/ships equip this and never worry again) (DANGER: Yes this is a Hack!)

>Expands outfit variety across all castes of vanilla Endless Sky.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Zoura's Outfits Expanded

This plugin aims to greatly expand outfit variety across all of Endless Sky; at the moment, every subfaction (except for the Quarg, Pug, and Drak) has received at least one outfit, though most have received more than that.
Also of note is that care has been made to ensure that outfits are all accessible by at least one means through normal, otherwise-vanilla gameplay (for example, Korath and Gegno outfits can be obtained by looting/capping, Human and Hai outfits via outfitters, et cetera).
The mod also features support for Darcy Manoel's Omnis as well, for those who'd like to cheat- I mean, play around with the outfits in an easily accessible environment.

The primary goal of this plugin is to increase the variety in vanilla's weapon and outfit selection while preserving a "vanilla-ish" level of balance, allowing players to mix plugin and vanilla content to where all-vanilla builds are still viable, but plugin outfits offer unique advantages for certain build types or simply new ways to interact with ship statistics (for example, there are several outfits that allow you to augment the strength of your shields and hull, but with noticeable downsides).

The above said, if something seems a bit too over/underpowered, please don't hesitate to give me a shout, either here on the github (through an issue or a PR of your own) or on discord @zoura3025 (I can also be found on the Endless Sky discord).
This plugin is also accepting community contributions! If you have an outfit you'd like to see implemented in this plugin's (lack of) style, please don't be afraid to drop an issue or PR.

 Warhammer 40k mod for Endless Sky
 
 REQUIRES: Endless Sky continuous version after 27 Feb 2022 to work. (Specifically commit dd7c20314c4a35d4017583bf1654891d06f11377)
 
![retribution](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19187937/140309820-abd6123c-cb61-4b81-9495-9ece214b55fa.PNG)

Currently have:

-15 Imperial Navy ships + outfits

-2 Tau ships + outfits

-1 Necron ship + outfits

Currently only Imperial ships and outfits can be purchased at forge world Pifitus at system Pyherrus south of Syndicate space. To access Tau ships and outfits AES Omnis is required.

Notes:
Stats are not 100% accurate to lore, most are somewhat reduced so Endless Sky can handle it, for example the number of crews are significantly reduced, most are slaves and servitors you don't really pay anyway. Mass is reduced so ships do not experience "bounce back" glitch when exiting hyperspace. Ships scales are half-calculated half-eyeballed to be a bit more practical in Endless Sky (tiny) scale. However, worry not about the weapon, they still pack the punch they should.(Thanks to their sheer scale compared to Endless Sky.)

### A Galaxy Far Far Away

>A mod designed to replicate Star Wars in Endless Sky.
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Endless Sky – A Galaxy Far Far Away (AGFFA)
A Galaxy Far Far Away (AGFFA) is an experimental plugin that brings the Star Wars franchise to Endless Sky (or at least tries to). Adding hundreds of ships, ranging from one-man starfighters to star destroyers or even star dreadnoughts, the plugin encompasses ships from a variety of eras and factions (The Old Republic, the Republic & CIS, the Empire & Rebels, the First Order & Resistance, and even some from Legends).

Currently, the plugin is highly unbalanced, has no existing storyline, has an incomplete galaxy, and is just a fun side project that I occasionally mess around with in my free time.

### Documentation 
(https://www.moddb.com/mods/endless-sky-a-galaxy-far-far-away)

### An important note:
I really don't know if this project will ever be completed (it's not a high priority for me), but I thought I might as well make it available for other people. If anybody would like to update the plugin for themselves, please feel free! I have no idea how Github works, so maybe duplicate the plugin into your own repositories so that I don't have to deal with any of the "pull request" stuff.

Currently, the plugin is unbalanced, buggy and overall frustrating at times, and I honestly don't know if any of these issues will ever be solved. (also please don't bombard me with questions)

### Useful Links:

### Videos:

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Known Issues:
1) The maximum number of turrets that a ship can have is 32, limiting the capital ships' abilities to fight
2) Starfighter AI struggle to deploy proton bombs properly due to their high drags
3) Similar to vanilla Endless Sky, starfighters can die far too easily
4) I have created both "Starfighter" and "Starfighter (Bay)" versions of each starfighter so that some may be docked while some cannot. This is less than ideal, but works alright
5) Ship balancing in general is pretty terrible at the moment (it's really quite difficult to follow SW lore)
6) Some computers are unable to load AGFFA due to the plugin's absurdly large file size
    
__________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Limitations:
1) The galaxy map is barely complete (only a few systems have been filled, though all of them have been created)
2) I didn't know whether to set the plugin in the Galactic Republic era, the Imperial era, or the New Republic/First Order era. (I added ships from all eras just in case –> including the Old Republic)
3) Outfits & weapons are currently just placeholders since I tried to standardise them just to make it easier for balancing.
4) Missions are currently non-existent (though I have added a few simply for the purposes of making some videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-_KH3Umhe4)
5) Fleets are also essentially non-existent, though there are a couple around.
6) I'm running out of things to say, but I'm sure some other problems will be discovered at some point.

__________________________________________________________________________________________________
### Adding ships:
The "images/ship" folder contains many ships that have been yet to be added to the plugin. If you wish to add them to the game, follow the steps below:
1) Scale the png. file down to a size that is comparable to the rest of the other ships (just estimate)
2) Use the website (endless-sky.github.io/ship_builder.html) to place engines, turrets and guns.
   Use the "Show Collision Mask" to identify any semi-transparent pixels
3) Add the ship to the corresponding txt. file in the "data" folder, including the correct outfits and hardpoints.
   - For the description, copy & paste from the wookiepedia entry of the ship.
4) Add the ship name to the "data/sales" txt. file.
5) Finished!

<blockquote># Amalgamation
A large collection of older plugins that have been edited and modified to work together with the newer versions of Endless Sky and be overall more balanced and lore friendly, along with many unique Amalgamation additions to fill out previous placeholders in these plugins.

The plugins included are: Shields Up, Enclave, Quarg Military Retaliation, ZRemnantX's ships, Tribute Plus, Space Conversion, Businessman, Inheritance ships, KorNewShips, Korath Automation Upgrade, Enigma Corps outfits, Cultures of the Southern Arm ships, Flamethrower Turret and The Machines are Taking Over.

General changes include: Adding a large number of ships into vanilla fleets all across the galaxy. Creating multiple new jobs, mercenaries, trade routes and missions to the game. Adding tons of new variants of ships to be used in many of the fleets that allow the new outfits in this plugin to be found naturally through gameplay. Changing the stats of a huge number of ships and outfits for balance and lore purposes. And finally overhauling all the fights in the main storylines to add more variance to the fleets you fight and to make it much harder to use the old stratagy of, "If we have enough ships, they will eventually run out of missiles to kill us with!"

Big thanks to BeccaBunny for the use of their sprites, allowing this plugin to have many unique ships and outfits.

To use this plugin fully, the latest release (9.9), Czartrak's Ship Pack plugin, Beccas expansion and the Adde plugin are needed. 

In addition to this the (Mission Overrides) folders files need to be moved into the "Endless Sky/data" folder and allowed to overright the files there for the campaigns to have the many ships this plugin adds included.

(Make sure to backup the overidden files otherwise only a reinstall will revert the game to the vanilla state!)

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Better Vanilla Pirates for Endless Sky

## 2.1

2.0 did not have Mk II Navy ships as they aren't purchasable in vanilla.

However then I realised the Navy License has been a planned part of the game for years, it's intended that player should be able to get access to these ships sooo - I decided to add Mk II Navy ships with no license requirement until the Navy license becomes obtainable in vanilla.

Balance feedback welcome

## 2.0

Human space has a huge and beautiful variety of ships to play with, but when player gets into mid-late game it's hard to justify using them compared to much stronger alien ships. 

2.0 keeps all 1.0 functionality (see below) and adds something new - player can now purchase highly buffed, "Mk II" human ships from New Tortuga after completing a short mission which also gives the player a free Mk II heavy warship as a reward. This is offered at New Tortuga, after player has completed Kestrel missions and FW story.

These Mk II ships have heavily buffed shields/hull, and in most cases slightly buffed outfit/weapon/engine space. They are generally slightly tankier than Hai/Remnant but nowhere near Wanderer/Automata, and they are rather expensive.

The Kestrel Mk II you are able to buy should respect your design choice in the Kestrel missions. The Kestrel Mk II and Dreadnought Mk II are buffed slightly less than the others due to already being relatively strong, and Bactrian is buffed far less due to it already being imba af.

The mission to unlock this stuff is completely optional, and even completing it won't change anything in your game other than allowing you to purchase upgraded ships if you wish. None of the new ships introduced are used by any NPC's, ambient or mission related. Yet.

If you encounter bugs pls report them.

## 1.0 Do you love vanilla ES everything but wish that the human pirates, bounty hunters and related combat missions (spaceport + job board), were a little more interesting, and stayed challenging with worthwhile mission payouts even in the late game?

Like I want to see pirates in Kestrels sometimes. And in military ships even more rarely. And maybe with alien outfits. Also I want to see pirates (and merchants too?) in weird variants like full proton Kestrel or particle Dreadnought or pulse cannon Firebird, etc.

This plugin is designed to enhance/improve/fill gaps in many aspects of pirate combat in Human space, especially in the late-game. It does not contain any new weapons/ships/sprites, or any new or replacement storylines, nor does it make the early game any harder. It achieves all this by the adding the following (POTENTIAL SPOILERS BELOW!)

- Dozens more pirate ship variants including 21 different Kestrel setups (7 for each of the Kestrel choices), like Proton Kestrels, Pulse cannon/Hai Tracker Bactrians and dozens of other combinations, military ships, more Marauder variants, some which have low level alien tech.

- Introduces pirates with Hai+limited Korath exile outfits (heat shunts only), and the Kestrel, and then finally Hai/Korath fitted Kestrels, into ambient pirate/merchant fleets, mission targets (as described above), and the Marauder Bounty Hunted fleet (that Marauder fleet that hunts you down occasionally if your combat rating is high enough).

- Introduces pirates in military ships including Dreadnought, Skein, Frigate, Gunboat after main story completion. You'll see these rarely in ambient fleets and as mission targets.

- *NEW* Minor mission thread with three instalments unlocked at CR9, 10, 11, and more incoming soon (up to CR 13 or 14). These involve a shady NPC who offers you detailed information on unique bounty hunting groups coming to get you. The next few instalments will involve a longer mission finale and unlocking some powerful upgraded human weapons.

- 30+ new combat missions (jobs and spaceport) with tonnes of variety and unusual low-chance variations in human space, complete with corresponding regional NPC assistance in many cases. These new missions include planetary defence, multiple wave planetary defence, nearby pirate blockade destruction and more. They range from 1mil to 20mil payouts, but the toughest jobs require extremely expensive fleets to complete without losses. Some of these involve very big fleet battles so take care!

- Note that no existing missions/jobs are altered, just new ones added. All new missions are repeating and can be declined with no penalty.

- Many new variations of the "Marauder Hunted" mission, the "invisible" mission present in vanilla, where Marauder Bounty Hunters will occasionally hunt you down without warning if your combat rating is high enough. These new variations scale with combat rating, and come in two distinct flavours; small, homogeneous fleets of elite heavy warships with expensive outfit combinations, and larger rag-tag fleets including all types of ships.

- Additions described above that are based on storyline completion or Kestrel mission completion are applied retroactively. This means that you'll see all the changes on a save where you've completed these already, at least after you land once or twice post plugin install.

- *NEW* Now adds Korath Automata raid missions (spaceport) on certain Syndicate systems after the Korath Exiles start producing automata. Just like the Raider Attack missions in vanilla, just with Automata. You can now farm Sestor/Mereti ships post Wanderer storyline!

- Dozens of new pirate variants (new outfit combinations for existing ships).


## How does this actually change my game?

- With this plugin installed, your game will be completely vanilla everywhere early game.

- Once your combat rating gets past 9 (or if it is already), you'll start to see much more difficult combat jobs/spaceport missions, over 30 region specific variations, all over human space, vs new pirate fleet compositions. These missions start off with lots of enemy variety but will see more variation pirate ships and outfits as the main FW storyline and kestrel missions are completed, more detail on that below. The most difficult jobs also have low-chance variations with extra cool NPC assistance!

- As your combat rating continues to increase (up to a CR of 13), tougher and more varied Bounty Hunter fleets will hunt you down, and as above, these fleets become more varied with player progression. The spawn rate of these remains identical to vanilla. These fleets will keep you on your toes at all times in Human space, and force you to keep your combat and cargo/transport ships close or risk losing them. Tougher spaceport/job board missions will be unlocked at each combat rating from 8 to 12.

- After you complete the main FW storyline (or if you've already completed it), you'll start to see merchants and pirates will sometimes be outfit with limited alien tech, and pirates will sometimes be seen in Military ships (Skein, Cruiser, Gunboat etc) in corresponding regions. You'll also start to see alien tech fit Marauder fleets in the new missions as described above.

- After you complete the Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll notice merchants and pirates start to occasionally appear in a wide range of Kestrel outfits, in the model that corresponds to your design choice in the Kestrel missions. This means if you choose weapons, you'll see 12 gun pirate Kestrels that actually use them all! Kestrels will also be seen occasionally in the missions described above.

- After you complete both the main FW storyline and Kestrel missions (or if you've already completed them), you'll see the occasional limited alien tech fitted Kestrel, both in ambient merchant/pirate fleets, and in the missions described above.

- Once you complete the Wanderer missions where the Korath Exiles begin using Sestor/Mereti automata as their own, some Syndicate systems will offer spaceport defence missions where the Korath are raiding the system with JD equipped automata! The payouts for these missions are relatively low, but they allow the player to obtain Sestor/Mereti ships after the Wanderer campaign (not possible in vanilla).


The job board/spaceport missions are designed to be quite difficult at times even for large fleets so take care. You may find that human missiles become a serious problem in large numbers, with the large impact force capable of isolating and destroying your escorts with ease, anti-missile turrets may come in very handy.

Please make backups of your pilot file before using this plugin. The changes this plugin makes to fleets (adding pirates/merchants with Hai tech, adding pirate/merchant Kestrels, etc) are stored in your save file. If you remove the plugin, it may not work anymore. Backup your pilot file just in case you don't like this plugin.

Enjoy!

>A story-driven variation of the 2015 game Endless Sky, the spiritual successor to Escape Velocity. You can still explore other star systems.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>Build instructions:



Linux:

Use your favorite package manager to install the following (version numbers may vary depending on your distribution):

DEB-based distros:
   g++ \
   scons \
   libsdl2-dev \
   libpng-dev \
   libjpeg-dev \
   libgl1-mesa-dev \
   libglew-dev \
   libopenal-dev \
   libmad0-dev

RPM-based distros:
   gcc-c++ \
   scons \
   SDL2-devel \
   libpng-devel \
   libjpeg-turbo-devel \
   mesa-libGL-devel \
   glew-devel \
   openal-soft-devel \
   libmad-devel

You can then just navigate to the source code folder in a terminal and type:

  $ scons
  $ ./endless-sky

The program will run using the "data" and "images" folders that are found in the source code folder itself. For more Linux help, consult the man page (endless-sky.6).



Windows:

The Windows build has been tested on 64-bit Windows 7, only. You will need the Code::Blocks IDE and g++ 4.8 or higher. Code::Blocks is available here:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeblocks/files/Binaries/13.12/Windows/codeblocks-13.12-setup.exe/download

You can install g++ separately through mingw-w64:

  http://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw-w64/files/Toolchains%20targetting%20Win64/Personal%20Builds/mingw-builds/4.8.5/threads-posix/seh/

*** Be sure to install the "pthread" version of MinGW. The "win32-thread" one does not come with support for C++11 threading. If you are using 32-bit Windows, install the compiler for "dwarf" exceptions, not "sjlj." ***

If you are on 64-bit Windows, a full set of development libraries are available here:

  http://endless-sky.github.io/win64-dev.zip

If you don't want to have to edit the paths in the Code::Blocks file, unpack the "dev64" folder directly into C:\.

If you are using 32-bit Windows, a full set of development libraries are available here:

  http://endless-sky.github.io/win32-dev.zip

You will probably need to adjust the paths to your compiler binaries, and you should also switch to the "Win32" build instead of the "Debug" or "Release" build.

You will also need libmingw32.a and libopengl32.a. Those should be included in the MinGW g++ install. If they are not in C:\Program Files\mingw64\x86_64-w64-mingw32\lib\ you will have to adjust the paths in the Code::Blocks file.



Mac OS X:

To build Endless Sky, you will first need to download Xcode from the App Store.

Next, install Homebrew (from http://brew.sh).

ARM Processors:

  If you have an ARM processor, such as the Apple M1, you will need to install an x86_64 version of Homebrew. You can do this by running the normal install command through an `arch` terminal:

  $ arch -x86_64 zsh

  You may find it useful to define an alias that you can use to interact with your x86_64 homebrew:

  alias brex="arch -x86_64 /usr/local/Homebrew/bin/brew"

  Use this alias instead of `brew` in any subsequent homebrew commands.

  Before continuing, make sure that your x86_64 Homebrew install is prefixed to `/usr/local`:

  $ brex --prefix
  /usr/local

Once Homebrew is installed, use it to install the libraries you will need:

  $ brew install pango cairo libpng libjpeg-turbo libmad sdl2

ARM version:

  $ brex install pango cairo libpng libjpg-turbo libmad sdl2

If the versions of those libraries are different from the ones that the Xcode project is set up for, you will need to modify the file paths in the “Frameworks” section in Xcode.

It is possible that you will also need to modify the “Header Search Paths” and “Library Search Paths” in “Build Settings” to point to wherever Homebrew installed those libraries.

Library paths

To create a Mac OS X binary that will work on systems other than your own, you may also need to use install_name_tool to modify the libraries so that their location is relative to the @rpath.

$ sudo install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libpng16.16.dylib" /usr/local/lib/libpng16.16.dylib
$ sudo install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libmad.0.2.1.dylib" /usr/local/lib/libmad.0.2.1.dylib
$ sudo install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libturbojpeg.0.dylib" /usr/local/opt/libjpeg-turbo/lib/libturbojpeg.0.dylib
$ sudo install_name_tool -id "@rpath/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib" /usr/local/lib/libSDL2-2.0.0.dylib

Jokes aside, welcome to Endless Sea, a total conversion mod of Endless Sky. The objective of this total conversion is to give Endless Sky a more maritime theme, with all the quirks that come with it.

Currently, this is a pre-pre-pre-alpha, and is extremely primitive in all aspects. Please direct all criticism to me; feel free to post reviews in the issues board, or even go ahead and PR your own contributions! I welcome all forms of help, trust me. Be it island images, balance suggestions, and so on; I'm very happy to get others' feedback, especially this early on.

Full tranparency, this is built off of an install of Samrocketman's fork, which can be found here -> https://github.com/samrocketman/endless-sky/tree/continuous-with-plugins

<blockquote># Endless Endless Sky
 Procedural generation plugin for open source game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)

 Partially derived from Nucleartaxi's [Endless Sky Generators](https://github.com/Nucleartaxi/endless-sky-generators)

Primarily a script to generate entire galaxy along with its content from systems, governments(aliens) with their own ships fully outfitted with each faction own outfits and even generated ship sprites.


WARNING: Highly experimental, may not stable enough for regular gameplay.

WARNING: Data folder and generated sprites will be reset every update to utilize new features, backup what you like.

## How to use:
 Requires: Python 3.9+, and Pillow 8.4.0+ (For ship sprite generation)
 This plugin can be installed normally like any other plugin. Pre-generated data is provided [here](https://github.com/1010todd/Endless-Endless-Sky/releases/tag/v0.1.0) if you don't want to run the script.
 
 To run the generator, simply run main.py and wait. If success the console will say so and wait for input before closing.
 
 Some part of the generator can be configured, check instructions.txt to see which can be used. (very messy right now, some option works, some don't, will fix later)

<blockquote># Galactic-War
This is a repository for endless sky mod "Galactic War"
The mod is currently in development stage, many things are subjected to changes later on.

Currently the mod requires Endless Sky version 0.9.15+ to work properly.

![GWcap2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19187937/152830096-35d610a9-1fde-46a0-b4b8-694035cab411.PNG)

## About
This is a massive content mod about a war in another galaxy. While no storyline exist yet there's a large galaxy to explore filled with various aliens with different advancement and specializations.

Currently the plugin consist of:

* 1 Accessible galaxy.

* 26+ Races with their own ships and outfits. Some with unique mechanic such as territory changes or even hunt you down depending on your interactions.

* Over 100 Ships,

* Over 600 Outfits,

* Over 1500 Systems.

## Accessing the Contents

To find the galaxy, head up to the system north of Ka'ch'chrai(The capital) in the Wanderer space, the wormhole will be in between Sko'karak and Pug Iyik

This plugin is complatible with Omnis and World Forge developer plugins, though, World Forge support will be missing some functions and may be slightly outdated.

## Known Issues
Galaxy image not appearing. To fix this, turn on "reduce large graphic" option in the setting and restart the game.

Game slowing down when jumping with hyperdrive. Due to the number of systems this plugin add and game's pathfinding, unfortunately the only fix is to get better hardware.

Game slowing down/freezing when escorts have high-range jump drive. Similar reason to above, use shorter-ranged jump drive or don't use escorts.

## Download
To download the lastest (development) version, press the green [code] button and download as zip from this repository.

To install you can extract the zip in your plugin folder.

High-DPI plugin for Galactic War:

For 4k monitors or if ships/outfits look blurry, you can download this plugin for sprites with higher resolution;
https://github.com/1010todd/Galactic-War-hi-dpi

Lite version: (Very Outdated)

This version will have less animation frames and exclude @2x images to reduce memory required to load the plugin. Use this if you're using low end machines or 32 bit machines.

## Contact
If you found any bug/issue or have some suggestion, feel free to open an issue here or find me in Endless Sky Community discord server; https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx 

I'll sometime update development progress there in #plugin chat.

>Pug Defense is a small but extremely challenging plugin which adds a system to the south of the galaxy, accessible only by jump drive. In the system, corrupted pug fleets will spawn, extremely hostile and after your blood, however, should you be strong enough, you can challenge the planets and demand tribute. The defenders are like nothing you've ever seen before, including the peak of Pug technology, the Pug Perfecta.
>
>To access the plugin content, first land on any planet to initialize the missions. Then go to the Sard system and jump south from there to a new system, Sylansia Lost. From there, landing on Monolith will begin the quest chain.

<blockquote># Sci-Fi-Flavours
An Endless Sky plugin.

This is version 1.0 of a Plugin that's intended to gently eventually incorporate all of my favourite science fiction content into Endless Sky.
It's a work in progress but since I am just about to start my first full playthrough of version 1.0 I thought I would share it with the Endless Sky community.

On my first playthrough I will be building a list of balance fixes and making notes on better mission/storyline integration.
If you have feedback I'd love to hear it, especially if you have ideas for balance and or ship variants. So send me your best ship + outfits combinations!
(linearperk@gmail.com)

This Plugin contains:
  - About 100 new ships  
  - About 100 new outfits/weapons
  - No changes to storyline missions
  - More starter ships and increased start money (1 million)

To do list:
  - Hi Res sprites/images
  - Integration with campaign
  - New missions to gradually introduce plugin content
  - Learn how to create new sprites with blender :)
 
# Acknowledgments

I have been playing with, mixing, remixing, and modifying the content and assets from all of the following excellent plugins. I have used them as a guide and in some cases I've taken my favourite content and reproduced it in the Sci-Fi Flavours mod with only small tweaks to balance.

# Installation

(From the Endless Sky Wiki)
https://endless-sky.fandom.com/wiki/Mods

Installing mods is simple: place the folder containing the mod files in a folder labeled "plugins" in one of the following locations, depending on your operating system.
Linux

    /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
    ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

Windows

    plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
    C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

Mac OS X

    Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
    ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

The end result should be something like [file-path]\endless-sky\plugins\[plugin-name], which in turn will contain that specific mod's data, images, and sounds folders, and possibly readme and copyright info.

<blockquote># Akasha Chronicles
A plugin for [Endless Sky][endless-sky] that adds a complete storyline with new alien factions.

Original author: Gillax.
Original source: https://www.reddit.com/r/endlesssky/comments/5lw3oy/plugin_akasha_chronicles_release/

![image][image]

[endless-sky]: https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky
[image]: images/planet/akasha.png

Akasha Chronicles is a progressive storyline giving you access to new technology and ships over time.

Featuring:
* New Goverments
* 16 New Ships
* 30 New Outfits and Weapons
* Storyline with around 30 Missions with lots of dialog and choices (hope you will make the right ones)
* 40 New Systems, Planets, Land and event sprites to bring a fitting atmosphere for the story (google images)
* Some hidden outfits which you can get during missions (going places you perhaps shouldn't)
* Changing Environment

You can start the storyline in the Kor Efret Space (the nice Koraths) after you finish the Wanderers storyline. 
The difficulty should be a good fit for people who are done with the Wanderers storyline.

## Installation
You must create a "plugins" folder in one of two places, depending on your operating system:

### Linux ###
* /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
* ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

### Windows ###
* plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
* C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

### Mac OS X ###
* Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
* ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

Download the latest [release][releases] and extract it into your plugins folder.

More information may be available on the [Endless Sky Wiki][wiki].

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Arion - Air Superiority

An Endless Sky plugin that adds a variety of things to endless sky, including: 

- Real life fighters
  
- Real life bombers
  
- Ace combat super planes
  
- Xenonauts fighters
  
- A bunch of new H2H weapons based on real life weapons
  
- Advanced outfits
  
- Specialized weapons
  
- Superweapons
  
- Custom capital ships
  
- 1 (or 2) new 'short campaigns' and some new jobs
  
- ETC

To get access to some of the content visit Earth, Valhalla, Hephaestus or Bourne. Perhaps helping them out by doing some jobs and mission is a good idea. You can also just have a high combat rating or finish the main campaign (although you should probably just visit the mentioned planets).

There are also some bonus content if you have the lost in midnight, mega freight, czartraks ships, amphibious ships or navycampaign (by kestrel1110) plugin. To access the bonus content, move the respective files from the bonus file to the data file.

(Special thanks to 1010todd, yuyuko_saigyouji. and gefulltetaubenbrust from the Endless Sky discord server for letting me borrow some sprites)

1. About the Mod
2. Installation Instructions
3. Tips
4. Versions and Bug Fixes
5. Known Issues


1. About the Mod
	The Core Mining, Inc. mod adds a storyline that offers you the chance to work for a newly
started company called Core Mining. You start with them from the very beginning and help build
up the company. Along the way, you can make different choices which may impact the game at a
later time, as well as potentially make major changes to the plotline. Not everything is in
place yet, but I'm hoping to make a plugin that fits in seamlessly with the vanilla game.
There is a major alternate story that goes with the main one that still needs to be written
and I also would like input on the difficulty of the missions as well as typos and glitches
in the mod. Any other suggestions on the overall flow and quality of the mod are appreciated
as well.
						Thanks for reading, and enjoy!
													DJF113


2. Installation Instructions

	for Microsoft Windows
		1. Download the "Core Mining, Inc." mod
		2. Extract folder "Core Mining, Inc" into the Endless Sky plugins folder:
		   C:\Users\"your username"\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins
		   You will have to select "show hidden files and folders" in the folder options
		   menu to find the AppData folder unless you have already done so.


3. Tips

	The first mission is offered within two jumps of the Delta Capricorni system, and won't
		trigger until after 4 June 3014.
	
	I normally start the mod with a Berserker, then use the money you make to work my way up
		from there. Not everything is set in stone at the moment, but it's going to be easier
		to use that than a Sparrow!


4. Versions and Bug Fixes

-0.0.1-
	Started the Alpha version of Core Mining, Inc. by writing the first five missions into
		the CMI Part 1 file. I also created a temporary start file for the first stages of
		testing. This will be deleted later on and the first mission will not be offered on
		Maker every time. Also started the following files: events, fleets, governments, and
		names; all containing customized things for the mod. None of the info in these files
		will be used until CMI Part 2 though.

-0.0.2-
	Fixed some spelling errors and (hopefully) improved some of the mission dialogue.
		Hopefully more improvements in the dialogue coming soon.

-0.0.3-
	Finished the last two missions of the CMI Part 1 file. Players will now receive a 5000
		credit salary after completing the seventh mission. (Salary subject to change later
		on.) Working on a problem with the player swizzle not changing. Also added an icon
		and description that will show up on the plugins screen.

-0.0.4-
	Added all seven of the missions in the CMI Part 2 file. Mission #'s are: 8A, 8B, 9, 10A,
		10B, 11, and 12. A little bit more work with the events and fleets file, some of which
		will not be used until later on. I have not figured out anything with the swizzle
		problem yet. I may have to do some research on it.

-0.1.0-
	The Core Mining, Inc. mod is now version 0.1! The changes in this version were mostly
		spelling mistakes and an issue where the pirate fleet was twice the size I wanted it.
		I decided to move from Alpha to Beta since the basic testing and parts one and two of
		the storyline are finished. I have the general ideas for parts three, four, and five
		and some more ideas as well...

-0.1.1-
	Wrote all seven missions in the CMI Part 3 file. Several more events added, including one
		that slows down the amount of Korath Raids in the Durax system during mission 19.

-0.1.2-
	Just fixed a few spelling errors and some minor bugs that cropped up from version 0.1.1.

-0.1.3-
	Finished writing and added all of the missions in the CMI Part 4 file. You will also
		notice a CMI Part 5 file. This only has one mission at this point as it was written to
		test the final mission in the Part 4 string. I've also renamed all of the missions so
		you will either have to create new savegames or do some editing to your save file to
		keep playing your current savegame. The reason for the renaming is to make inserting
		missions at a later point easier.

-0.1.4-
	The CMI storyline will now no longer be available if you have played very far into the
		Free Worlds story. The specific event is "chosen sides", set once you have decided to
		join up with them. Also all of the missions are no longer in the "CMI Part" files, but
		in the "CMI Section" files. Parts 1-4 are in the Section 1 file and Parts 5-? will be
		in the Section 2 file once they are completed. It's not too many changes for the version,
		but I feel it cleans things up considerably.

-0.1.5-
	Removed the map file from the mod because of overlap with version 0.9.8 of Endless Sky.
		Finished and tested the missions in the CMI S2 Part 1 and CMI S2 Part 2 file.

-0.1.6-
	Changed the icon that shows up in the mod list. Added the "Tips" section to the readme
		file. Added Autosave feature to all missions. Wrote the CMI S2 Part 3, and Part 4 file,
		then combined them with parts 1 and 2 into the CMI Section 2 file. Designed an Under
		Construction mission that should (hopefully!) make it easier to get the next mission
		once an update comes out. CMI S3 Part 1 only contains the Under Construction mission.

-0.1.7-
	Fixed an issue where I forgot to add ship names for some of the npcs. Fixed a bug
		mentioned by Der_König where the destination name was wrong. Added a proof of concept
		CMI transport mission, and a mission that shows up when the new fusion reactor is
		available. Fixed an issue with the CMI reactor thumbnail not working. Also added several
		events that inject CMI into the game, even when the storyline has not been used in a
		playthrough. Multiple other bug fixes. Finished Section 3 of the main branch of the
		storyline, and started work on Section 4 as well. Made some changes to the bounty
		hunting mission, which included lowering the level of the nemesis ship, and giving you
		an unmarked escort. Added landscape to Keselrig.

-0.1.8-
	Very small update fixing a bug where a mission wouldn't show up.


5. Known Issues

	It's not finished! :-)
	Missions do not have passenger and freight quantities set yet. (This should be inserted
		once the storyline is closer completion.)
	Combat missions tend to not be balanced.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># KorExiles-PA
Korath Exiles Post Automata
Long term, what I'm planning for this stuff is a set of missions responding to their re-acquisition of the automata by synthesizing their focuses against the new threat of the Wanderers and the growing danger of the Remnant, mostly with long ranged weaponry which can double on world defense as well as artillery set ups.

Start introduces Screener and Ionizer.

Screener is answer to superior but slower AMs of both, especially coupled in fleets with the Firestorm torpedo introduced in KEE. It will very much rely on the redocking to reload behavior, though, and I'm gonna have to play around with the Piercer Pod stats in Revamp - it needs some serious tweaking/buffing to be worth using over normal piercers, even at it's smaller size.

Energzier is answer to Wanderer HWs and Remnant kiters, providing ranged disruption (by channeling disruptors through detainer rig) to stack onto beam combos or enhance various piercing weapons. It is slightly heavier, does negative energy and ion damage, and less slow than normal detainer, but has longer range and larger AoE.

From there, a split is introduced with one group working on the KIV 750 artillery platform and it's giant spinal mount weapon, and the other working on deployable artillery with the above spinal versions of the FO.

Eventually you're faced with a decision to strike against one of the reserach/production facilities, and in the ensuing retaliation and for a good while afterwards, the other line appears much more often in fleets and events.

<blockquote># ZRemnantX
Zitchas' Test-Bed plugin for Endless Sky. This plug-in is not intended for general distribution, but rather serves as a temporary holding area for various ideas and thing that I am testing or have recently been tested. It isn't balanced, and sometimes breaks things. It also serves as a holding spot for a lot of lore that I work with, such as the timeline for Remnant stuff.

# The Remnant
The Remnant were originally a group of humans who fled human space in the early years of the Alpha War, circa 2455. They fled in secret, and intentionally made sure that there was no record of them or their departure. Their fear was that the Alpha's would win, and humanity would be destroyed, and thus they sought to establish new worlds where humanity might survive in hiding. To this end they cut off all contact with human systems, and avoid traveling in systems close to the edge of known human space in order to prevent anyone from being able to follow them home.



# Timeline notes (definitive)
First Contact with the Quarg: 2320

The Alpha War: 2450-2470

Player start year: 3013

# Timeline notes (speculative)

2454 Departure from human space

2455 Founding of Caelian

2456 Founding of Aventine

2457 Founding of Viminal

2600-2900 First time they were attacked by a ship with a weapon that interfered with ship engines (possibly a Korath Detainer? These are currently only found on Tek Far 78 - Osk, Tek Far 71 - Lek, Tek Far 109, Kar Ik Vot 349, and Met Par Tek 53 (Sniper).)


 endless-sky commented on May 21, 2017

The Sheragi discovered spaceflight around 100,000 years ago, about the time of the peak of the Hai empire, around the same time that the ancestors of modern humans began "banging rocks together." The Sheragi civilization survived less than a millennium after that.

The Hai discovered spaceflight about 120,000 years ago, and their civil wars stretched from about 95,000 to 90,000 years ago. 90,000 years ago, the Hai pulled back from "human" space and from the ruined worlds to the north of them, and 80,000 years ago the Wanderers moved into that northern territory.

The Korath, Saryds, Kimek, Arachi, and finally the humans, discovered spaceflight 40, 17, 14, 10, and 1 thousand years ago, respectively. Note that that means that new spacefaring species have been appearing more and more frequently in recent history, which is part of why the Archons have been having so much trouble holding things together lately.

<blockquote># Star-Wars-Map-in-Endless-Sky
The current goal is to have every system from Star Wars Legends placed as accurately as
possible (within reason), and to have sector borders, trade routes, and important
astronomical features such as the Void of Chopani labled.

Delete the ui folder in images if the background looks like garbage in-game.  Anything
contained in there is meant for development, and will make seeing anything very difficult.

The images shown in the background are screenshots from http://www.swgalaxymap.com/
The orange systems are systems that appear in Canon, and the blue systems are systems
that appear exclusively in Legends.  Many of the most important systems such as Hoth
and Byss appear in both Canon and Legends, and are thus orange.  For this reason, some
orange systems have been added to the map while others have been left alone.

Most systems do not have exact locations given in any official map, and liberty has been taken in a few
instances where perfectly accurate placement of systems would result in unreadable system names due to
how close together those systems are.  See the Tharin sector for an example, the space in and around the
Periphary region in particular.  It can be searched for in game by searching for the Dles system just above
Hutt Space.  Note how the systems in that area do not line up with the systems on the inserted screenshots.

Every system in the main Endless Sky map is included in the map.txt with the exception of Rutilicus*.
This is because a number of systems in Endless Sky have the same name as systems in Star Wars, see Rigel
and Capella as examples.  In these instances, the systems have been renamed to be slightly different from
what they actually are in Star Wars.  Rigel has been renamed Rigellia after the Rigellian race that are from
Rigel, and Capella has been renamed Greater Capella due to the presence of the Little Capella system in the
same sector.

Also included in the "Basic Outfits" are a handful of maps that will make exploring the SW galaxy not
become a massive and unbearable chore that takes about an hour even with 1,000 fuel processors and a JD,
yes I have done that before and I am still salty that I didn't just add the map outfit in the first place.

Because the current map does not have any inhabited systems, a very...potent ship will be required to
navigate the galaxy.  Included is a save file that has a ship that will be able to navigate the galaxy with
relative ease.  Note that it does not have a JD.  This is because the map is not designed with a JD in
mind.  The map was designed with the Star Wars trade routes in mind, and thus funnels players to the trade
routes rather than allowing them to roam freely as a JD would allow for.

* The Rutilicus system is not present so that it is still possible to access the Omnis plugin galaxy if you
have the Omnis plugin installed.

~36% of systems are in place, with 5785 systems expected to be the final count.

<blockquote># The-Evora-Navaiya
This is a workspace for my mod for Endless Sky, the Evora Navaiya.

The Evora Navaiya adds two alien species to the southwest of Coalition space; the Evora Navaiya and the Doyek.
There are more spoilers below, but all of the information, when the mod is completed, will eventually be available in the mod itself and so, if you plan on playing, I would advise against reading.

# MOD IS CURRENTLY NON-FUNCTIONAL
The Evora Navaiya are an isolated alien species, similar in structure to humans, though overall their skin tone is darker, they have colorful scales on many parts of their body, and they are much, much taller. Both males and females regularly grow in excess of eight feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.
They live in a territory to the southwest of Coalition space but are isolated by a curious star system.

The Doyek neighbor the Evora Navaiya's isolated star system, being barely reachable from Human Space with a Jump Drive. They are a far younger species than the Evora, and not nearly as advanced. Biologically, they appear as quadruped dragon-like creatures, as if they came straight from the human world of Skymoot, but they aren't very large comparatively, only about 10 feet tall at most (with a large wingspan of about 25 feet), though they weigh in close to a ton. Unlike those Skymoot dragons though, the Doyek's intelligence is closer to the Skymoot dragons' ancestors, the Sheragi, or possibly smarter.

<blockquote># Trin Enhancement for Endless Sky

## The Trin

The Trin are a proposed hostile, Tier 3 alien species. I'm designing them with the following objectives:

1. Provide a late game challenge for an experienced player's fleet, which makes a bit more story sense than farming the Quarg.
2. Offer a great range of outfits: weapons that might compete with the Quarg Skylance, and other outfits balanced to the Wanderers/Korath.
3. To be relatively ‘low impact’ in terms of territory and storyline. Their territory is long lost, and their planned stories try to fit into the existing setting.
4. To push the boat out mechanically: their missiles shoot bomb-pumped lasers, their Matrix Guns do more damage the closer they hit, a rare ship variant creates illusions of itself, and more...


## Background

They raid the galactic north from the Wanderers to the Korath, checked by the Quarg in Hai and Efreti space. The Trin were once an advanced civilisation, a long time ago. They rose to a great height, but their continued warring became ever more dangerous. Eventually, their atrocities caught the attention of the Drak, who sought to contain the threat.

The Trin refused all conditions of surrender, and while they were no match for the Drak and the Quarg, they fought an endless guerrilla war. Their civilisation was lost, but their Trin Fabricators (molecular assemblers) and underground hives helped them seed themselves across the galaxy and fight back. They bloodied the Quarg in battle, and even injured a few Archons.

Eventually, the Drak lost patience. They fell back on an ultimate sanction: a weapon that completely destroyed all intelligent Trin life.

They miscalculated. The Trin have two species – or perhaps two sexes. Their Queens were intelligent and civilised, and the Drak’s weapon killed every one. Their drones are strong, obedient, good at performing a given task but with no autonomy of their own. The Drak’s weapon did not affect the Trin drones. Millenia have passed, and Trin drones continue to fulfill their dead Queens’ dying wishes for war.

They seed new hives on uninhabited worlds, build new ships, and attack with no concept of free will, strategy, or mercy. They no longer recognise enemy or civilian. They’re a mindless husk of a dead species, fighting a war that’s already lost: a galactic pest. The Drak task the Quarg with eradicating hives before they ‘hatch’, and defending the Hai and Efreti from the few Trin that reach them. Despite their advanced technology, this has been enough to keep the fallen Trin mostly in check.

At least, so far.


## Gameplay

The Trin have no fleet presence. They appear through rare, usually invisible ‘raid’ missions. In Hai and Efreti space, Quarg will show up to help – eventually.

1. 7 new Tier 3 ships: Piranha fighters, Raja interceptors, Marlin light warships, Chimaera medium warships, Cachalot heavy freighters and Mako and Antiarch heavy warships. Only the first three can realistically be captured.
2. 7-11 new weapons: Phase Reapers, Matrix Guns/Batteries, Stasis Snares, Hunter-Killer Pods, Hunter-Seeker Pods and the mighty Arcblade. More rarely you’ll find Phase Reaper Turrets, Empyreal Fields, Wakefield Mortars and Hunter-Trapper Pods. 
3. 16 new outfits, including competitive alternatives to Wanderer/Korath reactors, Wanderer regenerators, Korath/Coalition cooling, Quarg batteries and Hai engines. Plus some other cool stuff. Everything except their better reactors can be obtained.
4. The Mebsuta Hive arc, a 10 mission arc encountering a mysterious alien threat under the worst circumstances.
5. The Hai Research arc, a 9 mission arc investigating the technology and origin of the Trin. Also repeating Hai missions warning of Trin raids once your combat rating is high enough.
6. The Wanderer Defence arc, about 6 missions dealing with a Trin hive.
7. The Trin Queen arc, about 4 missions finding out much more about the Trin’s origin, from a very different perspective.
8. The Dreadhand’s Challenge, a 2 mission story where you can respond to (or ignore) a challenge from an infamous pirate lord with some pretty unusual technology.

## Code Dependencies

**_[STABLE]_** **[Beta](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/beta)** – a combined branch of all relatively stable features / code dependencies. Feel free to compile this and have a look around. I'll make pre-compiled executables available at some point, but in the long run the hope is that all code dependencies can be accepted into Endless Sky.

1. _**[DONE]**_  **[RangeCalculation](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/RangeCalculation)** – a tweak to Endless Sky’s range calculation to handle random lifetime/velocity and submunition velocity, needed to get certain Trin weapons (like the Phase Reaper and Arcblade) to be used effectively by the AI. 
2. _**[DONE]**_  **[NoCollision](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/NoCollision)** – a new weapon attribute that allows for munitions that don’t hit anything, needed for proper operation of some fancy Trin weapons (like the Empyreal Field and Arcblade).
3. _**[DONE]**_  **[EffectResistances](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/EffectResistances)** – Trin shield regenerators provide resistance to disruption and piercing damage. (The branch also creates slowing and ion resistance, not used by the Trin.)
4. _**[DONE]**_  **[MoreJammingTypes](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/MoreJammingTypes)** – creates optical, infrared and untyped jamming, as the Trin use a fancy Tier 3 jammer. (Untyped not used.)
5. _**[DONE]**_  **[ShipsConditions](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/ShipsConditions)** – ability to key a mission off your fleet size is used in the Dreadhand’s Challenge.
6. _**[DONE]**_ **[TurretFiringArc](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/TurretFiringArc)** – any weapon (turret or gun) can have a "swivel degrees" attribute, allowing it to swivel within that range. Needed so that Swivel Matrix Guns can fire in a +/- 30 degree arc.
6. _**[DONE]**_ **[OperationalEnergy](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/OperationalEnergy)** - rather than having negative energy generation, an outfit that should constantly drain energy now uses positive "operational energy". This is needed to fix some incompatibilities with solar collection, and also to make it possible to equip Strangelet Adapters before reactors.
7. _**[DONE]**_ **[ExcessiveSpeedDecay](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/ExcessiveSpeedDecay)** – ships cannot obtain limitless speed when using a weapon with firing force to thrust. Needed to balance the Warp Ray.
8. _**[DONE, REVISE]**_  **[TechConditions](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/TechConditions)** – any outfit or ship can have attributes beginning with "tech: ", and they will automatically be turned into auto-conditions that can be used for mission logic. Needed for the Trin Queen arc to trigger on having _any_ piece of Trin technology in your fleet.
9. _**[TESTING]**_  **[JammingHaywire](https://github.com/Elyssaen/endless-sky/tree/feature/JammingHaywire)** – to make jammers effective in AI-on-AI combat at Tier 3, this makes it possible to ‘confuse’ jammed missiles into veering off.
10. _**[PLANNED]**_ **MoreJammingHaywire** – combination of MoreJammingTypes and JammingHaywire.
11. _**[PLANNED]**_ **GiftShip** – a feature to let a mission give you a ship, needed for a mission reward.
12. _**[NO IDEA YET]**_  **OutfitTransparency** – Trin jammers need to make the ship equipping them translucent.

<blockquote># Ultaka Invasion
 Experimental content plugin for open source game Endless Sky
 
# (IMPORTANT)PREREQUIRES:
Endless Sky version 0.9.15 (Continuous) or higher

[Galactic War plugin](https://github.com/1010todd/Galactic-War)

For most of the asset.

[Omnis plugin](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky/-Omnis):

To trigger the invasion.

This plugin WILL NOT work without the above two plugins.

## Optional supported plugin:

[Beyond the Sky](https://github.com/1010todd/Beyond-the-Sky):

Quarg will respond to invasion by deploying better warships that are more of a match to the Ultaka. Ultaka will also deploy extra ships in response.

Shields Up:

Ultaka will also attack everyone else in their way.

Others:

Ultaka will attack everyone (If I'm aware of something, I'll add it to aggro list.)

# About
Ultaka Invasion (or lengthier its name Ultaka Invasion of Milky Way) is an experimental plugin where Milky Way is invaded by highly advanced alien, featuring mechanics for planet invasion and allowing player to retake planets and hire warships to defend it. No story planned beside small missions to make factions react to the invasion(mostly WIP).

Just for fun, not recommended for regular gameplay as multiple feature might break vanilla missions and the balance is very questionable.

My first plugin for the open source space exploration game, Endless Sky.

The intention is to provide an alternative means for a player to earn money and a way of punishing players who get too much into debt.

This first release has a very quick and dirty ship to be used as a Bailiff ship.  

Further changes to be implemented...

Some way of getting the Bailiff licence (I'll be testing the Bailiff ship first to refit with human outfits first)

Some way of getting Bailiff to chase impoverished players.

Also adds a shipyard to Trinket which sells bare-bones Furies, Sparrows, & Modified Argosies.

I'll make a full list of outfit loadouts up if there's enough interest. This is my first plugin, so I wasn't documenting as I went.

<blockquote>Semi-dead, though the dream is still alive! Expect very slow progress with occasional small additions.

Current to-do (loosely sorted by which are likely first):
- 1: Rework all existing ships to something that actually looks decent; see new Guardian and Warrior models.
- 2: Replace more placeholder outfits with my own (stealing effects and sounds for placeholder though).
- 3: Improve the map more (add more commodities, planets, descriptions etc. to make it feel more alive).
- 4: Add some basic jobs to give stuff to do.
- 5: More ships!
- 6: Some basic intro missions to give some lore to the player about what this strange alien civilisation is about.

Note: Some reasonably-solid lore points already exist, though with some story missions and descriptions more details will be made and revealed.

<blockquote># Kaynz

Kaynz is a plugin for [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io) which plans to add an entire story arc to the original game.

### Story arc description

The goal is to add an ulterior story arc to the main game, which puts it, as of the moment this is redacted, after the wanderer storyline.
The plugin will add a new galaxy to the game, with a new race: the Kaynz. They are intended to be a tier 4 alien race, capable of taking down Drak ships (with some difficulty however), a detail important to the lore.
The Kayn people are intended to be human-like, however slender, smaller, and with a pronounced blue skin. 
They will come in three main factions :
* The Kayn Empire: The original faction of the Kaynz, a stagnant empire in almost every way, yet still powerful
* The Kayn Republic: The first of the two factions separated from the Empire. They still maintain relationship with the Empire, but there clearly is tension between those two factions. They are ruled by an elected Senate, or they pretend it to be that way, and is thriving economicaly.
* The New Kaynz form the last main faction, which also seceded from the Empire. They are at war with both the Empire and the Republic, however there is not much fighting going on. They are ruled by a closed council, and are thriving on a military and a technological standpoint.
The storyline will involve a first contact between humans and kaynz, the future of their relationship and the conclusion of the Kayn internal conflict

### Current status

(what is done so far)
* essential specific outfits (engines, first weapons, power, shield, heat dissipation)
* first Kayn Republic ships (Honorbound and Dragonfly)
* some cargo ships (for merchants mainly)
* first contact questline (ongoing)
* most of the galaxy (including planets)
* lore introduction

### TODO list

Gameplaywise:
* more ships specific to the Kayn Republic (currently Honorbound and Dragonfly)
* ships specific to the New Kaynz
* ships specific to the Kayn Republic
* more civilian ships
* outfit balancing
* more specific outfits
* more jobs
* finalizing galaxy (New Kayn space to do particulary)
* wormhole stabilisation station sprites
* SPRITES! (Honorbound sprite is the only "not ugly" one so far)

Writingwise:
* entire New Kayn storyline (including siding with them (long term))
* entire Kayn Empire storyline (including siding with them (long term))
* continuation of the Kayn Republic storyline
* add more lore 
* fix the author's mandatory english mistakes

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># ES_Lampyrid_Start
Have you ever wanted to start Endless Sky flying something a bit more unique than the typical shuttle, starbarge, or sparrow? Have you dreamed of having a pilot that starts their career with an old ship they've been fixing up for the past few years? Well, Lampyrid Start does that. 

Choosing this starts has your pilot start their career flying a slightly modified version of the Lampyrid, which is a decent balanced transport/freighter with the capacity to be fairly fast compared to others of its class.

Be warned, however, that all is not peace, prosperity, and clear skies: Despite the tweak adding an anti-missile turret to the Lampyrid, it has sufficient cargo capacity to attract pirates on a semi-regular basis. Possibly even on your first launch. So you will have to be alert, and probably need to see about either upgrading your ship to be faster; or replacing the AM with a more intimidating turret.

So long as you can avoid the pirates, this will be an easier and faster start than the standard ones. The pirate risk can make it a little riskier and slightly more challenging, though. Just think of them as Reavers, and it'll be just like flying in the Firefly universe.

<blockquote># Mega Freight
 Content plugin for opensource game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19187937/176770486-96d0ba66-0464-4557-ab3b-ef5c43d44505.PNG)

Adds several ships for you and various factions to use adding more variety to the galaxy as well as universe progression releasing new ships and technologies dependent and independent of storyline (mostly just human space for now).
* Faction with new ships: Merchant, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, Hai, Wanderer

Summary of what this plugin adds:

Over 50 ships:
* 50+ Freighters including specialized cargo ships (Fuel, LNG, Chemical, etc.) + 2 Superheavy
* 4 Transports
* 3 Space Liner
* 10+ Utility (Carriers, miners, etc.)
* 17+ Warships + 2 Superheavy (Purpose-built and modification of existing.)
* 1 Battlestation
* 9 Fighters, Drones, and other carried ships (Utility and Combat)

And other things:
* A few weapons and outfits. 
* Special jobs that gets expanded with appropriate ship (Mining, Gas shipping, Chemical shipping, Heavy lift/Crane, Cars, etc.)
* Additional luxury jobs/rich passengers depending on outfits.
* Huge jobs (Passengers, Deliveries, Escorts).
* Just a lot more jobs which are often location-specific. Planet that mines radioactive things export more of that. Leading electronics manufacturer export more of advanced electronics. etc. (WIP)
* New sub-factions often with unique variants, weapons, or even ships (Espion Mining, Rangphenn, Ugyr, Jack's, Rakin, Black Death, Crossguard, Sulso, Maryhal, NGK, Core Food, Core Nuclear, Solacer, Luna Winery).
* NPC fleets using the new ships.
* Persistent NPC (Battlestations in 3 systems, 2 of which can respawn after some time.)
* Additional ship spawn for some story missions.
* Orbital shipyard orbiting Mars after main plot.
* A few stations (Nordlin, Ankulah, Yokosuka, GS1 Galaxy, Ourea, Forge, Ankaim, Titanite)
* Gradual progression of the universe both dependent and independent of story missions. 
  * Stronger pirate fleet over time and merchants upgrading their weapons to keep up. 
  * New ships and technologies (timed and/or locked behind story missions)
  * Factions constructing new stations.
  * Limited time events that will be resolved by governments after a while.

Requires Unstable Build/0.10.3 or above.

# Recommended 

To fully utilize mining/utility fighters and drones provided with this plugin you can try Sam's Mining Complete fork of the game which allows you ~~command your ships to target mineable asteroids~~(In vanilla now) and distribute fuel among your fleet with fighters. The fork also provides other gameplay improvements and bug fixes.

Pirate Mod. Starbridge (not actually in the original EVN)
Rebel Starbridge
Railbridge (Mod Stabridge with wingtip blasters replaced by railguns) (Civilian/Pirate/Rebel/Forbidden variants)

The Civilian Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Modified Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.

# Installation

(From the Endless Sky Wiki)
https://endless-sky.fandom.com/wiki/Mods

Installing mods is simple: place the folder containing the mod files in a folder labeled "plugins" in one of the following locations, depending on your operating system.
Linux

    /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
    ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

Windows

    plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
    C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

Mac OS X

    Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
    ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

The end result should be something like [file-path]\endless-sky\plugins\[plugin-name], which in turn will contain that specific mod's data, images, and sounds folders, and possibly readme and copyright info.

>End-game flagship with *jazz hands* modularity! 

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># The Peacebringer
Plugin for Endless Sky
WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

  "The Peacebringer is a one of a kind ship, commissioned not for sport, nor in exchange for money, or any other material offering that could conceivably produce any standard spacecraft into reality, but instead as a reparation to a remarkable individual who has woven together the failing strings of the galaxy with their bare hands; a gift to one who has saved humanity one or more times from an otherwise hopeless drive to extinction. It is tribute, to ensure that this individual, whomever they may be, can continue their extraordinary drive to keep the universe together.
  I guess you could also just... y'know, buy it from the Omnis shipyard, but that's kind of mean."
~ shipyard description

The Peacebringer is (going to be) a near end-game flagship "rewarded" to the player immediately after the (spoilers!) Kor Sestor missions involving their breach of human space. Well, when I say "rewarded", I mean that they're going to be sent across the galaxy on a wild goose chase for the most advanced technologies that each species has to offer in order to build, piece by piece, the most powerful starship that humanity has ever witnessed. A culmination of all creations advanced and arcane combined together into an unmatched set of speed, firepower, stealth, and modularity, the Peacebringer is kind of like a mini Heron but has a bunch of different alien technologies instead of just stuff from the Remnant.

To-do, generally:
- find appropriate, somewhat lore-friendly way to introduce
- model ship, and custom outfits (if any)
- outfit the ship
- create gathering missions
- snort ringworld shavings

>Adds some missions for the pirate worlds.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Arrr, Mateys!

## What is it?

A bunch of missions and stuff to give folks something to actually *do* on the pirate worlds in [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io).  Many of these things actually have an impact on pirate opinions, giving players a proper "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" option.

## What sorts of fun things can I do?

### Which ones are already implemented?

* Smuggle illicit substances (namely: drugs) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle illicit multimedia (namely: pirated software/videos/music) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle counterfeit goods out of pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the near future?

* Smuggle illegal immigrants out of pirate worlds
* Transport isolationists to pirate worlds
* Deliver medical supplies / luxury goods / etc. to pirate worlds
* Smuggle slaves into / out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle weapons into pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the not-so-near future?

* Some pirate-centric mini-storylines (or perhaps a Pirate-centric main storyline)
* A pirate-centric alternate start (probably part of the above)

## What's the license?

GPLv3 (see `COPYING`).

<blockquote># A Coalition at War

You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg in Endless Sky, but you never see it. This plugin introduces a storyline that lets you see or join that conflict. You gain access to Quarg or Heliarch tech and warships depending on the side you choose.

You can start the first mission by landing on "Tebuteb's Table" (in the Tebuteb system) or Forpelog (in the Sadalsuud system) and accepting the anomaly mission.

This plugin is best enjoyed after finishing the Wanderer Campaign. Getting access to Tier 3 tech makes everything else basically irrelevant.

There's few missions right now. See "Contributing" below if you have any ideas for more missions.

# Getting Started

## Installing

1. Download the plugin here: [https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases](https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases)

2. Put the zip file in your plugins folder:

Windows: `%APPDATA%\endless-sky\plugins/`

Mac: `~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins/`

Linux: `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

3. Decompress/"Unzip" the zip file.
4. Start Endless Sky. You should be able to see "A Coalition at War" under Preferences > Plugins.
5. If you have problems, open an issue: https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/issues/new/choose

## Using

Land on Tebuteb's Table or Forpelog and you will be asked to investigate an anomaly. Accept the mission and you'll be on your way.

<blockquote># Enigma Corp
Enigma Corp is an ever expanding mod that takes you through the adventures of the Enigma Corporation, a strange and greedy corporation that has only just recently surfaced onto the open market and is already doing big things. Both an outfit development and ship creation company, the Corporation has taken the market by storm, introducing new and exciting things to the general public that have never been seen before.

Although, some say that Enigma Corp's rise to power was not done cleanly, claiming that they steal secrets from other companies in order to gain an unfair edgy on their competitors. And rumor has it that they have dark connections with alien races, allowing them to develop the amazing things that they do that recently seemed out of humanity's grasps. But are these rumors true? Only you can find out!

Enjoy playing with dozens of new outfits and multiple new ships, as well as exploring the over 40 new systems that this mod adds in the Milky Way alone. That's right! There's more than just the Milky Way in this mod! Where will your travels take you? Find out today!

Plugin for Endless Sky https://endless-sky.github.io/

This plug-in adds additional cargo and passenger (and both at once) missions to the game increasing the scale and scope for a player who wants to focus on running a huge trucker shipping delivery passenger service.

Please check "Releases" for functional releases - whatever is currently in source may be a work in progress. I release code when it is in a stable, tested state so check there!

-=-=-=-
Fluff
-=-=-=-

Alright you gear-jamming hyperspace truckers, this message is brought to you by your good ol' boys at Meganthium Trucking Company, THE Mega Truck Co. Find yourself doing a lot of shopping and price comparison trying to fill up all that cargo space? Maybe you've found gravy town and got yourself a little convoy and are ready to move up to the big leagues? Well we at Mega Truck Co. have you covered. Bigger jobs for a big galaxy. Get your cargo and passenger space up high enough and you'll start getting bigger and larger jobs with more bonus payout. With around fifty billion humans making and taking, it has never been a better time to be a trucker, hauler, ferry, or cabby. 

Why not go into the big leagues and find yourself some truely EPIC deliveries to fulfill? These special missions come co-sponsored by yours truely, Max Hammer, CEO, Mega Truck Co. These enormous, mega, and epic missions are all high-risk. You'll run into corporations looking to get even or just level the competition. You might even get targetted by the biggest and bravest pirates around who want to steal all that cargo. You aren't just hauling big volume; I need you to keep that cargo safe!

-=-=-=-
Features:
-=-=-=-

Additional jobs which become unlocked with higher cargo and passenger count. These are copies of the vanilla jobs with a few tweaks to both increase minimums and push the maximum sizes way up - and also their default bonuses. After all, hiring you to do it in one saves them on logistics. There are also more jobs for moving criminals (needs the brig) and more for wealthy patrons (needs luxury) and added one or two fun little but high payout jobs such as a wealthy enthusiast who wants to brag about having gotten a ride with such a legendary captain! (Requires high net-worth)

Right now these extra jobs should come into a vanilla campaign over time as you grow your fleet, either with many haulers or just a couple huge rigs. Most of these jobs are slightly more rare to cut down on job-overload. For now though, once you're an epic trucker you will see nearly 50% more jobs each day.

*Existing Compatible*
This can be safely added or removed from an existing game. I've tested this myself on Windows and Ubuntu (Linux) only. When adding, you won't see new jobs until you land again (if you're already landed it won't prompt to check for new jobs until you take off). If you remove it, you will keep whatever jobs you have as they're part of your save file -- you will just stop seeing these jobs (again, only once you take off). 

*Mod Compatible*
This should work with any other mods because this only adds jobs and does not try to tweak existing stuff. 
Once we add any overrides to phase out vanilla shipping, however, this will become more complicated. This isn't implemented yet.

-=-=-=-
Installation Instructions: 
-=-=-=-

Download the ZIP file and extract it into your plugins folder. 
Alternately, you can just git clone directly into the plugins folder
Make sure you are only one folder with the name of the mod which directly contains the "data" folder - if you're two levels deep the plugin loader wont find and load the plugin.

You'll know it is working if you have over 200 cargo or 6 passengers and you see missions with "Bigger" "Larger" "Many" "A Big Family" and similar things in their name

-=-=-=-
Future:
-=-=-=-

* Override for existing main jobs to phase them out over time as your cargo + passengers + net worth go up. 
* Add 3rd tier of mega jobs and have them phase in over time as the big ones also phase out. No one wants to be cluttered with "deliver 5 tons" when you're doing "deliver 2200 tons" and the job system can get overloaded and noisy.
* More jobs for cargo + passengers from special regions, like corporate retreat for 200+ people, or help setup a colony 1000tons and 100 people
* High Risk job line which requires certain net worth and combat rating on top of cargo and passenger which involves turbo pirate and later, ELITE enemies
* Deep, Syndicate, and FW specific jobs
* Eliminating Large Industry Transport Executives - ELITE Pirate force as special antagonists using large pools of vessels including checking for modded ones to be the antagonists for EPIC jobs
* Mega Truck Co. HQ with special mission line and some cute custom loadouts for basic haulers, freighters, etc as well as the atomic fusion bactrian "MEGA TRUCK" rig just for fun, nothing game breaking nor outside of vanilla game
* Extra banter from merchants and major factions once you've completed EPIC or MEGA jobs which allows setting to appear to be aware you are a truely epic trucker

<blockquote># Notice: 2023-06-27

I don't play Endless Sky very much anymore. I used to maintain this plugin because it was fun. But now I realize the many issues it has; such as the inherent implausibility of the factions such as the CSSF and Sayari Plushie Authority; the space LEEST uses for systems being taken up by new pull requests. It was great by 2021 standards for me, but in the two years since I have improved at an exponential rate and moved away from Endless Sky.

If I ever returned to Endless Sky and wanted to make plugins; it is likely I would start from scratch and call it LEEST 2.

- Lemuria

## Download
* If on GitHub, scroll up and click that big green `Code` button and download the zip file.

### Windows
* Copy the Lemurias-Extra-ES-Stuff-main.zip file into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins`.
* Unzip the file.
* Remove the Lemurias-Extra-ES-Stuff-main.zip, if you want to.

### macOS
* Extract the zip to `/Users/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins`. Or `Application Support`, depending on your version.

## Sayari disclaimer

This Endless Sky plugin may contain traces of the Hai ambassador "Sayari". Exposure to Sayari may result in the following effects: Simping, being targeted by Yuyuko Saigyouji, being killed by Yuyuko Saigyouji, insomnia due to thinking about Sayari and Endless Sky constantly at night, gaming addiction.

Additional effects include a cease and desist letter from anti-gaming groups (rare), and for developers, overload of any MongoDB databases, bill shock if GitHub autopay is on and price is based upon your use of storage and computing power, being denied access to APIs and web services due to storing excessive photos of Sayari, writing too much code that keeps track of Sayari, sending too many requests for a search for Sayari, and excessive posting of Sayari images to aforementioned web services (Stack Overflow, Discord, animal forums, r/aww, r/squirrel, subreddits related to squirrels) respectively.

<blockquote># navy-conscript

This is a work in progress plug-in that will provide the player a choice to join The Republic Navy instead of The Free Worlds Militia.

So far only the core events, and some other components have been added. There are very few missions at this point in time and the Plug-in does not have parity with the Militia main quest.

# Contributors wanted!

**Story Line Needed**

I envisioned three rank tier's for conscript. The Tier's consist of:

**Tier I** starts off collecting surveillance and fights pirates in the north. The Lore here has an emphasis on capturing ships and assisting damaged navy ships. This initial phase is to help the player build up their fleet. Tier I then moves to collecting surveillance in the south discovering the moon where the nuclear tests were performed which earns rank of Tier II.

**Tier II** Tier II is war in the south. It will involve capturing systems, destroying some southern pirates that are plundering border republic worlds. This tier will also have the Alpha attack.

**Tier III** Tier III will be the Syndicate investigation and the Pug Invasion.

I want to keep tier II and tier III story lines lined up with the main story but of course they will be from the perspective of The Republic/Navy and of course the navy will win.

<details>

<blockquote># pirate-planets
## A mod with a new start and storyline for endless-sky

The pirate worlds have always been an essential part of the Republic,
necessary and despised at the same time. They take the pressure off
inner-world jails by providing a place for scoundrels and
ne'er-do-wells to flee, and they provide a convenient place for
wealthy, inner-world aristos to conduct less-than-legal
business. Savvy operators in the Pirate worlds have understood that
this was their role since before the Republic even existed, and have
always been sure to offer a quiet marketplace where law-abiding
citizen can buy drugs, slaves, and other things their neighbors
wouldn't approve of. In return, these Pirate world operators, half
crime-lord and half medieval warlord, can rest secure in the knowledge
that they are too useful to the Paradise worlds to ever face any
serious attempt to bring them to justice.

It's a win-win scenario - for everyone but the people of the Pirate
worlds.  Theirs is a life of hard labor and a precarious existence,
where the will of the local Warlord is absolute.

In this mod you start as a member of a poor farming community on one
of the Pirate worlds. Your village has just been massacred by a rogue
band of pirate raiders, yet you have managed to steal one of their
ships and escape. You have a chance to seek justice, wealth, or
perhaps bring true political change to the Pirate worlds.

## Notice

This is a work in progress, and is not necessarily fully playable
yet. Install it at your own risk.

>SpaceCrate adds planet X-283N1 in the Alpha Centauri system. A rapidly developing world obsessed with trade and exports. Ship workers and raw materials in bulk to the planet. Export everything they produce.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>

---THANKS FOR TRYING SPACECRATE A SILLY BUT SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO ADD CONTENT TO ENDLESS SKY!---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- WHAT TO EXPECT FROM SPACECRATE

SpaceCrate is a trade mod focused on lucrative deals from a trade planet perspective.
In Alpha Centauri you'll find a rich planet called X-283N1 whose people are obsessed with
trade and exports. An implied silly 'narrative' exists appointing Arnan (me) as its CEO
running the place. The people on X-283N1 love trade and exports so much that they have no
time for petty politics. All they want is to ship stuff to the galaxy. And they're willing
to pay.

Their obsession with exports requires a lot of imports as well. Notably raw materials. You
will find Bulk Deliveries aimed at X-283N1 throughout many systems, as well as prospecting
passengers who want to travel to the planet to find a new career. This in turn results in
shipments of all sizes being ready for export. Higher paying and more challenging jobs are
unlocked as your reputation and combat rating goes up.

You gain reputation with SpaceCrate Inc. by doing jobs and to some extend killing pirates.
Once your reputation is sufficiently high CEO Arnan sends out a recruiter to give you a job
with a salary through a basic story line. Completing the story line successfully will
unlock employee missions, which are larger and riskier jobs normally reserved for the inner
circle of SpaceCrate.

Other than a few illicit jobs you will not find fighting missions or other combat related
activities in this plugin as that is not what this mod is for. Instead the mod relies on
already available mechanics to create a (pirate) threat for your growing merchant fleet.
The planet does have a sizable defense force that will attack you like a bunch of mad
pirates should you contest the planet. Some jobs require a combat rating to be offered.

You'll see CEO Arnan fly in and around Alpha Centauri in his ship 'StarGoose' encouraging
you to visit his planet and make some money. Regular trade fleets can be seen flying near
Alpha Centauri sometimes with witty remarks or hints about the various jobs and perks
SpaceCrate has to offer.

SpaceCrate is a bit of an experiment with how the plugin system works.

Post your experience on the repo: https://github.com/adegans/SpaceCrate/discussions

- BALANCING

If you find any balancing issues, for example ridiculous rewards or shipments that never fit

<blockquote># Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky, v0.2

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

## Current status

Intro and part 2/4 finished: Runs up almost to the point of the Free Worlds choice to side with the defector or Syndicate

- Plus the main side-plot for part I, and some side jobs

I've written the story outline for the rest, up to the end of the civil war, but not written it into the game yet: that's To Be Continued.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky. You probably already know how. If not, let me know, and I'll get round to updating this readme with the instructions.

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the continuous build in the main Endless Sky project.

<blockquote># ES-Syndicate-Campaign
The development repository for the Syndicate campaign of Endless Sky. Spoilers ahead.

### What's this exta stuff folder?
I'm keeping my workflow public for anyone to check out and comment on. This folder contains all the things I'm using to help create the campaign, from Blender files of any new models to text files containing any work for the development process. Given the nature of my workflow, this will be a mix of new and old stuff, some (maybe even most) of which that may not make any sense whatsoever and may never be used. It can also get rather unorganized. Below is a description of the text files in the extra stuff folder, but just take everything you see in these files with a grain of salt as none of it is set in stone.

* everything syndicate.txt: a file containing every reference to the Syndicate in the game.
* syndicate info.txt: a distilled, summarized version of the above file.
* character sheet.txt: a file containing info on all the characters new and old that are part of the Syndicate.
* syndicate notes.txt: a file of random notes that I've taken during the development of the campaign.
* rough storyboard.txt: a file that contains a VERY rough (WIP) storyboard of how things will go. More polished storyboards will be located in the data folder once I'm actually about to start writing that part.

<blockquote># Crisis in Management, a Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky

v0.9

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

> Leave your failing company and take to the stars to escape repercussions, then find yourself in the background, behind the scenes of Endless Sky's main storyline.  
> Beyond that, the same, endless, sky awaits.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky, or install with ESLauncher2 (available there soon I hope).

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the most recent release. If perchance you're playing this in the future and it doesn't work any more, please let me know and I'll try to fix it for current release.

## Current status

Approximately complete. There are a few things I want to improve sometime (feel free to help speed that up by telling me how much you loved... or hated but want to love, the plugin). For that and for bug reports you can open an issue or discussion on Github, or dig through the files to find my email address.

## Contribution and Copying

Many thanks to everyone at Endless Sky, without whom this wouldn't make a lot of sense, and would never have happened. Special thanks to samrocketman who gave advice on tidying up the licence and things.

Images are thanks to Michael Zahniser and Becca Tommaso (see copyright file).

The text of this I release into the public domain. While, if you publish an altered version of this story I'd appreciate if you let me know or even ask me first; but I place no legal restrictions on this and have waived my copyright.

<blockquote># I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods
Includes the ships, missions, and outfits I have or will create. Features unique and original endless sky ideas and original assets created by me.

Please note that as of this time I do not consider this mod pack ready for public use. By using this mod you are automatically a Beta tester. This mod may break your game save, not function as expected, or destroy the universe... who knows.

My ships:

![Captured Archon](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/archborg.png?raw=true)

An Archon captured by the syndicate and fitten with control devices and modified weaponery. Fortunatly the syndicate was unable to access the most powerful of the Drak weaponery but this is still a fearsome weapon in the wrong hands.

![Tazership](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/tazership-img.png?raw=true)

This ship, originally created to explot a vulnurability in a malfunctioning Korath ship, is fitted with a powerful electrical arc weapon which bypasses shields entirely and does massive amounts of damage.


![Impaler](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/dart-img.png?raw=true)

Inspired by the yaka arrow from guardians of the galaxy, this drone ship is capable of instantly destroying nearly every ship in the game. It also has a tracer effect similar to the one in the movies.


![Sol Invictus](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/Sol%20Invictus-img.png?raw=true)

Sol Invictus, a ship with a blue dwarf at it heart providing nearly unlimited energy along with thrust and a flame thrower like weapon.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>## Intent:

Performing the below actions should result in a working directory `<work_dir>` which will permit the map editor and game to both correctly load the plugin while still keeping the plugin repository safely seperated from the root game data.

### Assumptions:
   - The repo was simply cloned to `%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory`
   - that steam is installed to the default location `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam`
   - that Endless Sky is installed to the default install location set by steam (`<steam_dir>\steamapps\common\...`)

### Commands:
```
cd <work_dir>
mklink /J data "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory\data"
mklink /J images "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Sky\images"
mklink /J repo "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory"

cd "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Sky\images"
mklink es_et "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory\images\es_et"
```

When opening in the map editor, please open files by way of the `<work_dir>\data` directory tree.

This is a plugin aiming to provide music for Endless Sky as well as remaster the
audio to balance it.

# Audio conversion

Endless Sky is extremely specific about how it supports audio.  Currently, only
WAV for sound effects and MP3 for music is supported.

### Encoding sound effects

Sound effects are in WAV format.  Specifically, little-endian 16-bit PCM at
44100 Hz.

Here's an `ffmpeg` command to get sounds into an appropriate format.

    ffmpeg -i original.wav -ac 1 -f wav -c pcm_s16le -ab 705k -ar 44100 sounds/effect.wav

### Encoding music

MP3 specifically requires stereo format (2-channel) bit rate 179kb/s at 44100
Hz.

    ffmpeg -i original.wav -f mp3 -ar 44100 -ab 179k -ac 2 sounds/music.mp3
