The Space things mod implements many space themed ships, planets, etc. into the game. Of course some continuity errors 
will arise, mostly because i have to change the story to fit into the Endless Sky world. More updates will come, 
however i can't guarantee consistanty in updates. I hope you enjoy! (There might be some easter eggs in the Pirate systems,
just be patient and you'll see. :)

P.S., if there are any bugs or suggestions, don't be shy in leaving them in the comments. I will try to
read and/or respond to your comments. (Any suggestion implemented into the game will have their name 
added to the WALL OF HELPFULLNESS)

NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I need some help from YOU! If you have any idea as to how to make missions in Endless Sky, please contact me. This is the next step in making the Space Things mod even
better and more immersive.
