# navy-conscript

This is a work in progress plug-in that will provide the player a choice to join The Republic Navy instead of The Free Worlds Militia.

So far only the core events, and some other components have been added. There are very few missions at this point in time and the Plug-in does not have parity with the Militia main quest.

**Story Line Needed**

I envisioned three rank tier's for conscript. The Tier's consist of:

**Tier I** starts off collecting surveillance and fights pirates in the north. The Lore here has an emphasis on capturing ships and assisting damaged navy ships. This initial phase is to help the player build up their fleet. Tier I then moves to collecting surveillance in the south discovering the moon where the nuclear tests were performed which earns rank of Tier II.

**Tier II** Tier II is war in the south. It will involve capturing systems, destroying some southern pirates that are plundering border republic worlds. This tier will also have the Alpha attack.

**Tier III** Tier III will be the Syndicate investigation and the Pug Invasion.

I want to keep tier II and tier III story lines lined up with the main story but of course they will be from the perspective of The Republic/Navy and of course the navy will win.
