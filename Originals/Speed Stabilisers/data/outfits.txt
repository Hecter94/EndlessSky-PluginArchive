	description "This mechanism was created as a device to stabilize the speed of Heavy and Super-Heavy Warships. The engines sometimes create so much thrust that the speed becomes absurdly difficult to control at longer burns, so this front vent was connected to the engine to allow for a small amount of thrust. This outfit's sole purpose is to lower the maximum speed of long burns."
