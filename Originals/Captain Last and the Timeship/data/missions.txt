			`	Bryant stands from his station suddenly with an alarmed look on his face,`

			`	"So, I think we might have an answer to the Galleons patroling the system.  One of the problems that we were encountering while completing the drive was that the process of sending tachyons through time creates a tremendous amount of waste energy.  While we had solved this problem by creating a unit to discharge the energy harmlessly, it would be possible to channel the energy through the main tachyon guiderod and use it as a weapon.
