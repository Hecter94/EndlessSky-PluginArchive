conversation "intro"

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming durasteel. A doorman stands by each of the heavy transparisteel doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large holomonitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Fondor. Alsakan. Coruscant.`
	`	The holopen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of the datapad and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a tall-headed middle-aged Muun in a suit that you suspect costs more than the starship you are about to purchase, slides the pages on the holopad quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 100,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 4.2%, which means that your daily payments are 4,200 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 1,545,600 credits in interest. Better pay us back quickly. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The turbolift is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer starships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and tibanna gas; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

conversation "flight check: no energy!"
	scene "scene/engine2"
	`You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of the <ship> warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	`	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up your systems for a test run... and you discover that your generator does not produce enough power to power them. You'll have to either install some batteries, or switch to a more powerful generator.`	
	
conversation "flight check: no thruster!"
	scene "scene/engine2"

	`	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!`

conversation "flight check: overheating!"
	scene "scene/engine"

As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of the <ship> warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check.`
	`	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`
