			`A voice says, "This system is off limits. You should leave."`
			`	After a second, you realize that the voice did not come from your communications equipment. In fact, now that you think about it, you're not sure if it was an audible voice, or just something in your head.`
			choice
				`	(Ignore it.)`
				`	"Why should I leave?"`
					goto why
				`	"You can't tell me what to do."`
					goto why
			`	"You should leave." The thought repeats itself, insistently. Either you're going crazy, or a creature is communicating with you telepathically.`
			choice
				`	"Why should I leave?"`
				`	"You can't tell me what to do."`
			label why
			`	You feel as if a vast and patient creature has just heaved an immense sigh. "Human, you would do well not to ignore my warning. I am here to warn off those who might be harmed by Yuuzhan'tar's children. If you remain here long your ship will be destroyed by the Yuuzhan Vong."`
			`	You see organic ships in front of you, above a lone planet.`
			choice
				`	"Get destroyed by what, you and those other things above the planet?"`
				`	"What is a 'Yuuzhan'tar'?"`
					goto swarm
			`	"I am the planet. My name is Zonama Sekot, I am the seed of the former homeworld of the Yuuzhan Vong, Yuuzhan'tar." There is something strange about the planet, there is no star to light it up, yet you see its surface. On top of that, there is greenery. How is this possible? A living planet?`
			`	"What are these creatures above the planet? What is Yuuzhan'tar?" you ask.`
			label swarm
			`	"Those creatures are living ships used by the Yuuzhan Vong. Yuuzhan'tar is their former homeworld, which was destroyed in a distant galaxy long ago. I am the seed of their world, a living planet. I am called Zonoma Sekot." You cannot believe what is happening. A planet is talking to you in your head! This must be a dream or something. I knew I shouldn't have come to the unknown regions.`
			choice
				`	"Okay, okay, I'll get out of here."`
					goto end
				`	"Wait, I have more questions."`
			`	"Yes?"`
			`	You ask, "Why don't you just destroy the Yuuzhan Vong, if they are so dangerous?"`
			`	The voice says, "I do not posess that power, and even if I did I would not destroy the children of Yuuzhan'tar. Besides, I feel Yuuzhan'tar has punished them enough by completely cutting them off from the Force."`
			`	You notice the organic ship things turning towards you.`
			choice
				`	"Well, it's an honor to meet you. I'll be leaving now."`
					goto end
				`	"Why do you care if they go extinct?"`
			`	"They are all that is left of my galaxy, and I am all that is left of their world. I feel that our fates are intertwined. Now go!"`
			label end
			`	The presence inside your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air.`
