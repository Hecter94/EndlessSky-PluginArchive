The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in Galactic history, until the rise of the Sith.`
			`Each planet gets 1 to 3 representatives who share one spot in the Galactic Senate. Theoretically, all member worlds of the Galactic Republic get equal representation in the senate, regardless of their population or wealth. In reality the corporate lobbyists and bureaucrats have more power in decision making, and are more likely to listen to rich core worlds than what they perceive to be irrelevant outer rim territories.`
		log "Factions" "InterGalactic Banking Clan" `The InterGalactic Banking Clan is the largest banking and commerce organization in the Galaxy. It was founded a few decades before the creation of the Galactic Republic and has grown to be unrivalled, almost monopolizing the banking industry as a whole in the Galaxy. The Banking Clan owns a plethora of subsidiary companies in every industry in the Galaxy, making them the largest employer. Denizens who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Muun worlds in the Galactic North, where they can work in a variety of fields as well as in the Banking Clan itself. Although the Banking Clan's worlds are technically part of the Republic, the Clan rules over Muunilinst and its colonies, and controls the representation of every Muun world in the Senate. This gives the Banking Clan more power than any single system in the Galactic Republic.`
			`The InterGalactic Banking Clan is a pivotal part of the Galactic economy, but they are also well known for profiteering in wars against the Galactic Republic, having given loans to the Old Sith Empire and the current enemies of the Republic.`
		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In poorer and more remote star systems, at the edge or outside of the authority of one of the major powers, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds in the Outer Rim Territories.`

Its a rural planet with few people and little industry, away from all the noise that had filled James' life. You wonder if James will ever be able to settle down and enjoy the peaceful quietness of this world.`

	`	As you are piloting your ship down to land on <planet>, James disappears into his bunk room. After the ship has landed he comes out, no longer in the grease-stained coveralls he's been wearing up until now, but in a suit. As a lifelong textile worker, you automatically note that the suit is made of real nerf wool, very finely woven, and that it has been tailored to fit him. He smooths down the front of the suit distractedly and then looks at his hands as if unsure of where to put them. "How do I look?" he asks.`
