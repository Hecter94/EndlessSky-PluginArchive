	description "The Atgeir-class is an old battlecruiser design from the previous war between Alsakan and Coruscant. Alsakan ships are famous for being massive and for using crowns of dagger-like shield generators to generate a powerful shield bubble around the vessel. This ship is now mostly used for home defense, as it is very expensive and not as worthwhile as smaller, nimbler warships."

	description "Taerab Starship Manufacturing's BSX-5 Dreadnaught is built on a smaller version of the Harrower frame. Though smaller, in a lot of ways this starship is an upgrade over the monstrous Sith Dreadnought. The BSX-5 is cheaper, faster, more maneuvarable and has better anti-missile defences than its big cousin. The BSX-5 acts as a great escort to the raw firepower of the Harrower, stopping missiles from hitting the Capital ship."

	description "Corellia StarDrive's Thranta-class corvette is the successor to the old Praetorian-class frigate and the Hammerhead-class cruiser. The Thranta is the workhorse of the Republic Navy, having production numbers that more than rival that of the Hammerhead-class. Though this corvette does not have the firepower to go head to head against a Harrower without aid, it is powerful enough to compete with the Terminus-class destroyer of the Sith Empire."
