		description `New Asgard is a relatively small moon, although despite this it is still able to hold onto a thick, breathable atmosphere. Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide.`
		description `	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses.`

		description `New Scotland is a world consisting of scrubland and low mountain ranges, for the most part; it is an old world, where tectonic activity is beginning to die down. As a result of the decrease in tectonic activity, the planet's magnetoshpere is also slowly weakening. This in turn increases the amount of radiation falling on the surface, making the inhabitants much more likely to develop cancerous growths as they age.`
		description `	Although this world is currently being occupied by the Kaltheim, you cannot actually see any signs of them in person; the only signs of their activities are the smoking remains of ships crashed into the deserts, and the frequent patrols that fly overhead.`
	planet Gahr'wregdl'iahr
		description `This is a world of near-unbearable heat. As day turns to night, oceans emerge in the sunlit deserts, and as night turns to day, billions of cubic metres of liquid evaporate into the grim, foreboding clouds above.`
		description `	Gahr'wregdl'iahr is, seemingly, a heavily militarized world. Nearly every facility you see is in some way optimized to contribute to a galactic war effort, with either orbital defense systems in place, heavy-duty planetary shielding, or vast strips of abandoned tarmac landing pads designed for enormous armadas of ships.`

As a result, much of the terrain is tough and mountainous- perfectly suited to the dwarves of fantasy legend.`
		description `	While Bilbo was not hit as hard as its mother planet by the Kaltheim attack, it will still take a long while for the ecosystems to recover.`
	planet "Memorandum"
		description `Memorandum is a very "normal" world. The climate is stable and fairly warm, and days are similar to those on Earth.

XSZ's largest shipyards were once located here, meaning thousands of people migrated here each year to fill the massive number of jobs required to work in the shipyards, as well as the mines.`
		description `	While you hear Storm Crow Industries has plans to salvage some of XSZ's old designs and convert the shipyards here into a new complex for manufacturing their own ships, nothing has happened as of yet. As a result, many families are out of work, with grumblings of discontent common among the populace.`

As a result, while it has not been decimated as completely as Carmine was- especially in the shipbuilding areas- the environment on Alleshafen will continue to be in a dire state thanks to the radiation from the nuclear blasts until well after you are dead.`
		spaceport `	The nuclear attacks on Alleshafen, and the successive pirate occupation have led to a sudden surge of emigration to other planets. The year-long nuclear winters, widespread destruction of infrastructure, and irradiated environment have suddenly made Alleshafen an undesirable place to live. Consequently, the remains of the spaceport are bursting with refugees, looking for a way to get off-world.`

		description `New Boston is a completely unremarkable world... except, of course, for the fact that you happen to have been born here. Most of the land is wet and marshy, and the coastal regions are prone to flooding. Some food crops are grown here, but most of the farmers instead plant flax and jute, which grow well in wet soil and are used to make linen and burlap cloth. The textile mills are hot and poorly ventilated, but they offer higher and more reliable income than farming.`
		description `With your status as savior of the republic, many tourists come here to see the world that produced a modern day hero.`
		spaceport `Some day New Boston may be a prosperous enough planet to afford a better spaceport, but not yet. Many of the concrete landing pads have sunk into the muddy soil over the years since they were poured, and are now tilted and uneven. The market where ship captains buy and sell cargo is a large tent rather than a permanent building, but it is sturdy enough to keep off the rain, and high enough for loads to be brought in and out by trucks and the occasional hovercraft. And, some enterprising local mechanics have set up not only a repair shop and outfitter, but also a shipyard with several small, refurbished ships for sale.`
		spaceport `The old spaceport is being tested nowadays thanks to the dozens of tourist craft that are constantly arriving. You notice that many of the tourists seem unwilling to take the slog outside the spaceport, as most seem to just take a few pictures and then quickly leave. There is even a small gift stand selling items with a low quality image of your face on them, it is a strange sight to see as someone who grew up in poverty.`

		spaceport `The old spaceport has been forced to expand with the ridiculous amount of tourists that arrive every minute, with the original concrete slabs refurbished and entirely new landing pads installed. An entirely new road has been paved to the nearest city and an entire shopping mall seems to have sprung up outside the spaceport overnight with the main theme being YOU. You struggle to move through the crowds since as soon as someone recognises you all you hear is a scream and you are flooded with adoring fans, if you ever wanted to be a celebrity, you have achieved it with flying colours.`
