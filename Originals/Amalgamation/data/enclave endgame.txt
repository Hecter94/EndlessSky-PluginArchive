				`	Go and find someone for orders.`
			`	After some searching, you discover Admiral Kuznetsov overseeing repairs to an extremely heavily modified Destroyer- presumably his flagship.`
			`	"Go get your ship repaired," Kuznetsov snaps without looking at you. "We're off to retake Seminar in the morning, the aliens took it whilst we were in transit from Perihelion. You're in charge of four Destroyers." He waves over his shoulder to a group of bashed-up looking ships.`

				`	"It makes more sense; it gives us a clear path to Seminar."`
			`	"It's immediately next to one of the alien systems," Kuznetsov replies. "So as soon as we took it, they'd simply launch an assault to retake it. But retaking Seminar puts them in a weaker position, and from there we can strike back at New Scotland with the rest of the southern arm behind us."`

			`When your ship touches down, it is almost immediately swarmed by a large number of what appear to be cadets in the Enclave's navy, gasping and gawking at your ship, which, you think, must look incredibly alien to them in comparison to those built by the shipyards here in Enclave space. Steeling yourself for the ordeal, you head to step off your ship.`
			choice
				`	(Wave.)`
			`	You step off the gangplank and onto the landing pad, smiling and waving as if you were a rock star from the Paradise Worlds, like the members of There Might Be Riots. As you try to move through the crowd, attempting to not knock anyone over, a kid shoves past the others and tugs on your sleeve. "Hey, Commander <first>," he says excitedly. "Are we allowed to go on your ship whilst you're away?"`

				`	"Absolutely not."`

			`	"Yay!" he shouts, having almost immediately forgotten you in his excitement. Gesturing to what you assume must be some of his friends, he dashes off, heading up the gangway into the bowels of your ship.`

			`	Face suddenly going stony, the cadet stalks off, clearly angry with you.`

			`	A few minutes later, you arrive in the main area of the planet's garrison, the only area on Seminar where narcotics are actually banned. The planetary commander's office- which Admiral Kuznetsov has clearly requisitioned- is a large, airy room, with windows opening onto a small garden behind the garrison. You suspect that some or all of the flowers growing there are used in some way or another for recreational substances.`
			`	As you enter, the Admiral looks up from what he appears to be doing on the holoscreen. "Hello, Commander," he says, with an uncharacteristic tone of excitement in his voice. "Good job on the battle."`

				`	"Thank you, sir."`

			`	"They sent the plans during those massive nuclear strikes a few weeks ago, presumably as a last resort- it's got all of the data we need to start producing them on Jumblar," the Admiral continues, clearly excited about adding what appears to be such a tank-like ship to his forces.`
			choice
				`	"Looks like an impressive ship."`
					goto impressive
				`	"How are we going to get our hands on enough resources to build these, what with how we're kind of currently at war with XSZ?"`
			`	Kuznetsov sighs. "No idea," he says halfheartedly. "There were some plans to start a mining operation on Mein though since there were some very promising signs coming from some prospecting a pair of entrepreneurs were doing before the war began." He shakes his head, clearly bringing himself back into the moment. "Anyway, once the fleet's repaired and and you've brought some reinforcements here from Jumblar, we're going to aim to retake the Memus and Cispia systems; they were taken whilst we were flying here. Understood?"`
			choice
				`	"Understood."`

			`	Kuznetsov dismisses it with a slight snort. "Just some Destroyers." Returning to his holoscreen, he continues talking to you;`
