			`	One of them replies, "The person in charge of the Syndicate's military fleet that protects the Syndicate from pirates, Kal Taylor, died from some type of poisoning recently. The Syndicate hasn't disclosed what exactly it was, but my bet is that it was a murder preformed by those damn Alpha bastards in the south-east. Killing that guy could only help the pirates and the Alphas, and I doubt the pirates even have the mental capacity to think to poison someone, they're just a weak lot of idiots if you ask me."`

			`The minute you land, you can tell that something is wrong. While most people are going about their day, there are some people crowded in a bar looking at a screen of some sorts.`
			`Walking over to the crowd you see they are all huddled over a small television broadcasting news about something.`
			`You can hardly hear the news reporter talking over the sound of the crowd, but you could make out some bits and pieces; "Recenly there has - attack on the planet - in the Betelgeuse system - bomb exploded - Betelgeuse shipyard headquarters - seventeen casualties - despite attempts - culprits have not been found."`
