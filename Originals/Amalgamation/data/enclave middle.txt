After a long walk, which was obviously designed specifically to disorient you, you arrive at the most opulent of the towers, where you are greeted by a somewhat snooty-looking XSZ employee, wearing a slick suit.

			`	The process of a ceasefire being negotiated continues for an agonisingly long time, until eventually, the diplomats seem to have arrived at a deal: a two-week ceasefire to allow both sides to move their civilians out of harm's way. While you suspect that XSZ did not agree to this out of regard for human life- more in order to conserve their workforce- it is undoubtedly good.`

You load them on to your ship as fast as you can, aware that the time on the ceasefire is ticking, and take off as soon as possible.`

			choice
				`	Stop someone and ask what's going on.`

			`	"Lieutenant <last>," you hear as you step into the departures hall. Ahead of you is a small knot of officers around your own rank and above, including Cathy Bradford. The speaker appears to be a tall, grizzled Admiral- this, you presume, is Admiral Kuznetsov. "Where have you been?"`
			choice

"We have received intelligence that the Daia, Four, Aetrus and Gautus systems have developed new hyperspace links to an area south of our space," Kuznetsov continues. "Our few vessels which were in the systems at the time reported a large force, clearly alien, and clearly heavily armed, jumping in. As of now, we have lost contact with all systems beyond Innenheim.

			`	"That may be so, Lieutenant," Kuznetsov replies, "But we need to mobilise again. We're trapped between XSZ and these aliens, so unless we want to be squashed like so many insects, we need to move back to Jumblar. XSZ is no longer a priority; we need to defend our space against these interlopers. Any questions?"`
