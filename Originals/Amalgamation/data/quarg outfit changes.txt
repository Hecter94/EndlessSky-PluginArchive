	description "These hybrid thrusters were designed to require as few additional outfits for proper functionality as possible. An integrated generator provides slightly less energy than consumed by the thruster, with a capacitor array covering the gap."

	description "This hybrid steering was designed to require as few additional outfits as possible. The modifications give it the capacity to operate only slightly below peak performance with no additional hardware. As long as the capacitors are occasionally allowed to recharge it can operate indefinitely with no energy input."

	"flare sprite" "effect/medium graviton flare"
	description "The standard Quarg thruster trades power and space efficiency for a reversible thrusting system. This innovation allows Quarg ships an unprecedented level of maneuverability, if not speed. While most would consider the massive power usage crippling, the Quarg’s reactors are powerful enough to render energy a non-issue."

outfit "Medium Graviton Steering"
	description "The Quarg's Medium Graviton Steering is strangely ineffective for such a technologically advanced engine. The Quarg's focus on reversible thrusters and beam turrets has led to a peculair situation. The turning speed of most vessels is considered mostly irrelevant."

	"flare sprite" "effect/medium graviton flare"
	description "This massive graviton thruster, used only on the Quarg’s largest ships, sacrifices the signature reversible thruster technology for a massive increase in efficiency, allowing Quarg capitals to attain speeds that many would consider impressive in an interceptor."

	"turning heat" 25
	description "Where the Medium Graviton Steering falls short the Large excels. Energy consumption is still massive, but the steering assembly now has enough power to allow even the largest of Quarg ships to make effective use of fixed position guns and non-reversible thrusters."

	description "The Quarg Heavy Anti-Missile is merely two Quarg Anti-Missile’s linked together and attached to a single mount. It is used only on the largest of Quarg ships, which have the space needed for the massive assembly."

	description "The Quarg Etherbolt is their only known fixed gun. Believed to be related to Skylance technology, these bolts focus on disabling rather than damaging enemy vessels, although they are still quite capable of the latter."

	description "This specialized Quarg jump drive sacrifices mass and speed for greatly increased efficiency. It is used solely on their exploration vessels; recon and espionage ships use a more advanced version capable of high speed jumps."

	"shield energy" 1.125
	"cooling" 4.5
	description "When the Wardrake’s small frame proved unable to handle the thermal output of the newly designed hybrid propulsion systems, the Quarg were forced to innovate further. The result was an energy efficient shield generator powered in part by the vessel’s waste heat."

outfit "Nanotech Battery"
	thumbnail "outfit/nanotechbattery"
	"fuel capacity" 200
	description "These batteries use exotic miniaturization techniques to fit massive quantities of fuel and energy. The capacity of these wonders of miniaturization is such that many non-Quarg vessels could conceivably use a single one of these batteries in place of a reactor. The fact that most Quarg vessels install one of these devices in addition to an Antimatter Core is testament to the extreme energy costs of Quarg technology."

outfit "Antimatter Core"
	thumbnail "outfit/quarg antimatter core"
	"ramscoop" 10
	description "The Quarg Antimatter Core is the core of their technological doctrine. This highly heat and size efficient reactor fuels the energy-guzzling, but mass and thermal efficient, Quarg systems. Able to run for centuries without refueling, their only downside is the extreme cost and complexity of construction."
