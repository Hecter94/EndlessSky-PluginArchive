	description "The Apollo is the largest and most advanced warship developed by the Enclave so far, somewhere between the Cruisers and the Carriers of the Republic in terms of size. The Apollo is able to carry two fighters in its bays, usually Darts. Despite its size, the Apollo is fairly maneuverable, capable of matching many interceptors in combat."
	description "	The Apollo was named after the series of missions during the second half of the 20th century which allowed humanity to set foot on a stellar object other than Earth for the first time."

	description "The Caesennia is an incredibly odd warship- one of the most heavily armoured in Enclave space, and yet it is also one of the fastest. (And most power hungry.)"
	description "	The Caesennia was developed during the Enclave Civil War as a response to XSZ's alarming new nuclear arsenal- through some very clandestine contacts, the designers were able to get hold of some incredibly interesting metal which was used to plate the hull, resulting in the Caesennia's abnormally high hull strength."

Unusually it even has interference plating added, for those few captains who may be transporting slightly less legal commodities than the norm."
	description "	The Leatherback's name came about as a result of an XSZ executive watching an ancient, classic film from Earth, which featured enormous alien monsters invading the planet. One of these monsters was named Leatherback, and in a drunken haze, he decided to name this freighter after it."

	description "The Turbulence is a medium warship designed by XSZ to act as the primary flagships for their fleets."
	description "	As a result, although the Turbulence is available for sale to the public, it has been built with nuclear capabilities in mind, and as a result, XSZ has added a massive eight gun ports for nuclear missiles. Despite this, they do appear to have taken into consideration at least some of the needs of average ship-owners, adding two turret mounts for anti-missile systems."
	description "	The nuclear version of the Turbulence is not available to the public."

ship "Lance" "Enclave Lance"
	description "The Enclave's variant on the Lance was initially developed during the war against the Ascendancy, strangely mirroring the one used by the Republic Navy. However, the Enclave is now beginning to phase the Lance out, in favour of the more agile Dart."

ship "Scout" "Enclave Scout"
	description "The original Scouts were first brought to the Tyridium galaxy along with the first settlers, and the design has changed very little since."
	description "	Although these Scouts are a lot more rugged and battle-worn than those found in the Milky Way, they seem to be no different in the way they are outfitted."
