	description "Inspired by close contact with Void Sprites and the reinvigoration of xenobiology, these agile ships are designed to swim in the atmospheres of gas giants. Using revolutionary construction techniques that enable the hulls to flex under their own power, penguins can reshape their skin on the fly to adapt to their environment. Combined with prototypical nervous systems that approach self-awareness, these ships are the first that could be termed alive - if only by the loosest of definitions."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Penguin's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "The Peregrine is the first ship designed using the refined materials and techniques discovered in recently explored alien ruins. Unlike previous Remnant ships, the Peregrines are the first ships that can be said to be truly alive: While previous ships have been described as 'semi-organic' or 'resembling living creatures,' the Peregrine has what can only be termed a distributed nervous system combined with a self-aware mind on par with the brightest of the homeworld's avians."
	description "	Watching the Peregrine in the shipyard is a touch disconcerting, as it doesn't stay still. Sensor pods are in constant motion, and the control surfaces twitch on a regular basis. You get the strong impression of an animal that is eager to be on the move."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Peregrine's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description "A recent development to aid the Remnant in combating the Korath's fighters, a powerful interceptor capable of fighting evenly with most human light warships thanks to its inbuilt cloaking technology and semi-organic hull that is a staple of Remnant ships."
