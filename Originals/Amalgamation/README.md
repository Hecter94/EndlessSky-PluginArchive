# Amalgamation
A large collection of older plugins that have been edited and modified to work together with the newer versions of Endless Sky and be overall more balanced and lore friendly, along with many unique Amalgamation additions to fill out previous placeholders in these plugins.

The plugins included are: Shields Up, Enclave, Quarg Military Retaliation, ZRemnantX's ships, Tribute Plus, Space Conversion, Businessman, Inheritance ships, KorNewShips, Korath Automation Upgrade, Enigma Corps outfits, Cultures of the Southern Arm ships, Flamethrower Turret and The Machines are Taking Over.

General changes include: Adding a large number of ships into vanilla fleets all across the galaxy. Creating multiple new jobs, mercenaries, trade routes and missions to the game. Adding tons of new variants of ships to be used in many of the fleets that allow the new outfits in this plugin to be found naturally through gameplay. Changing the stats of a huge number of ships and outfits for balance and lore purposes. And finally overhauling all the fights in the main storylines to add more variance to the fleets you fight and to make it much harder to use the old stratagy of, "If we have enough ships, they will eventually run out of missiles to kill us with!"

Big thanks to BeccaBunny for the use of their sprites, allowing this plugin to have many unique ships and outfits.

To use this plugin fully, the latest release (9.9), Czartrak's Ship Pack plugin, Beccas expansion and the Adde plugin are needed. 

In addition to this the (Mission Overrides) folders files need to be moved into the "Endless Sky/data" folder and allowed to overright the files there for the campaigns to have the many ships this plugin adds included.

(Make sure to backup the overidden files otherwise only a reinstall will revert the game to the vanilla state!)
