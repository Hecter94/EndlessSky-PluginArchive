	description "This appears to be the Normandy's shielding array. Unlike human shield modules, this device predicts incoming enemy fire and redirects power to the respective area instantly instead of constantly feeding the whole matrix. This constant feedback makes sustaining enemy fire mostly a matter of energy supply."

	description "'Greetings! It seems that I got my promotion and you got the ship. I told you it would be worth it. Anyway, here are some things that you should know before you undock her for the first time:"
	description "-the ship comes with an integrated cloaking system, utilising lithium heatsinks to move heat deep into the ship in order to become invisible;"
	description "-we modified said cloaking system to turn excess heat into energy, because originally, the ship's cooling system didn't survive the crash;"
	description "-the guns on board were refurbished and tested, however they turned out to be 'illegally powerful' so the Syndicate allegedly destroyed them. My team and I decided to install a few hardpoints to not make it completely defenseless;"
	description "-every piece of higher technology installed on this ship apparently runs with some sort of fuel, a molecule that's not present in our galaxy. However, testing revealed that under optimal circumstances, the Normandy will run out of it in a few hundred years.'"
