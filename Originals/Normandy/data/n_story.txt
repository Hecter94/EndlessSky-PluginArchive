You order your officer to hover the ship while you form a squad and inspect it closely. The landscape is scorched and leveled... as if a nuclear bomb detonated here... but your scanner says otherwise. Residual matter similar to that left by hyperdrive jumps, is present everywhere. You notice beasts gnawing on bones outside the badly damaged ship. Upon examining what's left of the vessel, you discover terminals and high tech tools that look familiar to you. You order your team to rip out what appears to be a serial plate and take it to the flagship.`

I don't know what to believe anymore... give me a moment, I have to make a call." He takes out his communicator and heads into an empty bunk room.`
			`5 minutes later he returns and starts mumbling something about Syndicate Covert Ops and his next promotion... he eventually calmed down and asked you to take him to Hephaestus. You agree, this is starting to get exciting.`

Its original owners apparently managed some sort of space-time travel process that consequently led to their demise. My team managed to reverse engineer some of the tech onboard, but the rest is too advanced for us to comprehend. We fully patched her up and the Syndicate CEO allowed it to be put up for sale... but only for you..."`
