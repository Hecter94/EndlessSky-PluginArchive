	description "The first new design to be produced by the Republic Navy in years, the Assault Cruiser is the Navy's response to the use of nuclear weaponary during the war. In lieu of drone or fighter carrying capabilities, the Assault Cruiser carries with it a large number of missile launchers, allowing it to keep its distance from nuclear-missile-wielding ships."
