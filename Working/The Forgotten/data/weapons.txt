	description "Sailors often call this turret the Death Row, because if enemy missiles are close enough for it to fire at full speed, you’re at death’s door. This weapon has a very short range; however it does immense damage to any missile close enough to be targeted. It is the only AMT in the New Systems capable of destroying the infamous Harbinger missile in one hit. Most small naval vessels are equipped with these to screen large missiles before they can impact capital ships."

	description "The Gatling missile defense is essentially a scaled down version of the Gatling weapon used in the Origin Systems. When the Polybolos rapid fire missile was introduced to warfare,  a weapon capable of keeping up with the sheer numbers was in high demand. The result was this turret, which has a very high rate of fire, and it has become the primary missile shredder in the New Systems."

	description "While the Flak AMT does relatively little damage compared to the other two systems, it has substantially longer range. It has mostly been phased out due to the introduction of the Gatling system, but still finds its place on the largest Anti-Missile ships, who are required to protect the entire fleet spread across the battle."

	description "The Lancer was named for an ancient weapon that was designed to go through a foe’s body protection. Just like its ancient kin, the Lancer is built to go through it’s foe’s protection and damage the hull directly. The projectile required must be so small though, that it does not do an immense amount of damage. Because of this it has been limited to use in small vessels and patrol craft."

	description "The Winchester is currently the longest ranged gun in the New Systems. While it does not do a lot of damage per second, it is highly effective when deployed on ships near the outskirts of a system with a defense fleet positioned in the middle, as is a textbook military strategy at the Confederation Officer School. In order to make the best use of available resources, all shells are extracted for re-use once they are fired."

	description "The Tsar is as fierce as its name implies. Very few ships carry it due to its size, but it is highly favored by Neo-Hegemony captains who love a heavy hitter. That mentality also explains why many of those captains are banned from establishments all over the New Systems."

# TURRETS

		"shield damage" 12.4
		"hull damage" 42.6
	description "The cannonade is the base weapon that inspired the MoonQuaker. It is able to fit on more ships in the fleet, and less demanding on the energy reserves and cooling of said ship. They are a fairly old weapon, and have been around since long before the wars began. In order to keep them up to par with current weapons, their solid shell ammunition was upgraded with a light explosive. This effectively removed the impact this weapon caused, but increased its damage. Their longevity in service should speak to their usefulness."

		"shield damage" 43.9
		"hull damage" 139.9
	description "The MoonQuaker is the most powerful offensive turret available, and fires shells intended to destroy large ships. It is a very large weapon and small ships typically could not even use one effectively. These do not do much shield damage, as they are designed to enter range after missiles should have impacted their targets and softened them up."

		"shield damage" 860
		"hull damage" 276
	description "The Tempest Coil Launcher is a prototype weapon, intended to be used alongside more conventional armaments. Its development began roughly 10 years before the wars did, in response to the improvement to shield technology. Its sole purpose is to drastically drain the shields of an enemy, allowing all vessels in the fleet to deal substantial damage. It’s only drawbacks are the level of energy required to power it, and its sheer size."

	description "Polybolos missiles are extremely weak, but fire rapidly. They do minimal damage in their own right, while effectively distracting enemy AMT turrets from shooting at the more damaging Harbinger and Kestros missiles. They were created in response to the Gatling AMT having nearly rendered missile weapon systems useless, and completely revitalized missile technology in war."

	description "The Kestros is the go to missile system for all sizes of combat ships. Without it multiple classes of warship would be obsolete. It was designed to do damage while being cheap and easy to mass produce. Since it is the mainstay missile of various fleets, it is given the best tracking available, and locks into it’s targets very effectively."

	description "The harbinger torpedo is an extremely powerful system, however it has it’s fill of drawbacks. While it has the most power of the three missiles mass produced in the New Systems, it is the slowest and weakest homing of all three. When AMT technology advanced, Harbingers become obsolete as they were consistently shot down before reaching their targets. However when the Polybolos missile was created, the Harbinger came back to prominence. The two systems paired are very lethal."
