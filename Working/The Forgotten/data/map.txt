It takes a brave person to settle here, but many have taken that call. Many who do not feel enough thrill after they retire from combat travel here to hike the hills and climb the volcanos.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is built far from the nearest volcano, but any pilot can still see the closest peak. ocassionally the shipyard auctions off a ship left abandoned by the pilot who tried to explore too far, and never returned to claim their vessel.`

	spaceport `Given the non military nature of clothing, it is sold freely and in abundance here. Merchants who trade with all three factions come here to take the clothing all over the New Systems. Basel shipyards distribute so many tons of clothing that no other planet can compete with the pricing, and some have given up significant clothing production entirely.`

They make ready use of the available population as a workforce for maintaining their navy, and import new people from all over their space to grow the laborforce.`
	spaceport `This shipyard has one of the highest maintenance turnover rates in the New Systems. With the abundant population employed by the navy on Beaumont, they can sucessfully protect the system from both lanes of Genesis Directive attack without any real down time for damaged ships. This spaceport is one of the sole reasons for the stalemate on this front.`

However since there has obviously been some form of catastophe, as Boulder keeps it's namesake, that turned the planet into a large rock. That plant life has since turned into fossile fuels underground, and Neo-Hegemony civillians are employed to extract it from under the surface.`
	description `	There is a particularly high death rate among crews here, and most of the fuel extraction is done by enslaved and conscripted crews from foreign planets.	Increasing local crime.`
	spaceport `This is a very rough spaceport. Visittors must watch their pockets, and their blood. As theives are willing to be both stealthy and outright attack their prey. `

	spaceport `When landed, ships are clamed down to the surface. This is because of the high tectonic activity on Burke. It makes some pilots feel uncomfortable having their ship secured to the ground, where they cannot leave at a moment notice, however Burke is so far from the front lines that most pilots quickly get used to the feeling.`

They are hoping it will hold a key to their successful reunion with the Origin Systems.`
	spaceport `There is not much of a spaceport here. You can dock with some stations and maybe hire a few personel ending their manual labor shifts onboard, however this is a fairly empty system.

Many of the Genesis Directive's people find this an appealing illusion however, as it allows them to work somewhat in secret.`
	spaceport `Many people rush to and fro. They seem to each have a singular focus, barely noticing any of the others around them.

Luxuries of all kinds can be found here, for the most excellent of prices, and in nearly infinite quantities.`
	description `	There is a pretty sizeable military presence here, as the luxuries produced on Cyrene propel the Confederation economy and fuel the war effort alongside the crew recruitted from the expanding populated areas.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is large and powerful. Being a major military resuply post and economy grants this base some of the best weapons and outfits the Confederation produces.

	spaceport `The docking area is the only part of the planet not covered in smog.

It is the furthest frontier in the war, and naturally contains metals and heavy metals, making it a perfect place to repair ships with no added expense for transporting the resources. As a result there is a massive military presence here, most likely larger than even the one located in Barnell.`
	spaceport `When a vessel enters Genova's atmosphere, the pilot finds they have a lot of checkpoints to clear through before being granted access. This is definitely a completely military port, and visitors are to adhere to all standards the military vessels have to. When they finally are permitted to land, they find the greatest outfitter in Directive space, and a substantial shipyard. Most regular naval vessels can be serviced in this port. `

While the polpulus rules itself, the Confederation leaders spend a lot of time on Theia, enjoying the luxuries of their posts.`
	spaceport `When you land, you notice the port crew here are very calm and relaxed, not like the crew in other systems.

planet Kent

These are the working hands of the Directive, not scientists and researchers, but instead the manual labor. They often work in "shifts" and are sent all over Directive space. Their pay is sent back to their families and they spend a substantial amount of time at home between shifts. There are also various farms and facilities located on planet, but the pay is not quite as desireable as the off planet jobs.`
	spaceport `This is another port bustling with people, both coming and going. You can find any of the typical commodities here as well. What stands out is the facilities themselves. This port is a perfect example of mass marketting and propoganda that a typical human merchant in the Origin Systems is accustomed to seeing.

planet Lachaise

	description `Lachaise is not particularly remarkable except that is it perfectly located for trade. This trade allows the planet to boast competitive prices on all commodities, even though it has no real manufacturing of it's own. This situation is largely responsible for the Confederation's ability to field it's large navy.`
	spaceport `Messier is one of two major trade crossroads in the Confederation. This allows them a higher level of influence on trade regulation than others. This has made the leaders on Lachaise one of the primary groups pushing the militirization of trade. Meaning the navy partially funds itself by carrying commodities on it's ships as it moves from system to system. Resulting in a much larger military budget than the other factions can bring forth.`

planet Lancaster
	landscape land/circuit0
	description `Lancaster is a planet with no real practical resources for construction, and was initally overlooked during the first wave of colonization. After spending a substantial time uninhabited, a research team discovered deposity of conductive materials here, this planet then became a major production facility for electronic components. Cities have begun to grow around these deposits, and the system has grown in importance. As a result of that growing usefulness, the pace of military patrolls going through the system has also increased.`
	spaceport `The spaceport and market are combined on this planet. Obviously a carryover from it's days of lesser importance, it is now an extremely crowded and slow moving place. Visitors must be prapered to wait for an extensive time to have their wares loaded and unloaded. They must also watch their pockets, as the crowds make a haven for pickpockets and merchants alike.`

	spaceport `When you land you immediately pull your clothes over your face. The sand is so thick you feel like you should have special equipment here.

	spaceport `There are few planets in the New Systems which boast as many ships as Largan Station. Some damaged and being repaired, some resupplying, and others just being built. This is a highly impressive operation, and explains why this system has never changed hands during this 20 year war.`

planet Lincolnshire

	description `Lincolnshire is named for Newtons birthplace.This is largely because it's geography resembles his home, rolling hills and grasslands. Food and medicines are made here in reasonable quantities, and it's the only shared border with the Genesis Directive. The people here have grown accusted to a large naval presence, and embrace the salor's role within their society. Often the sailors are seen playing sports and mingling with the poulace during their R&R time, and whenever they can reasonably have time off. They often marry within the local population.`
	spaceport `There is quite an unusual sight at this spaceport. As a merchant walks around they see navy sailors and civilians talking and laughing together as they go about their business. Most planets have a certain level of animosity between them, and their social status tends to drive that wedge even deeper. The ease of that relationship makes this port run very smoothly. A captain can find their ship is loaded almost as soon as their credits are transferred.`

Building are errected quickly, and often not of the greatest quality. However this is done with the knowlege that most people do not live in them for long, before being moved to another planet.`
	spaceport `This is easily one of the most crowded spaceports in Neo-Hegemony space. Lots of conscripts returning home until their next tour of work, and many people leaving both voluntarily and not so voluntarily.

Regen produces more medicines than any New System, and the market for them is tighly controlled. The Genesis Directive allows some to be sold, as there are populations who need them everywhere in the New Systems, however they do not wish to provide assistance to the enemy war effort.`
	spaceport `Not much is going on here. The medicine market is strictly controlled, and Regen doesn't boast a very large population to supply. Despite this the merchants do have a sizeable enough reserve to provide you with whatever goods you request, and enough funds to buy whatever you offer.`

	description `	Most of the people who live here do not venture outside, and the ground based landing pads all have docking clamps like a space station to prevent accidents from being caused by the harsh weather. Any repairs that need done are completed within an internal docking bay, set underground. Despite these obstacles, mining and trade are completed regularly.`
	spaceport `Once a pilot has crossed the docking clamps and entered the trading center, they are often impressed at the expense the local goverment has gone to in it's construction. Bays large enough to hold and repair some of the Directives largest ships are plentiful, and smaller ships are easily repaired several per bay. This facility is a perfect example of the New Systems tendency to value efficiency over comfort and appearance. Every repair bay is the same, mass produced and designed to work for every situation. Often the port authority here is selective with who it allows to land, and the pilot must have made a good impression on the Directive.`

Most enterprises passed this planet up as a lost cause, not worth the expense of colonizing. However the "lesser elements" of society have chosen to make this place home. Rather than throw their lot in with Neo-Hegemony as most of the rougher types did, they chose a lifestyle that allowed themselves the most independance from the larger governments.`
	spaceport `This system being named after Einstein, it seems appropriate that it would be a planet for gamblers. His theories on Quantum physics are often referred to as a great gamble, not confirmed until 100 years later.`
	spaceport `	As you look around you see nothing but glowing lights and fancy clothes. People from all three factions have found transport to the back of Confederation space to visit these facilities.  There are grand casionos everywhere, but nothing like these. There are multiple stories in the building closest to you, and the one beyond it boasts "Five indoor tracks" on it's biggest sign.

The consistent climate and lower casualty rate make it a posting in very high demand.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is pretty slow and comfortable. There are enough travelling vessels that trade is proftable, and the constant presence of navy sailors keeps the markets well paid. However the laziness comes from the fact repairs are uncommon and trading vessels are fairly small through this sector of Directive space. The local trade station contributes to the economic growth and has brought some comfort between Genesis Directive and Confederation merchants, as it is a sort of neutral ground between them.`
