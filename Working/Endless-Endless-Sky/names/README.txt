star names 1 is from the stellaris mod, "Just Star Names" https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1212536129
This list is very traditionally star-like, with lots of proper and constellation sounding names. These contain some prefixes such as "Alpha, Beta, Xi, Iota" etc for around 1800 of the total 4500 stars. There are also plenty of proper star names just like star list 2.

star names 2 is from eddb.io, a site with data for elite dangerous. It has around 14,000 stars, mostly with unique proper names, and should be more than enough variety. There are also some random names like HIP 1023 and 10 Iota Cygni. This star list is a good mix between random and proper names.

star names 3 is a gargantuan list from eddb.io and contains a lot more numbers and more catalog-like names. This is literally huge and no-one will probably ever need to use it, but if 20,000 stars from the first 2 lists combined aren't enough, this list will carry you to around 170,000 stars. That many is certainly too many for endless sky, but if you're crazy and want to, its here (but the script will probably take forever to generate enough stars to use all of these, but if you do that don't blame me :)

Later I will run these star names through the language mixer to get more variety as well.

Planet names 2-7 took planet names 1 and ran it through this: http://chaoticshiny.com/langreplace.php. This language mixer mixes up some letters and changes how the names sound. Look through some of the lists to find one you like that fits your content.
