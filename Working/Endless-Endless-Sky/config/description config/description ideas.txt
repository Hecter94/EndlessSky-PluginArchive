These are just a few ideas of things to describe in your planet descriptions.

Types of descriptions:
    scientific planetary properties, detailed terrain/climate descriptions, economic/main industry description, city description/populace

system properties
    Stellar activity (frequent solar flares, increased magnetic output), mention stuff like "the sun is very active" or something
    Asteroids, comets, frequent meteor showers, (daily meteor showers?), mineral rich asteroids boosting industry
planetary properties
    gravity
    atmospheric properties (greenhouse effect, main gases, volatile gases, trace atmosphere if living in pressurized(domes,caves) environment, thin/thick atmo, etc.)
    magnetosphere
    radiation levels
    Planetary tilt: extreme seasons?
    Fast/Slow rotation speed? Day length?
    Tidally locked?
    planet size
climate
    temperature
    ocean cover percentage/amount (oceans cover most or very little of the planet)
    weather type (calm, rains, clouds, extreme weather, lightning, storms)
Terrain
    terrain (mountainous, hillyness, plains)
	land covering amount/amount of continents (lots, little)
    biome (there could be a LOT of variation here)
		arctic, desert, ocean, archipelligo, forest, hills, cliffs, badlands, rocky, dusty, farmland
    water content
life
    plants (trees (sparse, light forest, dense forest, type (spruce, oak, deciduous, evergreen), height (short, unusually tall due to high oxygen, etc.)), grasses(type), shrubs, weeds(unique weeds? super growth?), cacti, lichen, moss)
    crops (fields, hydroponics, small gardens, greenhouses, monoculture)
subterranean properties
    mineral content
    rock type
    metal rich/poor
    heavy metal rich/poor
economy
	planet wealth
    set of descriptions of stuff for each commodity? (ex make clothes cheap in level x systems,  then put a description of the mills and their conditions in a level x description file, or the mines if metal is cheap in level x systems, or the medicine or electronics factory etc.)
cities
    city size (new town, small town, large town, small city, medium city, big city, huge city, sprawling city)
    architecture age (modern, aging, colonial, living in enclosed habitats)
	architecture materials (stone, granite, wood, sod, sandstone, built into cliffs, metal, concrete)
    pollution (or lack thereof)
populace
    primary profession (tie to economy)
    average worker wealth
    average education (high, low, or do they go to other planets)

spaceport
    location (urban, structured, crappy scattered landing pads, pad material (concrete, gravel), inside building, outside, tunnels/roofs, main building)
    business (insanely busy, bustling, crowded, not very busy, deserted)
    technology level (smooth automated air traffic control, or haphazard, disorganized freeform landing?)
stations
    main industry (refueling, trade, outpost, mining oversight, military)
    population
    trade
    how well traveled is this station, is it in a system with another planet?
