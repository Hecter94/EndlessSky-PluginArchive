DESCRIPTIONS
Each time a planet is generated, it will call a random description file from the "description" folder, and then pick a random line from that file as the description. 

WORDS
Any word or phrase surrounded by <> will be replaced by a random line from its corrosponding text file in the "words" folder. Any "word" can have more <words> in it if they are surrounded by <>. This can be used for simple things like synonyms, such as replacing the word <warm> with "hot", "boiling", or "scorching" when describing a planet to give variety. Or the randomness can be exploited to create massively branching and varied descriptions. See the written descriptions to see an example of this.

COMMODITIES
line 1 corrosponds to level 1, line 2 corrosponds to level 2, etc.
the file name is the commodity
inside, each line has commodity min, commodity max for each level
