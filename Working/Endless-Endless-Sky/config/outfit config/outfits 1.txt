The algorithm works by taking starting values within the ranges specified,
and then iterating upon them based on a curve randomly generated
between the min and max curve values. Outfit curve max should never exceed 1.
Example: A battery contains 100 energy for 10 outfit space. When iterated with
an outfit curve of .9, it calculates (10*2)*.9, resulting in 200 energy for 18
outfit space. This means that 1 big outfit will be more efficient than 2 of
the smaller outfit of the same type.

######_____ types min and max amount
The starting min and max type amounts are the amounts of "types" of that outfit
to produce. For example, in the vanilla game, there are 3 main types of
engines: ion, plasma, and atomic engines. So if you have the min engine types
at 1 and max engine types at 3, the program will generate between 1 and 3
types of engines.

_____ iteration amount
This is the amount of times to iterate an outfit type based on its starting
value. For example, in the vanilla game, there are 5 main levels or tiers of
some outfits, like batteries or fuel cells. Each one is better than the last,
but also takes up more outfit space. The program will iterate based on the
curve values given.

_____ curve values
Cost curves should be greater than or equal to 1 to make bigger outfits cost
more than their smaller counterparts. Outfit curves should always be less than
or equal to 1 in order to make larger outfits more efficient than smaller ones.
