This is also useful if you like the ships, but want to modify some values and
then run the same ships again.

warning: you will still have to choose the proper gun, turret, engine, and fighter coordinates via the ship builder. The script will put some in for you to get the amounts, but they will all be in the same place so you MUST use the ship builder to get proper coordinates. https://endless-sky.github.io/ship_builder.html
