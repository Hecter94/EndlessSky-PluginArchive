This file is the configuration for generating galaxies.
Changing these values will affect galaxy generation.


Default settings:
seed                                            10
galaxy systems is 300 (1/3 of galaxy length)    3000

min x and min y are 0             -1500 and 1500
max x and max y are 1000          -1500 and 1500

system delete distance is 50      50

hyperlane min distance is 0       60
hyperlane max distance is 100     100

use_seed - Use seed provided below, else use random seed.
False

galaxy_seed - changes which seed this galaxy config uses for generation
45

galaxy_systems - amount of systems initially generated in galaxy. This will be reduced based on system delete distance as close together systems are deleted (lots get deleted!). As a rule of thumb to find this number: find the area of your galaxy (base * height) and divide by 3000. This should get close to the amount of systems you need to produce a nice vanilla like distribution. If you want the script to do this calculation automatically, type 'auto' without the quotes instead of a number. Please experiment to find a distribution you like based on your other settings, you can't really go wrong experimenting here if you view the outputted galaxy afterwards.
5000

system_delete_distance - delete any systems this close together. Using lower values will make the galaxy denser if you have enough stars, but values too close to or over 100 will make jump drive travel difficult, if not impossible. Leaving this around 50 gets a good vanilla-like distribution.
45

galaxy_is_circle - should the galaxy be generated in a circle instead of square - true or false
true

galaxy_randomize_center - Default True
True

galaxy_center_x
1000

galaxy_center_y
-50000

galaxy_radius_x
2500

galaxy_radius_y
2500

hyperlane_min_distance - minimum distance between systems a hyperlane will generate (recommended to have the min equal to the system delete distance)
45
hyperlane_max_distance - maximum distance between systems a hyperlane will generate
110

wormhole_chance - Chance of generating wormholes. #default .001, range 0 to 1
0.001

infinite_asteroid_field - Generate infinite invincible asteroid fields, default true
true

# # # SYSTEM LEVELS # # #
#everything related to system levels, lots of customization here
# Idk if any of these are used anymore.

#random - assigns system levels randomly.
#radial - assigns system levels based on proximity to generated points. 
system_level_generation_type - random, radial
radial

system_level_debug - VERY useful for finding out each system's level. Once you have a galaxy you are happy with, be sure to set this to false and regenerate your galaxy so you will have the proper system names without numbers attached.
false


num_points_level_5 - number of level 5 points to be generated 
1

min_radius_from_center_level_5 - minimum radius from the galaxy center level 5 points can generate from.
50

max_radius_from_center_level_5 - maximum radius from the galaxy center level 5 points can generate from. 
200

effect_radius_level_5 - radius of effect of level 5 points. Systems closest to the center will have the highest level while systems farthest will have the lowest. Systems outside this radius will automatically have the lowest level (1).
400
