Requires Python 3.9+

Run main.py to generate a galaxy with a few factions.
If success the script will say it.

1 Sample Galaxy is already provided,
A wormhole to access will be placed in a system close to Sag* A (the black hole)

Useable Config:
-government config
-galaxy config
-use_seed and <text>_seed for most config
-planet descriptions.txt
-000 stars.txt (same format as ES stars.txt)

This is a rough proof of concept, very fragile and still buggy, beware.

#========Adding new sprites:
Currently(21/06/2022), Only new ship sprites and ship parts are supported

# Ship sprites
These are complete ship sprite ready to be used.

To add new sprite set for the script to pick from, put a txt file 
in factions folder with partial definition for a ship. The script
will look for the sprite in the name and use it for the specified 
category(ies).

"ship" and "category" is required, hardpoints lines (gun,turret,engine)
only helps the script put weapon in correct places. Else it'll be random.

For multiple category the script will allow the sprite to be used 
for both categories.

[text] is optional modifier for hardpoints.  (Currently generator don't do anything with it)

Format: *Use only tabs for indents.

ship <sprite name>
	category <category1>
	category <category2>
	gun <x> <y>
		[over]
		[parallel]
		[angle] <n>
	turret <x> <y>
		[under]
	engine <x> <y>
		[zoom] <n>
		[angle] <n>
		[over]

# Ship parts
These are smaller parts of a ship where the script can assemble a new ship from.
Any folder without 000 prefix will be read and used. Several suffix can be used for
ship parts to tell the script what kind of part it is, see human folder for examples.
Note -greeble is disabled at the moment
Also note *all* part type should exist for the generator to use or it may fail.
