			`	The Kraz Cybernetics receptionist points you in a familiar direction, towards the hangar where Barmy Edward does his work. You do not find him there; instead, you are greeted by one of his colleagues: "Good afternoon. Captain <last>, is it? I'm Dr. Chris Cardona. I work with Mr. Edward on the occasional project, including this latest prototype. We had some - uh - technical difficulties with the fuel injection component, and Mr. Edward is on temporary medical leave. Not to worry, he left me with clear instructions regarding your assignment."`
			`	He seems unfazed by this state of affairs.`
			`	Just as before, you are to engage our test ship in combat in orbit above <planet> and attempt to disable it without causing permanent damage to its hull. In this case, it is a salvaged Argosy, the Redhammer."`
			choice
				`	"Technical difficulties?"`
				`	"Medical leave?"`
			`	"Yes, the fuel injector came loose and doused the hangar with hyperspace fuel. It didn't ignite, but Mr. Edward inhaled enough of the vapours to put him out of action for a few weeks. Thankfully, the lab was not damaged, and production of test units is still on schedule."`
