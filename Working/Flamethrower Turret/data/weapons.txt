	description "The turret-mounted flamethrower represents the epitome of Free Worlds creative extravagance. So great are its fuel requirements that it comes with a standard fuel pod pre-installed, though no prudent captain would leave port without a reliable ramscoop as well. Smaller ships which lack powerful cooling systems should stay out of range at all costs."
