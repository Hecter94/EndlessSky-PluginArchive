			`As you walk through the spaceport, you notice a poster featuring Amy, whom you previously helped terraform this world and Rand. The poster describes that terraforming action, and the long-term goal to restore the warmer climate Tundra had millions of years ago. Amy's work on "equilibrium mapping," the idea that planets naturally "want" to support more complex and varied life, seems similar to the Wanderer philosophy that each planet has its own "will", and that the best way to terraform it is to work with that "will." Amy may be interested in learning about the Wanderers and their techniques. Would you like to find her and tell her about them?`

			`	You're able to contact Amy. She has been continuing to monitor the status of Tundra's climate, alongside the researchers from the Deep who she worked with to terraform this world. You tell her you've encountered some alien terraformers who may share her philosophy. She is eager to learn more about them and agrees to meet you in the spaceport bar.`
			`	Once she arrives, you explain about the Wanderers: that the work of their civilization is to repair worlds left in ruin by their previous inhabitants, and about their view that those worlds have their own identities that they must collaborate with in order for terraforming to be successful.`
			`	She has a slew of questions ranging from how the Wanderers determine a planet's identity to how often asteroids are used in their work. Unfortunately, you are not able to offer much information about the specific details of how the Wanderers go about their terraforming work. Disappointed, but not defeated, Amy asks, "Could you take me to visit these aliens?"`
			`	Now that the Kor Mereti drones are peaceful, and the Kor Sestor drones have been eliminated, there is no longer an immediate threat to the Wanderers, and they will be focused much more on their work to repair the former Korath worlds. They would probably be happy to discuss some of that work with someone as enthused by the prospect as Amy.`

			`As you approach <planet>, Amy is astounded by the magnitude of volcanic ash in the air, far exceeding what was released by the volcano you triggered on Tundra. "This place makes Tundra seem temperate," she remarks after observing the glaciers that occupy most of the planet's polar regions.`
			`	Her fascination with the state of this world is temporarily forgotten when she exits your ship and sees the Wanderers for the first time. "I don't know what I expected them to be like, but it wasn't birds," she mumbles, staring at them from head to toe. However, she quickly returns to the reason for coming here. "Do you know how we can find someone who can answer my questions?"`
			`	You approach one of the nearby Wanderers and ask if they could direct you to Tema'a Iriket, the terraforming director. They don't appear to understand the Hai language, but they seem to recognize the name and gesture for you to wait in the spaceport, before heading off in a different direction, presumably to fetch Iriket for you.`

			`It is not long before Iriket arrives. You introduce Amy to her, and explain why you have brought her here. "I would be [glad, honored] to answer any questions about our work," she agrees.`
			`	What follows is an extensive discussion about how the Wanderers go about planning the terraforming process for a world. Topics range from the earliest considerations as to what the goal for each planet should be to the role of their artificial minds in helping to monitor and guide the process in the long term. Your translator has some difficulty with the more technical aspects of the discussion, which leads Iriket to rephrase some things many times. Throughout it all, Amy is taking copious notes. Iriket also explains some of what they have been doing to improve the climate on this world.`
			`	"The gases [released, produced] by the factories will help the atmosphere retain more heat, which will in turn begin to melt the glaciers and return water to the [ecosystem, environment]. Over time, this will [mix, interact] with the abundant ash, helping to [restore, rejuvenate] the soils all over this world. In time, it will become [fruitful, bountiful] again."`
			`	"Won't that take hundreds or thousands of years?" Amy asks.`
			`	"Indeed," says Iriket. "But, to attempt to [accelerate, advance] the process by more [direct?] means would [harm, deteriorate] the product. While some worlds may [benefit from, require] a more [extreme, radical] change to begin their restoration, we do not believe it is [necessary, appropriate] here. It is [important, our goal] that a world at the conclusion of our work not only be [pristine, healthy] in that moment, but that it be [sustainable?] without additional [intervention, support]."`
			`	Eventually, Amy asks, "Are there any worlds where you have completed your work that I could see?" Iriket suggests <destination>, and asks you to take them there.`

			`You fly across large swathes of the planet's surface, giving Amy a view of all the greenery and the oceans here. Meanwhile, Tema'a Iriket describes the condition of this world when the Wanderers first began working on it. "The atmosphere was [close to, nearing] a [runaway, uncontrolled] greenhouse effect. Many species had recently gone extinct, or were very close to it. The oceans were also quite toxic. Now, the atmosphere is [stable, sustainable], and many of the species that were [on the brink?] of extinction now flourish."`
			`	Amy also explains about her recent experimental terraforming. "We believe the planet used to be temperate, or even tropical millions of years ago. We used an asteroid impact to trigger a supervolcano that was close to eruption. The greenhouse gases from the eruption have already begun to warm the climate."`
			`	Iriket thinks for a moment before responding. "Using the planet's [features, assets] to restore more habitable conditions is an [admirable?] approach." The approval buoys Amy, but she is somewhat deflated by what comes next. "However, an asteroid would not be our [preferred, first] step."`
			`	As you conclude your sightseeing, Tema'a Iriket says your next stop should be <planet>, where she will provide Amy with more detailed records of their terraforming activities than she can provide orally.`
			`	Once Iriket has returned to her bunk, Amy says to you, "I wonder what my professor would say about 'anthropomorphizing planets' if he saw this," she gestures towards the images of <origin> on the monitors, "and you told him they believe planets have their own identities, too."`
