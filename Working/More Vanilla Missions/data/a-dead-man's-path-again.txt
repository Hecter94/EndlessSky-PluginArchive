			`At night, the spaceport on <origin> livens up. There are porters running to and from depots with crates, crewmen buying rounds of drinks for each other around the bars before they hit the bed, and bands of Navy officers jovially greeting captains and systematically inspecting ships. The energy and self-purpose of this spaceport is on full display tonight.`

			`After waiting two hours in the spaceport's bar, Liam and Sophie come back with unexpectedly broad smiles on their faces. You flag them down from your table and they eagerly take a seat.`
			`	Liam speaks as soon as he can. "Captain <last>, it turns out we will need a bit more than just a ride home! Have you decided to help us again?"`
			choice
				`	"What do you want me to do?"`
				`	"Tell me more before I decide."`
			`	Sophie smiles at her brother. "Of course, Liam just can't wait to get started!" She turns back to you. "Maybe I should start with who our father was. We didn't get to know him very well - he came home only occasionally. Don't get me wrong, our parents weren't fighting, but he had this passion: he couldn't stay in one place for very long. He was a captain, not unlike you, and he was restless to explore even the furthest parts of the galaxy. We believe he traveled further than most human captains; sometimes he brought small items back home that nobody could explain."`
			`	She pauses for a moment. "Anyway, his testament says he left something behind for us on <planet>, in <system>. He said that he wouldn't make it easy though; he loved fantasy books, and there's always an air of mystery to those stories. He told us of a few systems we should visit before we go to Prime. It'll be like one last fantasy story from dad!`
			`	"Of course, it would be much easier if we could go directly to Prime, but we want to respect our father's last will." She looks directly at you now. "And that is why we need your help. Could you help us again and take us through all these systems?"`

Those systems are spread far out around human space, but apparently they all have something unique to them. We've never really traveled beyond our home planet, so it'll be quite a big adventure for us! We can offer 50,000 credits. Does that sound good?"`
			choice
				`	"Sounds good!"`
				`	"Sorry, I won't be able to take you. Those systems are too far away from each other."`

It is only when you have all stepped out into Prime's spaceport that Sophie says, "Captain <last>, you've helped us immensely, and we can't thank you enough for bringing us all across the galaxy! But we have one last request. Both of us think that you should come with us to see what our father left behind. Do you want to see it?"`

			`	Liam pulls out a map - not the starmap he had before, but a local map of Prime marked 'New Toulouse'. "Apparently our father bought a whole mountain on this planet, and he wants us to go there. It's to the west of us near the New Pyrenees, a little while away from Prime Central Spaceport where we are."`

					goto shuttle
				`	"We could also have a look around here, and see why your father chose this planet."`
			`	"You're right. I hadn't thought of that, surely there was a reason he picked here," Sophie says."`
			`	All three of you walk around the spaceport district for some time. Coming into a giant plaza, you see one of the newest models from Betelgeuse, a Behemoth, on display in the center. The massive freighter with its many turret emplacements towers over even the plaza, an obvious showcase of Prime's leading shipbuilding industry.`
			`	Liam's face brightens as if he just understood something. "I think our father chose this planet because he was always a fan of Betelgeuse ships. Before he went on his adventures he used to be a test pilot for the shipyard."`
			`	Sophie nods. "Right! And once he was allowed to keep one of their experimental models as a gift for being one of their most productive pilots. Betelgeuse almost wouldn't let him go when he wanted to leave and explore the galaxy! But we're running out of time. Shall we go to the mountain now?"`
			choice
				`	"We should take a shuttle. It'll be the fastest way."`
					goto shuttle
				`	"Let's take the maglev, we should make it before it gets dark."`
					goto maglev
			label shuttle
			`	After a short shuttlecraft flight on Prime's extensive and well-maintained shuttle service, you and the siblings arrive at a provincial city, where you can see a small mountain that stands alone against the rest of the landscape.`
				goto mountain
			label maglev
			`	You take a maglev from the spaceport and get a tour through some of the regions of Prime's mainland; on the way you pass through the fields of New Toulouse, where the majority of the local agricultural industry is located, and into the New Pyrenees hills. After an hour you and the siblings step off at a provincial city. Although Betelgeuse starts to recede behind the horizon, you can see a small mountain that stands alone against the rest of the landscape.`
			label mountain
			`	Liam, with the help of the map, guides all of you to the base of the mountain, where you come across a flat wall embedded into a small cavern in its side. "There's a phrase our father left in the instructions: 'Edr- i fen,'" he explains, a little embarrassed at his inability to pronounce it. "I don't know what it means, but I'm certain it has something to do with one of these fantasy novels he used to read."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds funny, but let's say it."`
				`	"You've got a strange dad, but I like his sense of humor."`
			`	Sophie counts to three, and then all of you shout out the phrase together.`
			`	Suddenly, a bright blue line appears on the wall. For a second, a flash blinds you and there is a dim hissing noise, like the sound of rock being cut by a laser. As you look back, the line forms into a blue rectangle, the shape rapidly expanding down the wall. When it reaches the ground, the shape has become large enough to cover a human.`
			`	For a moment, nothing happens, and the siblings are too stunned to do anything. The rectangle starts flashing between different hues of blue, until the whole section and the stone it covered disappears suddenly to leave behind a cavity in the wall. "I could have sworn the stone was real," Liam says under his breath.`
			choice
				`	"Well, this is a real adventure. Lets go!"`
					goto enter
				`	"We don't know what's inside there. Be careful."`
			`	"Well, now that you say it, I recently bought a small camera drone," Liam responds. "We can use it to scout out the hallway. It's only in infrared, so we won't see too many details," he adds. Liam starts the drone and guides it using a small remote control with integrated display. After some time, the drone flies back out and he tells you, "I think it is safe. We can go."`
			label enter
			`	In single file, the three of you enter the hallway behind the opening. Strangely, the stone walls are perfectly smoothed off, and the light that guides you through seems to come out of nowhere. "To use alien technology for something like this," Sophie laughs, "that's totally our dad."`
			`	For a long while the three of you continue through the stone hallway, the light following your movements, until it opens up into a dome-shaped room brilliantly bathed in blue light. On the walls, there are all manner of alien artifacts lined up next to each other, but at the center of the room there is a pedestal with a sword inserted into it. A small tablet stands in a socket in front of it.`
			choice
				`	(Go up to the sword.)`
					goto "sword scene"
				`	(Take a look around first.)`
			`	You walk around to the right of the dome to the collection of alien objects, all steel in color and rather blocky. "Wow, he must have always brought us back the small items from his expeditions, because these artifacts over here are huge!" Liam exclaims from another part of the dome. "How did he even move all these here?"`
			`	Now that Liam points it out, many of the larger artifacts over his way look similar to the Sheragi technology you studied with Albert Foster.`

			`	After some time, Sophie calls you both to come and look at the tablet.`
			choice
				`	(Go over to Sophie.)`
			label "sword scene"
			`	Approaching the tablet, there is a short message written on it:`
			`			"My dear children. The galaxy runs far and wide, and I have traveled many places, more than most in many lifetimes. I have seen many worlds, both alien and human, too. It was my life's work.`
			`			"But still, there were many paths I did not take, many rocks I have left unturned, and many worlds I have not yet landed on. And I suspect that you will have read this before those destinations were reached. Well, I have arrived at a different destination now, the only one nobody can understand, but everybody reaches eventually. Do not fear for me.`
			`			"This room you are in now is the culmination of all my work. I hope you understand that it was for your sake that I kept these a secret. My journey was long and unforgiving, but it was my life. I hope you continue that journey, to understand the universe a little better.`
			`			"Your father."`
			`	Understanding the personal nature of the message, you leave the two of them alone for a bit, walking around and looking at the artifacts on the left of the dome.`
			`	After some time, the siblings call you back. Sophie says, "Captain <last>, Liam and I have thought about this, and we think that we would never be able to live up to our father's expectations if we kept this sword. We can study all these artifacts and understand more about the universe through them, but we cannot study this one. To understand its power, it needs to be used.`
			`	"This sword was always at our father's side, and it has been many places. Take it to many more." She pulls the sword from the pedestal, and gives it one last look over before handing over it to you. "It is yours now."`
