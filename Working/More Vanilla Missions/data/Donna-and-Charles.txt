"We were yard workers here on <origin> for nearly fifty years, but we're both starting to get too old for our jobs. So, we've made the hard decision to retire. We've already chosen a location on the best place we could afford, which... well, happened to be on Earth, so Charles and I are looking for someone to transport us. Oh, where are my manners? I'm Donna. Pleased to meet you."`
			`	Donna was clearly looking for someone besides her husband to talk to, but Charles begins to frown. "I suppose you could put it like that."`
			`	"Is that wrong?" Donna replies anxiously, bracing for the response.`
			`	The man's look of resignation starts to turn to one of anger. "Of course it's wrong. We've spent our whole lives working for these spoiled brats, and what do we get in return? We get dumped on Earth like we're dead weight!"`
			`	"I know you're upset about this," interrupts Donna, "but just getting angry isn't going to change anything!" Charles remains silent for a long time, and then mutters a reluctant apology.`
			`	Donna talks to you again. "I'm sorry about that. As you can tell, we're under a lot of stress right now. I can tell that you're a star captain. Can you help take us to Earth? We don't have a lot of money, but we'll be glad to pay <payment>."`

			`As you enter the spaceport, you see a familiar sight. The elderly couple Charles and Donna Singer, who you helped move to Earth a while ago, are talking to a young well-dressed man. Donna looks much the same as you remember her, but Charles is sporting a bandage on his head, and one of his arms looks like it's in a sling. When they see you, Donna points excitedly in your direction, and the entire group moves to meet you.`
			`	"Captain! I never thought we would see you again," Donna begins. "I'd like to introduce you to my son, Abel." She gestures to the young man, who shakes your hand vigorously. Now that you're close, you can see that he is dressed very finely. His suit is made of expensive wool with ebony buttons, his shoes are emblazoned with designer logos, and you can see a jewel-encrusted watch peeking out from underneath the well-tailored cuff of one arm.`
			`	"It's great to meet you, Captain...?"`
			choice
				`	"<first> <last>."`
				`	"<last>."`
			`	"Captain <last>," he smiles. "How very nice to meet you indeed. My parents here told me what you did for them. If I may introduce myself more fully, I am Abel Singer, Assistant Vice President of Investments for Syndicated Systems. I want to thank you for going out of your way to help my parents when they needed it most."`

			`	"I've not been the best son," Abel says, staring down at his feet. "My parents are very dear to me, of course. But I was so busy with work, I thought they could take care of themselves. So I left them to their own devices. I didn't even think to wonder about their financial position, and my father here was too proud to say it out loud." He turns to look his father in the eyes. "Still, I should have known better. I'm sorry, Dad."`
			label injuries
			`	Charles grunts, but it is his wife who speaks up next. "Shortly after we arrived, a gang of local teenagers began terrorizing our retirement community. At first it was just vandalism, but eventually it became petty theft, burglary... Nothing would have happened if Charles had just given up the necklace-"`
			`	"Give up your necklace?!" Charles snaps. "You know I couldn't do that. It was your mother's - the gift she gave you on the day of our wedding, to show you how proud she was. I'd face down those bullies a hundred times if it meant saving it."`
			`	A silence follows, but it's not uncomfortable. Donna looks at Charles with tenderness; Charles looks at her with love. Abel looks at both of them with sorrow and regret. Finally, the three of them turn to you.`
			`	"I am taking my parents to come live with me on <planet>. I think it'd be fitting if you took us. This time, I will spare no expense to ensure their safety and comfort. We will pay you <payment> for the trip."`

			`	Before leaving, each of them shakes your hand in turn, and Abel slyly deposits a credit chip worth <payment> in your palm at the end of the handshake. With a final wave, you bid the Singers goodbye and good luck.`
