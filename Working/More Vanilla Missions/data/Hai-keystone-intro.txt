			`Upon landing, you receive a message from the local port authority. "Hello, Captain <last>. We have been informed that you have recently installed a keystone, or its equivalent, onto your ship. We have registered you with the job board, which will allow you to take passengers that specifically request a keystone-equipped ship. However, be aware that most passengers will not board ships equipped with non-standard keystones." Once the message ends, you can hear a quiet tapping on the door of your ship's hatch. You turn to see a short Hai in a spaceport uniform peeking through your window. He waves and smiles.`

			`	Your deliberate disregard for the Hai at your door doesn't appear to stop him. "I saw you had a keystone installed!" His voice is muffled despite his shouting, but you can still hear what he says. "To advertise your ship's keystone in the spaceport, my advice is to mount it on the inside of your ship's main door. When you have it open, passersby can see you have a keystone and ask for transportation. You meet some funny people that way. Good luck, Captain!"`

			`	The Hai wastes no time in getting to the point; the second you open your door, he begins to speak. "I saw you had a keystone installed! To advertise your ship's keystone in the spaceport, my advice is to mount it on the inside of your ship's main door. When you have it open, passersby can see you have a keystone and ask for transportation. You meet some funny people that way. Good luck, Captain!"`
