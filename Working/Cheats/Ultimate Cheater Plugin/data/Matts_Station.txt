	description `This mod is to showcase a lot of the ships and outfits I’ve built over the past few months. Most of my mods are pretty small and this brings them together into one beautiful space station. I’d also like to thank all the members of the ES community and to give you all a shout out for being awesome! Are group is small, but it’s a good one.`
	spaceport `All around you see out of this world technology, far more advanced than what you'd normally see in human space. You can't believe your eyes, assembled are ships of all sizes and configurations. Human, and alien alike are gathered here in this secret grotto of scientific advancement and cultural understanding.`
