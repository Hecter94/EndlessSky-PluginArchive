	description "The Unfettered originally intended this ship to be carried by the Solifuge, but as they made sure it was good enough for combat it quickly became apparent another ship was needed. They then felt free to turn this ship into a proper Interceptor, focusing on the weapons and durability, whilst keeping it a one squirrel craft."

	description "There are rumors that there is only one ship like this one, but it is able to be whenever it is most needed, never spotted or destroyed. Even missiles cannot seem to find a lock on this ship, including when it chooses to be seen, rushing in for the kill."
	description "	It comprises of an elite Unfettered team, equipped with advanced armor and weapons, and the right modifications to make sure it does not shine in battle, but is instead impossible to notice. Some say that once you see this ship approaching your world, you may as well abandon it, because surely at some point the Unfettered will come in whatever force is necessary."

	description "A new design for dealing with the Wanderer ramp up in ship production and durability, meant en masse to provide a broad base for delivering ionizing damage at range in order to expose targets to more direct fire from other ships. Running with a lighter crew but greatly expanded cargo space compared to the classic Shield Beetle, it also serves as a platform to acquire plunder in battle or bring weapons and war supplies to the newly conquered worlds while fielding more firepower and durability than the Water Bug." 
	description "	Due to its lack of turrets, this ship can be vulnerable to missiles and relies on cover from accompanying ships to screen them out for it. Violin Spiders can be especially adept at protecting it against smaller, more agile enemies as well."

	description `This ship was built by the Unfettered, and rushed out using existing designs, improved with Wanderer technology and shipyards. It is intended as the peak of their shipbuilding capabilities, and is meant to be able duel even the biggest of Wanderer ships, at close range.`
	description "	Due to its high crew and cargo capacity, as well as general size, it is more than able to stand out on its own, and be used for long distance missions."

	description "This is one of the first iterations of the later released Solifuge the Unfettered have designed. This one lacks appropriate engines, but the Unfettered decided to mitigate that by making it a defensive space station, using newly developped long range pulse weaponry, and its drone complement to be able to pin down enemies and shoot them from a distance."
