The effect of firing this weapon can be devastating, but nobody ever tried to find out, given the big cost in fuel contained within the gold bars to fire it."

Their only weakness is their large turning radius: if a Tracker misses its target, it takes a long time to turn around."

	description "More intended as a way to keep enemies away than a real weapon, this gun also has its uses as an offensive tool, with the help of the pushback due to the lack of stabilizers normal pulse cannons have. It even has its uses as a mining tool. Whilst the first volley of fire is almost garanteed to catch enemies by surprise - giving you the chance to either run away, or finish them off - the enemy only has to keep their distance to render this weapon effectively useless, or apply a small amount of scrambling damage to make it unreliable. For that reason, the Unfettered refuse to consider for real military vessels, even though it is unclear wether they invented the weapon in the first place, or if some pirates got a funny idea!"

	description "Unlike a standard Pulse Turret, the Penta Pulser platform does not fire each of the five mounted Pulse Cannons in sequence, but rather in synchronized volleys."
	description "	These turrets exist because there is no such thing as 'overkill' to the Unfettered. The bigger it is, the harder it hits, the better. Unfortunately this means these turrets are highly unstable and thus require more crew to operate."
	description "	The shots go off slower than one would expect, and they are in higher quantity, although the turn rate is atrociously slow. How the Unfettered achieved this is not clear, but it must have been related to inspirations from wanderer technologies. Whatever the case, this gun showers enemies with pulse."

	description "Thanks to insights from Wanderer technology, the Unfettered have managed to create a weapon that combines the power of 8 pulse cannons into one giant ball of death, able to travel at great distances."
	description "	The resulting short beam has the strength of 10 pulse cannons and much longer range, although it consumes much more energy and heat comparatively, and the resulting projectile is much slower and loses in stability and thus damage over time. On top of that, most can only fit 2 of these because of the huge weapon space requirement, although thankfully since most of the turret is outside the ship not that much outfit space is required."

	description "	The resulting short beam has the strength of 10 pulse cannons with much longer range, although it consumes much more energy and heat comparatively. The Unfettered were able to modify it to resolve that, but they decided to keep both versions; one intended to keep enemies frightened to close the range, the other one forcing them to with sheer damage."
	description "	This version is able to keep its stability and go much faster, although for a shorter time. In fact, the Unfettered were able to make it gain damage over time as it accumulates momentum. Not many ships can even fit 2 of these because of the huge weapon space requirement, although thankfully since most of the turret is outside the ship not that much outfit space is required."

It still has the same flaws of old of requiring so much energy to fire, however, but it delivers for that in sheer strength, at short ranges. Only fools dare to approach close enough for this behemoth to fire, and they do not have long to regret their mistake. This weapon is intended to use on the new Tarantulaes and has the advantage of requiring relatively little energy for the sheer strength it delivers."

	description "As the Unfettered began to understand how the biochemical cell works, they have studied different organisms for industrial use on their own worlds, especially some of the unique extremophiles. While that study has so far still been fruitless, it has inspired the engineering through which the Ruby Generator channels excess heat towards the shield generators in order to directly infuse that energy into the shield array. The process lowers the overall heat levels on the ship considerably, but the redundant wiring systems to handle it cause more initial build up. Additionally, the converter prevents the channeling of any energy into the shield from other sources when not redirecting heat, so as to keep otherwise competing energy conduits available as soon as the heat load is high enough."

	description "The Unfettered sometimes bring a whole repair team, for their most important ships. These are the most intrepid engineers, ready to make emergency repairs whenever the conditions allow it. The team costs a lot to hire at first, along with their equipement. This also includes operating costs to acquire the materials, and cargo space to store them."
