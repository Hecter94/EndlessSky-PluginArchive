	description "Unlike a standard Pulse Turret, the Penta Pulser platform does not fire each of the five mounted Pulse Cannons in sequence, but rather in synchronized volleys."
	description "	These turrets exist because there is no such thing as 'overkill' to the Unfettered. The bigger it is, the harder it hits, the better. Unfortunately this means these turrets are highly unstable and thus require more crew to operate."
	description "	The shots go off slower than one would expect, and they are in higher quantity, although the turn rate is atrociously slow. How the Unfettered achieved this is not clear, but it must have been related to inspirations from wanderer technologies. Whatever the case, this gun showers enemies with pulse."

	description "	The resulting short beam has the strength of 10 pulse cannons and much longer range, although it consumes much more energy and heat comparatively, and the resulting projectile is much slower and loses in stability and thus damage over time. On top of that, most can only fit 2 of these because of the huge weapon space requirement, although thankfully since most of the turret is outside the ship not that much outfit space is required."

	description "	The resulting short beam has the strength of 10 pulse cannons with much longer range, although it consumes much more energy and heat comparatively. The Unfettered were able to modify it to resolve that, but they decided to keep both versions; one intended to keep enemies frightened to close the range, the other one forcing them to with sheer damage."
	description "	This version is able to keep its stability and go much faster, although for a shorter time. In fact, the Unfettered were able to make it gain damage over time as it accumulates momentum. Not many ships can even fit 2 of these because of the huge weapon space requirement, although thankfully since most of the turret is outside the ship not that much outfit space is required."

	description "As the Unfettered began to understand how the biochemical cell works, they have studied different organisms for industrial use on their own worlds, especially some of the unique extremophiles. While that study has so far still been fruitless, it has inspired the engineering through which the Ruby Generator channels excess heat towards the shield generators in order to directly infuse that energy into the shield array. The process lowers the overall heat levels on the ship considerably, but the redundant wiring systems to handle it cause more initial build up. Additionally, the converter prevents the channeling of any energy into the shield from other sources when not redirecting heat, so as to keep otherwise competing energy conduits available as soon as the heat load is high enough."
