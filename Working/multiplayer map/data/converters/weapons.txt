#GUN CALIBERS CLASSED A-D PER CALIBER
#GUN TYPES:
#Ballistic Cannon- the standard cannon for that caliber.

#Stutter Cannon- the cheekiest cannon far that caliber, stutter cannons fire large salvos at once before reloading. Much faster than even gatling cannons.

#Gatling Cannon- the high RPM cannon for that caliber, sacrifices material economy for DPS. Cheap and dirty.

#Electrothermal Cannon- the high-velocity cannon for that caliber, sacrifices energy for damage. Expensive but efficient.

#20 damage per ton per velocity!!!

	description "The Hercules Buffer Shield is small enough to fit onto anything larger than a fighter, and provides a bare, but workable buffer zone in which it can deploy its shield."
	description "Buffer Shields work by projecting an incredibly powerful shield bubble right in front of a detected projectile to destroy it before it collides with your standard shields. Due to its massive energy requirements, it has internal capacitors capable of powering itself."
