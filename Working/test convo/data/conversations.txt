conversation "intro"
	# scene goes here "something relevant"
	`	It all started several years ago when you got your first job as a labourer. Although the work was not difficult, the sheer monotony of your job made each day almost unbearable. In your free time, you watched movies and read books about faraway places featuring dashing starship captains and adventures across the galaxy. While the reality of spacefaring was not nearly as interesting as popular culture suggested, anything seemed better than what you did back then.`
	`	The daily grind eventually drove you to the breaking point. That day, you swore that you would get out of this miserable existence by becoming a starship captain, leaving this backwater planet behind for the endless possibilities of the stars. Your first step was to enrol at the planetary pilot's academy. You were initially rejected, until a little extra "fee" placed in the right hands enabled you to be registered as a student.`
	`	As time went on, it became impossible to both work and attend classes. You quit your old job and spent the majority of your time learning everything you could for the academy's final examination: the test that would determine your future.`
	`	After many sleepless nights studying and memorizing as much information as you could, the time came for you to write your piloting exam. The exam was a gruelling test of your wits and resolve, leaving you drained. You had to sell a lot of your personal possessions to get this far - you wouldn't have another chance if you failed.` 
	`	A few weeks later, you received a message from the academy. Hands trembling, you opened the message and read its contents. "Congratulations on passing your exam!" the letter began, "It is with great pride that the academy awards you your Republic pilot's license. Your official documentation will arrive in two to three weeks. Until that time, the attached temporary license shall serve as your proof of certification."`
	`	With your new pilot's license, you finally had the feeling that everything was coming together. The first hurdle had been cleared; the next obstacle was to find the credits to buy a ship of your very own. There was no way you could save up enough money working, even over your entire life - the only way forward was to take a loan. You contacted a local branch of one of the major galactic banks and arranged an appointment with a loan broker.`

		`	"I better make a good impression."`		
	scene "scene/lobby"
	`	The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them. A bead of sweat rolls slowly down your spine as you head to the elevator for your appointment.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally intimidating. Large computer monitors fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	He only becomes truly animated when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.40%, which means that your daily payments are 2503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 434,000 credits in interest. Please sign here." He grins and points to a line at the bottom of the document.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`
	name
	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby.`
	`	As you leave the bank, it feels as if a large weight has been lifted off your shoulders. You are smiling and giddy with excitement. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you; the last step before realizing your dream is to purchase a starship from the local shipyard.`
	`	You are going to make it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	``
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful, familiar smells. There are three ship models available within your price range. The model you choose will determine your future...`

	"You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check.

	"	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!"

	"	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives."
