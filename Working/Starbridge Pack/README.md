# Starbridge Pack
An Endless Sky plugin.

Includes the following ships:
Starbridge
Mod. Starbridge
Pirate Starbridge
Pirate Mod. Starbridge (not actually in the original EVN)
Rebel Starbridge
Railbridge (Mod Stabridge with wingtip blasters replaced by railguns) (Civilian/Pirate/Rebel/Forbidden variants)

Also, two types of infinite ammunition railguns have been added for the authentic EVN experience. The ships and weapons can be bought from various advanced shipyards and outfitters. As a fallback, all Starbridge variants and outfits featured in this mod are available at any Syndicate Advanced shipyard.
 
# Acknowledgments

The model used to create the graphics used in this mod is created by Autohummer, based on the appearance of the Starbridge as it appears in EVN.

The Pirate Mod Starbridge was suggested by EjoThims on discord.

The Starbridge is a ship from the game Escape Velocity Nova, according to the EVN wiki:

The Civilian Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Modified Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Pirate Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Rebellion Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.

# Installation

(From the Endless Sky Wiki)
https://endless-sky.fandom.com/wiki/Mods

Installing mods is simple: place the folder containing the mod files in a folder labeled "plugins" in one of the following locations, depending on your operating system.
Linux

    /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
    ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

Windows

    plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
    C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

Mac OS X

    Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
    ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

The end result should be something like [file-path]\endless-sky\plugins\[plugin-name], which in turn will contain that specific mod's data, images, and sounds folders, and possibly readme and copyright info.
