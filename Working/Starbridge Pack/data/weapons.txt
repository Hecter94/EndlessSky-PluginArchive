	description "Railguns are simple enough in concept; get a pellet made from a highly conductive, but dense metal (something cheap, like copper or gold), and place it between two rails (one a cathode, the other an anode). Charge the rails with a homopolar generator, and there you have it: one super-high-speed metal pellet. First developed by Sir Marcus Oliphant as a scientific instrument in the twentieth century AD. This version fires 100mm pellets."
