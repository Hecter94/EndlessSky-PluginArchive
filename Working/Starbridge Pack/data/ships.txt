	description "The Starbridge is a relatively new concept in ship design, in a Republic where ancient traditions are the rule. This vessel channels power straight from a Thorium Nuclear Furnace into its large impulse drives, bypassing life-support and even jump engines. Ancillary power is then provided by turbines mounted behind the engines. This design provides very accurate control of thrust, and great power in normal space. The single drawback is that the turbines must be very strong, pushing the price up by a large margin."

	description "The Starbridge commonly in pirate service is relatively unaltered from its base design. There are a few reasons for this, but the primary one is that the Starbridge makes an excellent pirate ship as it is! Also, a good many... <ahem> 'privateers' were consulted about the vessel's design during the planning stage, and they feel that their comments have in some way helped shape this graceful keel. Most Starbridges used by pirates haven't had their engines tweaked much, but they do have more powerful guns than normal."
