			`	The merchant shudders slightly, "It's a Leviathan; obviously marauderized, but... It carries two guns larger than I've ever seen. It pulverized the Behemoth my convoy was travelling with in moments; I even watched it beat back the Navy patrol that had come into the system at the time," He states, "I'm in dire need of aid, but please, be prepared before you challenge it," The man expresses.`
			`	This sounds quite dangerous, but could also be a good way to steal some exotic pirate tech.`
