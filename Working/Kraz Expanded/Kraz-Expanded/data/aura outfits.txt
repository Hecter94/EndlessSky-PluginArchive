	description "The Devastation Turret is a very strong turret made by the Aura after the attack of the Devourers, so they could fight back if they ever saw them again. It uses an unknown, rare substance to pierce through the enemy ship's hull, which is mined in the unhabitable planets of the Aura Space. No one but the Aura knows how it works."
