			`Upon docking with the massive Korath vessel, unlike previous encounters with their craft, this one seems to have specialised microbot defences located in every entry point. Capture looks to be hellish at your most generous approximation.`
			`	What is more interesting is that, while your sensors indicate a number of lifesigns designated as hostiles, they also are picking up almost three times that number throughout the craft.`
			`	These are most likely civilian passengers, but unlike human-style bunks, it looks like they are packed into sections of the ship, similar to some of the most packed city blocks humanity has ever managed to survive in.`
			`	Many of these signatures seem to be smaller than others, most likely children. You realise that this must be a civilian craft, and the Korath must actually live aboard their ships, meaning that most likely these lifesigns are the crews families.`
			`	Having this sort of ship in your fleet would be a boon, but is it worth the cost in Korathi lives?`
