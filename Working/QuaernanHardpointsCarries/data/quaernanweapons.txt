	description "With such a huge ship to worry about, one might think it a good idea to amp up the anti-missile systems of the Quaernan. The original designers of the ship seemed to agree, with these huge turrets providing not only direct anti-missile fire, but also radiator coils to reduce the ship's thermal footprint as well as radar jamming mechanisms."

	description "This alternate anti-missile system includes a far-reaching ray that repairs the hull, and is able to work with surprising accuracy thanks to careful calculations involving reflecting the ray off of the Quaernan's shield."
	description "Seemingly to compensate for the fact that the missile compensator doesn't have any extra missile countermeasures, it is instead an extremely powerful solo turret."

	description "Though the Quaernan doesn't have many fixed gun ports, it makes the most of them with weapons like this. The weapon fires magnetized particle clumps extremely rapidly, forming a stream of dreadly projectiles that chase their targets. Seeking via magnetism, the projectiles are more effective the more massive the target is."

	description "These are the most common type of offensive weapon on the Quaernan, and it's easy to see why. They're reliably powerful, and are able to dispense projectiles over long ranges with aplomb. Aside from the colossal size, the weapon actually seems to share a fair bit of engineering with the Kraz plasma cannon."
	description "Judging by the designation, as well as the number, it's believeable to assume that these turrets are intended to heat up a target, making it more recognizeable for the Induction Missile."

This does hurt the Quaernan's survivability, but the shotgun-like blasts are exceptionally powerful against massed targets.`

	description "The Scatter Spire is a very strange piece of equipment: it doesn't look like a turret at all! Rather, it's just a large projectile generator connected to a wide-angle lens, designed to spray projectiles every which way and hope they hit something. Though not very effective against single targets, the Spire creates so many projectiles that it's bound to eventually hit something."
	description "In addition to the projectile generator, the base of the spire also includes shield generators, indicating perhaps an original use as a defensive emplacement."

	description "Compared to other guns on the Quaernan, this weapon's range seems quite pitiful. However, once you're within its limited radius, you'll quickly learn to regret doubt you had. The Pulsar Beam works by draining power from every possible pathway on the enemy ship, focussing especially on shields. As such, the weapon does little hull damage, but massively dampens an enemy's ability to fight back."

	description "If there's one thing you probably don't want to do, it's get closer to the Quaernan. That's why, despite its lack of direct damage, the Tractor Beam is so terrifying; able to reach out over extreme distances, the beam can leverage the Quaernan's sheer mass to draw its target closer to itself, pulling the target in range of more of the Quaernan's weapons."
	description "Thanks to the fact that the weapon does damage by exerting structural stresses on its target rather than more direct means, the target ship will take damage even through shields."

You need to dedicate crew to ammunition hauling, but otherwise, it's as easy as buying materials and letting the ship do its thing."
	description "The Beehive Munitions themselves are quite imposing; a thick shell that bursts into dozens of smaller units upon nearing a target. Considering the Quaernan's defenses, you can't help but wonder if they were designed explicitly to counter this weapon."

	description "Though the Rift Tearer is undoubtedly the main gun of the Quaernan, there's something unsettlingly final about this enormous missile rig. The launcher itself is large, albeit unimpressive; the only standout aspect of the launcher is the fact that, upon firing, the launcher imparts a fair portion of your ship's shield into the projectile, making it extremely hard to destroy."
	description "What most stands out to you, however, is the enormous production machine, designed to use unimaginable amounts of power to create and consolidate antimatter into a very real, very usable form. Out of sheer respect for (and fear of) the technology, you opt to set as many overseers as possible to the task of operation."
