	"cooling" 3160
	description "In addition to the actual coolers, this cooling array runs superconductive cabling all throughout the ship, allowing for absolutely massive cooling. As the sole reason the Quaernan doesn't burst into flames the second it tries to turn itself on, the coolers on board are capable of dispelling an enormous amount of heat."

	"heat protection" 0.35
	"burn protection" 0.4
	description "Rather small in comparison to other outfits aboard the ship, the Heatshield acts as a protector against extremely high heat levels. Not only does it comprise a number of active cooling units, but it also has special architecture that reduces incoming heat damage substantially."

	"force protection" 2
	description "This is an extremely heavy, bulky set of reactive armor, designed to resist all sorts of impacts. In addition, it is also easier to repair, and there are many battery banks spread amongst the armor to allow quick distribution of power to areas that need to react to impacts."

	description "As an alternative to ramscoops, this unique unit is quite the powerhouse, able to sate the hyperspace fuel needs of dozens of human ships. Aboard the Quaernan, it serves to supply fuel to the weapons and afterburners; outfits that would otherwise take far too much fuel on their own."

	description "This massive tactics room houses not only powerful scanners, but an enormous holographic display, capable of visualizing light years' worth of data in the form of an enormous field in the center of the room. Multiple decks of command terminals surround the central floor, giving a truly awe-inspiring sense of discovery upon walking in to a battlefield simulation in full bore."

	"operating income" 2500000
	description "This place is incredibly surreal. Flora and fauna, seemingly from a number of different worlds, all grown and raised in an artifical ecosystem, the likes of which you only find on luxury liners. There's almost too much space here, with mountains carved out of what seems to be repurposed asteroid slag, and even an artificial river."
	description "Up until this point, the Quaernan has been a fairly thoroughbred military ship, but now it seems that there's more to the craft than just guns and generators. On the more practical side, you can harvest the fruits of this artificial ecosystem, and sell them whenever you have the chance."

	description "A fully automatic, drum-fed shotgun, kitted out with incendiary rounds for maximum morale damage. Hard to control, and extremely dangerous to use on one's own ship, but it's quite good fun regardless."
