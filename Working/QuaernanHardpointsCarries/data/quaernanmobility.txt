	description "If the inner workings of a standard hyperdrive weren't strange enough, this enormous drive will certainly confuse anyone who attempts to figure out how it ticks. It seems to emit somekind of massive gravitational field, and is able to exhibit a pull on everything within its range of influence, allowing the Quearnan to thrust both forwards and backwards, steer, and draw in solar wind all at the same time."
	description "During the original repairs of the ship, a massive, burnt-out conduit was found leading from this drive to the Rift Tearer."

	description "This is a colossal afterburner, used by the Quaernan when its Waveform Engines just won't cut it. The sheer power that goes through the afterburner as it fires implies a level of either material strength or engineering mastery that current day humanity has not even begun to touch."
	description "In addition to their primary firing mode, Quasar afterburners also have secondary burners that they use to shed slowing effects much more efficiently. These auxiliary burners, however, still require fuel."

	description "The Waveform Thruster is a remarkably powerful set of engines, capable of pushing even the Quearnan to moderate speeds. Able to push around thousands of tons of mass with ease, these engines are quite comparable to human atomic engines, but their enormous size has given them room to prosper."

	description "While the Quaernan's thrusters are indeed impressive, this steering system is nearly twice the size, and can make the Quaernan turn impressively quickly. Some people believe they're so powerful they can damage planets, and indeed, the Quaernan actually imparted a not-insignificant amount of heat into Hope's atmospehre when lifting off."

	description "Though still hundreds of tons in size, these curious thrusters seem like miniaturized engines in comparison to the massive, hot-running Waveform engines. Most oddly, the engines seem to double as a containment field for a substance with negative mass; so much of it, in fact, that the entire assembly actually reduces the ship's mass by nearly 200 tons, as well as completely negating the weight of the engines themselves!"
	description "The engines themselves seem to be somewhat similar to ion engines, however, the assembly of the engines reduces slowing effects."
