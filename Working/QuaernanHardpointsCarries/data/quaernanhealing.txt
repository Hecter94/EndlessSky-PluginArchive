	description "This enormous shield system is a hybrid between a massive regenerator and some kind of shield alteration field. In addition to being the primary source of shield aboard the Quaernan, it also dramatically improves the efficiency of other shield generators aboard the ship."
	description "It's believed that this device is what managed to protect the Quaernan when it crashed into Hope, as several capacitors aboard the enormous outfit were blown out during the initial repair."

	description "This massive outfit appears at first glance to be quite inefficient; however, closer inspection will reveal the clever engineering at play. While charging the shields, the device consumes extra power, using some kind of crystallization technique in the shields to provide extra shield thickness over the most vulnerable areas. The result is a much more durable shield that blocks projectiles better and is more resistant to all types of damage."

	description "This appears to be an attempt at making the Regenerator even more efficient; though it lacks the shield alteration technology of the Axonal Variant, it is not-insignificantly smaller."
	description "This regenerator works by using Deuterium as a medium to charge shields even faster, leading to rather excessive power efficiency at the cost of fuel usage and significant heat generation."

	description "A partner apparatus to the Axonal Regenerator and a massive boon in the caretaking of the ship, the Self-Maintenance Array is a massive AI computer that operates several nests of repair arms and emergency shield generators. Though not as powerful as the Axonal Regenerator, the Array's ability to fix hull drastically improves the surviveability of the Quaernan."
	description "During the crash, several repair arms were damaged, however the designs are remarkably similar to the repair arms used in the Syndicate's own manufacturing facilities."

	description "A system of bays for tiny drones equipped with repairing equipment like soldering and bolting tools. Dozens of docks holding hundreds of drones lie throughout the ship, and the drones are small enough to safely work beneath the Quaernan's shields, providing exceptional hull repair. Additionally, the drones are able to clean corrosive substances from the ship's hull, reducing the severity of such attacks."
	description "Because the drones need power for things other than hull maintenance, the system is quite energy inefficient. Additionally, the engines used by the drones can impart a moderate amount of heat onto the ship due to the close proximity."
