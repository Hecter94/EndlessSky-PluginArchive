			`	Entering the chamber you are greeted with a larger audience than you were expecting. "We have heard of your efforts defending the planet of Allhome and we are honoured," says a rather elderly Hai, "but as we have business to discuss I will skip the formalities." Saying somewhat resigned, as though discussing hostilities causes them great distress, "Recently we have learnt of the source of these attacks, joint warlords that go by Gnar and Gash, they control the unfettered planet of Stormhold," now with even more resignation in its' voice, "Usually we deal with our situations internally however human space is outside of our jurisdiction, and I'm afraid several of our largest warships would stir up quite a panic. We regret to send you alone to deal with our matters given the risk, but we will compensate you greatly for your efforts."`

			`Landing here feels wrong, you feel as if you do not belong in such an intense place. You expect trouble being as it is a pirate controlled planet, but all the conflict you get are mere glances from the bulky, shady looking pirates. Searching for someone around here who can help you takes longer than expected. After being shoved off by several shady characters you finally find yourself in luck.`
			`	You may have just found exactly what you were looking for, a man in charge. By the mass of pirates surrounding the man and the way the crowd seems to try to avoid him you figure him for a local warlord. Shuffling up sort of nervously you hesitantly grab his attention and tell him that Baxter sent you.`
