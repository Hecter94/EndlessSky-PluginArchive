	description "The Cleanse is basically a weakened version of the Thetagins Deterge, by that it has slightly less shield and hull regeneration and of course does not use any Thetagin weaponry or outfits. But it should sill be strong enough to fight anything in the vanilla ES due to it still being a Tier 4(?) warship. Except maybe an Archon."
