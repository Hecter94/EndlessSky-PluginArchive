# Portraits for News in Endless Sky
This plugin re-activates the portrait system for news in ES. All the images for portraits are already in the game, but became unused after portraits for news was disabled by default. Alien portraits (including transhuman portraits) are not considered canon. Compatable for all news up to 0.9.13.
###### To install
It is highly recommended to use [ESLauncher2](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/ESLauncher2/releases/latest) to install this plugin. If you can't/don't want to install ESLauncher2, then you can install the plugin by unzipping it and placing it into ES's plugin folder.
