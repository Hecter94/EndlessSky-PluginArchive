This plugin re-activates the portrait system for news in ES. It includes all the portrait images that were in the game but became unused, and were later removed in 0.10.14. However, some portraits had to be added for news items after 0.9.12. Alien portraits (including transhuman portraits) are not considered canon. 
Compatable for most news up to 0.10.0.
