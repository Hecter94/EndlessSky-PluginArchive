# James, this weapon was considerably more powerful than the gatling gun - 180 hull damage per second, while the gatling gun does 120.
# This was because you had stopped it having to reload between bursts, so it could fire continuously.
# Overall it was firing 3x as many rounds in a set period of time, so even though each bullet did half the damage there were 3x as many fired.
# I have changed it as follows to make the hull damage half that of the gatling gun - 60 per second
# 	Returned it to firing in 180-round bursts, that take 3 seconds to reload (see "reload" and "burst reload" values), making it the same
#	Kept your bullet hull damage value of 3
#	Removed the "homing" effect (makes no sense for a bullet, homing is for guided missiles with sensors and a computer steering them)
# I have also fixed the spelling of "Shield" in many places.

# YOU NEED TO FIX YOUR SPELLING: shield, projectile and weapon
# Spelling is very important when coding. Talk to me if you don't understand why it matters.
# These words are in folder names, filenames (including this file), and the text of this file. You need to fix them in all places.
# It is very important to spell things correctly from the start. Fix this now, and you'll have to change only a few things.
#   But if you wait until you've actually made more projectiles and started referring to this outfit in more places, like ships, things would get very messy very fast!
