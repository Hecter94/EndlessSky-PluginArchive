			`You go to the room indicated, and are met by a group of monopods who are all unfamiliar to you, except for Tokani.`
			`	"Much has happened since your last visit <first>. We have a new government. These are new members of parliament and their staff.`
			`	"You may have noticed protestors around the airport when you last visited. When the war was won, most people were very happy with the idea of banishing the Yuhavi to Uca cevata. The people saw this as a fair punishment for what the Yuhavi had done.`
			`	"But when the Yuhavi suddenly had alien spaceships, many people began to question this. Many said it was a rash, arrogant decision. Uca cevata should not have been given away. The Yuhavi should not have been pushed to align with aliens.`
			`	"After Yuhavi bold visit to airport with new ships, and coronation of King Pagu, protests became riots. Lots of anger. Government would not admit they had done anything wrong, proud and arrogant. But they were forced to call a snap election, and lost."`
			choice
				`	Continue`
			`"New government believe we cannot isolate ourselves. Must interact with aliens, like Yuhavi. Must become space people also. And need peace with Yuhavi as equals, not as victors.`
			`	"Government want to ask your help, as you have helped Yuhavi. Will you help us?"`
			choice
				`	"I would be glad to."`
				`	"No, I just support the Yuhavi."`
					decline
			`"Thank you. Please take a small delegation to the nearest human government so we can establish secret diplomatic relations. `
			`	"The delegation will also seek to establish a banking relationship so we can trade in credits, to pay you and interact with other humans. The new government has already approved the use of credits for inter-planetary trade."`

			`During the trip, you contacted the Free Worlds parliament and requested a private diplomatic audience. After delicately explaining the situation while giving away as little information as possible, it was agreed a delegation would meet you in a private hanger at the spaceport.`
			`	You land outside the pre-arranged hanger, and the <ship> is pulled inside. Once inside you exit your ship and confirm the arrangements for the meeting. After being assured nobody will see, you call the monopod delegation to leave the <ship> and hop across to a private meeting room.`
			choice
				`	Continue.`
			`	The Free Worlds representatives are clearly both surprised and (embarrassingly) amused at the appearance of the monopods. They spend several hours in discussions on a wide range of topics. The situation is complicated by the Yuhavi's pre-existing relationship with Southbound and Kraz.`
			`	Finally the Free Worlds agree to exchange ambassadors, who will investigate the potential for a trading relationship, and banking arrangements are made also. The Free Worlds agree with the Monopod insistance upon secrecy.`
			`	A diplomat from the monopod delegation, already trained in the human language, will stay in Bourne as ambassador. Tokani gives him his old wheelchair disguise, and the Free Worlds promise to provide him a house with a large private gymnasium for exercise purposes.`
			`	A Free Worlds ambassador will travel back with you in his place, bringing a communication device that will utilise the relays already installed by Kraz for the Yuhavi.`

			`On landing, the Free Worlds ambassador hands you a credit chip for 50,000 credits, saying "Regular banking services will be established shortly, allowing you to be paid in credits."`
			`	Tokani adds "When pay on Imatai in gold, gold still on planet. But when pay you, gold lost. Better trade in pretend money and keep our gold." He laughs heartily at how silly this all seems to him.`

			`A monopod approaches you in the spaceport and introduces himself as a commodity trader. "Glad finally meet Captain <last>! Good news for you.`
			`	"After long negotiations with Imatai and Uca cevata governments, traders finally permission sell aliens. May buy sell food, metal and plastic now. Captain <last> want buy metal from honest trader?"`
			choice
				`	"Why can I only trade food, metal and plastic?"`
			`The trader shakes his head in frustration. "Both governments very worry security, want hide from aliens. Not allow us trade manufactured goods, as monopod goods different to alien, maybe suspicious. May trade raw materials - food, metal and plastic. And only simple processed foods - flour, sugar, oil - not unique fruit. But better than nothing!"`
			`	"Most welcome trading post any time. See Captain <last> soon?"`
			`	He hops away across the spaceport towards a group of warehouses.`
