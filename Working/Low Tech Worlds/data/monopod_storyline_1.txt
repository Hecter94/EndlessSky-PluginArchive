			`As you come to land on this strange planet you look down and see small human-like creatures running into buildings, and strange domes. As you look at the domes they turn around, revealing guns. They start shooting at you and the <ship>'s hull immediately starts sustaining damage, the projectiles appear to pass straight through your shields. You crash land in a clear area of ground surrounded by hedges.`
			choice
				`	Go to the window`
			`You go to the window and see that the people are nervously creeping back out of the buildings, looking at your ship and hiding again. They are about half as tall as a grown man, and each has only one leg with a large foot.`
			`	After waiting for some time at the window, you see no further movement, so decide to inspect the ship for damage.`
			`	You conduct all the investigations you can from inside the ship, not yet daring to venture outside. The engine appears to have sustained damage from the gunfire and you are unable to take off. You cannot know the precise damage without a closer inspection from outside the ship. Your sensors detect that the atmosphere of this planet is breathable, however the sun is already setting, and it may be unsafe to go out on an unknown alien planet after dark. After locking your doors you go to your bunk for a sleep.`
			choice
				`	Next day`
			`You get up in the morning and look out the window. There is a basket with a type of fruit or something on the ground outside. You also see that there are some aliens peeping over the bushes.`
			`	You open the door and look carefully around for any danger. You then quickly rush to the basket, pick it up, and rush back to the safety of the <ship>. You look at the fruit. It resembles a star.`
			choice
				`	Eat the fruit`
					goto eat
				`	Throw the fruit away`
			`You drop the fruit in your rubbish bin, and eat a meal from your stores.`
				goto breakfast
			label eat
			`You eat the fruit. It is soft on the outside but hard and crunchy on the inside, and past the crunchy part there is liquid. But its taste sticks out most. You rush to the toilet to be sick. You come back, nice and refreshed, and eat a proper meal from your stores.`
			label breakfast
			`	After breakfast, you cautiously exit the ship again, and inspect it for damage. It turns out that the gunfire made a lucky hit and damaged a crucial engine component. It would be easy to repair at a human outfitter, but will be extremely difficult and time consuming to repair while stranded on an alien world with only access to your emergency toolkit, if it is repairable at all. You realise that you are going to be stranded on this planet for some time.`
			`	You return to your ship to consider your next steps. Once you have come to grips with the enormity of the situation, you gradually become more and more aware of the momentous nature of your discovery of this planet. You have never heard even a single rumour of these systems or these aliens before, and realise you are probably the first human to ever discover them. This is so important that it really should be recorded, particularly given that you will be stuck on this planet for some time. You decide to start a diary. Finding an empty notebook, you record everything that has happened since you landed on the planet.`
			`	Realising the importance of getting to know the local inhabitants, you draw a quick picture of you and the aliens sitting down in a circle talking, hoping that this will tell them that you are friendly. Before going to bed, you put the picture you have drawn in the basket, with some chocolate, and put it down outside the door where you found it.`
			choice
				`	Continue`
			`Diary entry, day 3: `
			`	When I woke up today, six of these strange aliens were sitting in a circle outside my ship, as if waiting for something.`
			`	When I opened the door and left the ship, they all appeared frightened and eyed me suspiciously, especially my legs. We attempted to talk to each other using sign language. I think I was able to give them the impression that I was peaceful. I think they intend to return tomorrow.`
			`	These aliens are about two thirds the height of a human, with a very human-like upper body, but just one very muscular leg. They travel by jumping, and look like the monopods of old human stories. `
			`	The remainder of the day was spent beginning to dismantle my engine.`
			`	I have realised that I have another problem - hyperspace fuel. I will need to refuel before I can return to human space. I do not know whether this is available on this planet.`
			choice
				`	Continue`
			`Day 7:`
			`	For the past few days, every morning there has been a small group of monopod aliens sitting outside my ship. The number changes, but there is one monopod who is there every day, and who takes the lead in trying to talk to me. I am assuming he is male because of his long red beard, but most of the monopods I have seen have beards so it is possible that both genders have them. He has said several different words while pointing to himself. I am assuming one is his personal name and another is the name of their people, but I don't know which. Trying to communicate when you don't know the local language is very difficult! `
			`	They do like to eat chocolate. I have very little left.`
			`	I am making very slow progress on repairing my engine. `

					goto end
			`Day 15:`
			`	The main monopod speaking to me is named Tokani, and the collective name for their people is Skiapode. We are beginning to be able to communicate with a few phrases - he is learning my language faster than I am learning his. He appears to have a great sense of humour, and is fun to spend time with, despite the communication barrier.`
			`	Today I raced Tokani from one side of the clearing to the other. He has a higher top speed than me, however I can accelerate and turn faster, so overall we are evenly matched. Except that he can jump over my head almost effortlessly.`
			`	I have been able to repair most of the damage now, however there is one solid metal part that is beyond repair, and I will need to have a replacement manufactured. The monopods use various vehicles including aircraft, so must have the ability to manufacture the component that I need.`
			`	I have decided my primary need is to build my ability to communicate with the monopods, and to ensure that they see me as a friend and will be willing to help me.`

					goto end
			`Day 30:`
			`I have now spent two weeks completely focussed on building my relationship with Tokani and learning to communicate. Although I still know only a few phrases of his language, he is able to talk to me in mine as well as a human toddler would.  `
			`	Tokani's children were very scared of me when I first met them (only one is taller than my knee), but soon came to accept me. The real breakthrough came when one of the children kicked a ball up a tree, and was very upset. I climbed the tree to get it down, and they were all amazed to see somebody climbing a tree. Although they can jump well, they find climbing extremely difficult and almost never even attempt it. The children now look at me like I am some sort of superhero. `
			`	But I do look ridiculous when climbing the stairs - or what I call the stairs. The ceilings in monopod houses are about the same height as human ceilings, because although they are short they jump instead of walking, and their heads would hit the ceiling if it were any lower. Their houses usually have two or more floors, but instead of stairs they have a single large step halfway between the floor and ceiling. They simply jump up onto this step, then straight onto the next floor. I have to haul myself up using my arms, which looks ridiculous and the children laugh hysterically at me every time.`
			`	Tonight I think we are going out to some sort of formal dinner.`

					goto end
			`Day 31a:`
			`	We did go to a formal dinner last night. Many monopods were there, some of whom I had never seen before and appeared to be in authority. I was seated with them, at a seat and table that appeared to have been specially made for the occasion to allow me to sit at the same level as them. `
			`	After the meal Tokani and myself had a long, slow conversation with these leaders. They confirmed that they are the rulers of this planet. I was able to explain that I came from a long way away, and point out my home star Rutilicus on a star map. They indicated that they have aircraft, and have put unmanned satellites in orbit around their planet. But they had never even travelled to their own moon. `
			`	They want to visit the <ship> today. I am hoping they will be bringing an engineer, so I can show them the part I need repaired.`
			`	At the start of the meal I was presented with another one of the star fruits that I had received on my first day at the ship. This appeared to be a very special honour, as nobody else had one, and everybody watched me to see what I would do with it. The taste was revolting, but I ate a small corner of it. This appeared to please everyone, and they started eating their own food after that. Tokani's older children were nervously moving around helping serve the food, and I saw them eyeing my uneaten star fruit. When nobody seemed to be looking I sneakily passed the fruit to one of them, and she looked very surprised and excited. She hid it in her clothing and raced off. When we returned to Tokani's home, the child I had given the fruit to cut it up and carefully gave some to everybody in the family, including Tokani and his wife. Tokani explained that these fruits were extremely rare and valuable, the children had never tasted them before, and he had only eaten one once. I indicated that they made me feel sick, and he first looked offended, and then started laughing uncontrollably.`

			`Day 31b:`
			`	Tokani and I returned to the <ship> in the morning. After we arrived, monopods wearing plain clothing and facescarves arrived in groups of two or three. We brought each group on board when they arrived. Once on board, they took off their head coverings and turned out to be the officials I had spoken to at the dinner the night before, plus some others. I asked Tokani about why they wore disguises, and he just replied "Safety".`
			`	The monopods asked to fly, and I told them no, and showed them the damage from their guns. I showed them the broken part, and an undamaged one off the other side of the ship, and one monopod whom I am hoping is an engineer took both pieces away with him.`
			`	The monopods left again as before, in disguise and in small groups.`

			`Day 43:`
			`	Tokani is now able to communicate with me fairly fluently. It turns out that he is an expert in linguistics, who usually teaches languages at something like a university. When I landed he was immediately given leave from his teaching job in order to focus full-time on learning to communicate with me. His top students are already beginning to study my language also.`
			choice
				`	Continue to the last diary entry`
			label end
			`Day 57:`
			`	Today the engineer returned with an almost perfect replica of the broken part. I was so happy when I saw it I unexpectedly started to cry - the fact I might actually be able to get off this planet again suddenly made me realise how much I missed talking to other humans.`
			`	However, one of the leaders was with him, and they made it clear that they would give me the part on condition that I did some jobs for them. They wish to explore their solar system.`
			`	I explained that I could do this, if they could refill my tanks with hyperspace fuel so I could return to human space afterwards. I was able to print out a chemical formula for the fuel, and the engineer also took a sample from the dregs left in my tanks and sent it with a messenger to a nearby laboratory. The engineer and I then repaired the engine while we awaited a response about the hyperspace fuel. Later that afternoon they confirmed that they do have that compound available, but as they do not produce it in large quantities it is expensive.`
			`	We agreed that I would take a trip to their moon in exchange for repairing my engine, and if I took a trip to the other planet in their system they would also refill my hyperspace fuel tanks.`
			`	The scientist who will accompany me to the moon is named Kena. He cannot speak my language, but with Tokani's help we have a good plan for the trip and should not need to talk to do the job. We will also be taking 5 tonnes of sensors.`

			`A group of 5 monopods is waiting for you in the spaceport: Tokani, one of the planet leaders you met earlier, and three you do not recognise. Tokani translates "Before you arrived on planet, believed we alone in space. Space aliens like yourself thought to be just stories. Your landing was big surprise, which is why army shot down your ship (which we sorry for). We very happy that you friendly, and thank for how you already help us.`
			`	"We want build ships like yours. If you bring technology we can use, and learn from, we pay you well. `
			`	"But know that there must be many more aliens like you. There are good people and bad people, so there must be good aliens and bad aliens. We do not want the bad aliens to know about us.`
			`	"Can you keep our planet a secret?"`
			choice
				`	"I can certainly keep you a secret, but I cannot guarantee my crew will."`
				`	"I am very excited about discovering these planets, and do not think I will be able to keep it a secret, I am sorry."`
			`Tokani translates your reply, and the other monopods look worried and frustrated. After some discussion among themselves, Tokani says "That is very disappointing, but we pleased you were honest. Now we really need get more technology, to be prepare in case others find us, try harm us."`
			`	Tokani asks about simple human ships, and you describe shuttles, sparrows and star barges to him. You also discuss engine systems. Finally, you discuss weaponry, and the monopods are extremely interested in lasers. They already have shield-penetrating projectile weapons, but have not been able to master weapons-strength lasers, which they see as being most useful for defence, especially for anti-missile and anti-drone systems. They settle on a list of equipment that they would like to acquire initially, and place it in your job board.`
			`	"Please remember we will usually want two of each outfit" says Tokani. "One to test, one to pull apart and study.". You do not have to install these on your ship, if you click the "Show outfits in cargo" checkbox in the outfitter you can buy outfits directly into your cargo hold.`
			`	"How would you like to be paid for these jobs?"`
			choice
				`	"In credits"`
			`You explain the electronic credits that are used for interplanetary commerce in the remainder of the galaxy.`
			`	"What are credits based upon?" asks Tokani.`
			`	"They are just credits. I really don't know much about them, we've just always used them and I have never thought about it deeply." you reply.`
			`	"Here, use gold and silver as money" Tokani explains. "We have electronic money also, but this simply represents the silver you have in the bank. Real money is silver, the electronic version just saves carrying heavy bags around. If credits represent nothing, they must be 'fiat' currency. Many years ago we used fiat currencies, but found too easily manipulated by bad banks and governments. Fiat currencies are now illegal. We can only trade things of real value - gold, silver, and other precious items."`
			`	After further discussion among themselves, Tokani informs you that they cannot use credits, because they are not set up to use them, but also because it would be illegal, and this would need to be discussed in their parliament. Even if their parliament wanted to make an exception for you, this would not happen quickly.`
			`	"For now, when you do job, we pay gold or precious stones, or sometimes give you other goods you can sell" Tokani finally tells you. "You can then sell them for credits when you return to alien space."`
			`	Remember to check the job board.`

			`	"Our planet used to be divided into many different countries, with their own governments. Wars were frequent. Over time, small countries joined together to become larger countries, through conquest or peaceful agreements, until eventually the majority of the world was ruled by one government - our own". Tokani motions towards the government leader who is with him. "But there were still some small countries not under this government."`
			`	"As long as the planet was divided, there was a risk of war. Because we are a democracy, we had a global vote on whether to have a single, global government. The vote was open to everybody, although some independent countries prevented their people from voting. Fortunately 80% of the world's population were already under our government and were able to vote, and 75% of those voted for a global government. That meant that 60% of the world's population had voted to have a single global government - a very clear democratic result."`
			`	"From that day forward, all 'countries' ceased to exist by the will of the people, and our government has officially ruled the entire world, democratically."`
			`	"Unfortunately, some of the rulers of those former countries refused to accept the new government, and fought against the people of the world. They have committed terrible acts. Thousands of innocent civilians died. Some of these groups were quickly defeated, but one - the Yuhavi - has been fighting the people for years."`

			`	"But what about the 40% of the world who did not want global government?"`
			`	"We expect many of them would have actually wanted global government also, but their local governments refused to let them vote. We rescued them from these oppressive governments and gave them democracy, so they can have a say in the future of the planet. Yes, there were some people who genuinely disagreed and did not want global government, but they were outvoted. That is how democracy works."`

			`"The cowardly Yuhavi were not just fighting our soldiers, but were fighting innocent civilians. One of their most common ways to attack was to send unmanned drones, filled with explosives, and use them to blow up anything - military facilities, or even shopping centres. We had no effective way of stopping this. We have energy shields, and used those to protect the most important military targets, but could not put shields around every shopping centre. So the murder continued."`
			`	"But when you brought us laser weapons, we could finally build anti-drone defence systems. Taking the anti-missile defence turrets you provided as a model, we built our own turrets. We then mounted the laser rifles you brought us onto these turrets, resulting in low-powered but very fast defence systems that were powerful enough to shoot down drones. I understand you brought over 50 laser rifles - a small number were used for research, but most were actually used to make these anti-drone defences."`
			`	"These turrets were placed on mobile, shield-protected vehicles, and suddenly deployed to surround any site the rebels were sending drones from. With this we were able to elimininate their main weapon."`
			`	"Our brave army was then able to quickly defeat them before they had recovered and developed a new strategy. The fighting was still fierce and many soldiers died, but it was worth it, as this was the last war, that will end all war on this planet. We can now look forward to peace."`

If we tried to live alongside them, individuals would try and take revenge for the death of their relatives, and the planet would have many years of murderous acts that our security forces would struggle to prevent. This could even turn into another war."`
			`	"But the government has found a brilliant solution. We will deport them all - to Uca Cevata. This will save their lives from revenge attacks, and give us global peace."`

I will not bring her here openly - the crowd might harm her - but I can send her to your ship later in disguise. `
			`	"She can guide you to their former capital city, where their king is under house arrest in his palace. You can land at the king's private airfield on the palace grounds." Tokani says the last sentance with a sarcastic tone, obviously disgusted at the unnecessary luxury of having a palace with a private airfield.`
			`	Some hours after you return to your ship, a small hooded figure hops up to the ship. You quietly open the door and let her in. When she drops her hood, she looks almost identical to any other monopod woman - you cannot see why her ethnic group is so recognisable. But you are not a monopod.
