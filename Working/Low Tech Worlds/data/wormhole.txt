# Premise of missions:
# Wormhole is unstable and unreliable. The player needs to find a quantum keystone to stabilise the wormhole (with which the player will be able to travel through it at all times)
# Future: Need to disable the dialogs below if the player has a quantum keystone.

# If the player has found a quantum keystone before going through all of the below storyline, all should be disabled and the wormhole permanently locked for simplicity
# This should occur only if the player lands on a planet in Itikotiko with a keystone. A player may acquire one elsewhere but not know its usefulness yet. But if they arrive in Itikotiko they have most likely used it to get there.

			`	You are very excited about your discoveries through the Katuba wormhole, but feel lucky to have made it back to human space, since the wormhole is so unstable. Would you like to try and find somebody on <origin> who could help you to understand this wormhole?`
			choice
				`	Yes`
				`	No`
					defer
			`	After asking around the spaceport, you find that the best option will be to approach an astrophysical researcher at the local university.`
			`	The university is an enormous campus with many buildings. You look up the astrophysics department and walk to the appropriate building. The receptionist seems surprised and confused by your request to speak to "somebody who knows about wormholes", asks you to sit down, and makes a few telephone calls.`
			`	After waiting for about an hour, a man wearing an open-necked shirt and carrying several books comes out of a doorway, looks around, and approaches you.`
			`	"Are you the captain who was asking about wormholes?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, that's me."`
			`	"Right, I'm on my way to a lecture on the other side of campus, if you walk with me I'll try and answer your questions on the way."`
			`	The man immediately turns his back on you and walks briskly to the door. You run to catch up and start walking alongside him. He is clearly in a hurry and it is hard to keep up.`
			`	"What do you know about the wormhole in the Katuba system?", you ask.`
			`	"What wormhole? Oh, do you mean the ion cloud? It does look a bit like the entrance to a womhole. It's just a cloud. Is that all?"`
			`	"It is a wormhole, I just went through it."`
			`	The man stops in his tracks and turns to look at you. "Are you joking?"`
			choice
				`	"No, certainly not."`
				`	"Yes, I just waited by your reception for an hour just to tell a joke."`
			`	"I have known about that cloud for many years but nobody has ever claimed it is a wormhole. Why did you try and go into it?"`
			`	"Because I am adventurous" you say.`
			`	"And what happened when you entered the cloud?`
			`	"It felt like travelling through a hyperspace jump, but when I came out the other end I was in a system I had never seen before and which did not appear on any map I have seen."`
			`	"If this is correct, it is an incredible discovery. Can we go and see it immediately?"`
			`	"I thought you had a class to teach."`
			`	"They'll just think I broke my leg or something, they'll manage. Let's go! Oh, my name's Paul by the way."`
			`	"Mine is <first>."`
			`	You take Paul immediately to your ship.`

			`	Paul angrily shouts at you "You were lying the whole time. You made me cancel days of classes and head off on a wild goose chase with you, all for no reason. Do you think this is funny? Did one of my students put you up to this? I should have you arrested."`
			`	"I was not lying. I really did pass through the wormhole. However, it seems to be unstable. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. Maybe it would be working if we returned again."`
			`	"Do you think I am a fool? Don't try that on me"`
			`	"Honestly, the wormhole exists. It seems to be locked right now, but I know it is real. Have you ever heard of a wormhole that is sometimes open and sometimes locked?"`
			`	"No. That's not how they work."`
			`	"But if it was how they worked, how would you unlock it?"`
			`	Paul looks at you angrily. "With a key, of course".`
			`	You excitedly pull out a notebook and ask "What kind of a key?"`
			`	"A sciency sounding key. A nano key, or a quantum key. Put nano or quantum before anything and it sounds scientific. Yeah, you need one of those."`
			`	"Where would I find one?"`
			`	"In your lavatory. Go stick your head down it and see what you can see."`
			`	Paul pushes his way through the door and slams it in your face. You are unsure whether to pay any attention to what he said, he seems to be just trying to send you on a wild goose chase to punish you for taking him on one.`
