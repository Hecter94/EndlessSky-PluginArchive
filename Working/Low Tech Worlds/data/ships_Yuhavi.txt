	description "The Fury is Southbound Shipyards' most popular design of escort ship. They have greater firepower than any other interceptor-class vessel, meaning that any pirate flying solo will think twice before attacking a convoy that is accompanied by a Fury. However, Furies are also much less maneuverable than other small ships."
