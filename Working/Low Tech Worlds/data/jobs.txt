# ESCORT JOBS FAILING
# If use ship variant, e.g. "Clipper keystone", job never shows.
# BUT if use base ship, e.g. "Clipper", job comes up but cannot be completed as the ship cannot cross the wormhole.

# PAYMENTS PROBLEM
# Payments are not calculated correctly using the usual formula of multiplier * jumps * passengers & cargo, when crossing wormhole. Works fine within Itikotiko.
# Possibly the game is unable to calculate the number of jumps due to the wormhole, so makes an error?
# Temporary workaround: Making the base payment (first number) enough to be reasonable for any job. Not a good solution as payment doesn't differ with different sized cargos.
