# Monopod people 1, initially, do not trade in credits. You will however want payment for jobs for them.
# They can pay by one of the following:
# 1) Giving you small quantities of precious metals (e.g. gold) or jewels, which can be sold on human worlds for credits.
#    This will take no cargo space. It may be able to be done as a single mission.
# 2) Giving you commodities, to be sold full-price on human worlds. These should be raw materials (metals & plastics), not manufactured goods which would be identifiable as having an alien origin.
#    Two options for doing this:
#    2a: Give a job to take X tonnes of commodity to a specific human planet, to sell. Payment is roughly equivalent to the value of that commodity on that planet.
#        Job should be able to be deferred, and remain on the job board until you have cargo space free to take it.
#    2b: Simply give you X tonnes of a certain commodity.
#        Conceptually simpler but may be harder to code. Also may be unable to defer it to a later date if cargo hold too small or already full.
#    This would need to be a second mission that was made available after the first job was completed.

# Example jobs

# 1) Payment with precious metals / jewels.
