					`	As you enter the bar, you see your friend Tokani sitting at the back, drinking that awful drink... Ugh! It makes your stomach lurch even to think about it! you order a small bite to eat then go and sit next to Tokani. you start talking together for a bit,until Tokani finishes his mug. he looks at you, then quietly whispers to you, "Wait a moment and then follow me out." He then hops to the front of the room, hands in his mug, and walks out the door. this all seems very suspicious but you do as Tokani said. when you walk out the door you see him standing a we bit away, he becans to you. You follow him to a building on the outskirts of the town. It has guards posted in all the doorways. and you enter it through a hidden back door. you are soon following Tokani through a labrenth of hallways, going somwhere you do not know.`

					`	Soon you enter a large room with a table in the middle. there are half a dozen monopods seated around it. "Here's the space alien." Tokani says to the other monopods. Most of them look in amusement and interest at your two legs... something you've gotten used to by now. You are shown to a seat, you sit down. one of the monopods starts to speak. `
					`	"Space Alien. we have heard of your landing on our planet and are very exited to learn about all this new technolegy you have brought us. would you be willing to help us advance and be able to do much more things then we are able to do now?`

					`	"What are these for?" they ask you.`
					`	"These are sheilds, and they absorb the impact from other ship's guns which are trying to shoot you."`
					`	"Why would other space planes be trying to shoot you?"`
					`	"They might be pirates trying to steal your stuff, or they might be the enamy if you are in the middle of a war."`
					`	"Ahh!" They say, and keep looking round your ship.`
					`	They are also very interested in the life support systems and the engines. After a while of them looking and you explaining things, they done their clocks and hop out the door.`

					`	Would you be willing to take one of us into space?"
					choice
							`	Wait. I can see where this is leading, and if I'm going to work with you like this, I might need a place to refuel...`
								goto fuel
					label done
					`	"Good." The monopods say. "We have allways wanted to explore our solar system and have only ever looked at it through telescopes. could you first take up a scientist. he would take measurments and make better use of his time then any of us.
					choice
							`	Okay.`
								goto ready
					label fuel
					`	The monopods frown. "We saw what fuel you use in your space plane, and it isn't cheap... But if you do this job for us well, then we could set up a place for you to refuel.

					`	The next morning you wake up to the sound of some-one banging on <ship>'s door.
					`	"JUST A MOMENT!" you yell as you quickly start to get dressed.
					`	A minute or so later you answer the door. A very enthusiastic monopod jumps into your ship.
					`	"Hello Space Alien!" He says. "My name is Kena Galala, pleased to meet you!"
					` 	"You to." you say. "I expect that you are the scientist who is acompanying me into space."
					`	The monopod nods entusiasticly. "Of course I am! Leave as soon as you can!"
					`	You smile. "Okay."

He takes some measurements but mostly he looks out the cocpit at his home planet in amazment. then suddenly he says to you, 'I wonder if we could land on Uca cevata, the other planet in our solar system, could you take me there?'

Kena Galala, though, seems to find it the most exiting thing in the world, landing on another planet. You go out and collect some rock for him. after a long time he finaly tells you that it's time to go back home.`
