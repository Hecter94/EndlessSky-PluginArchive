# People groups

Planet populated by two people groups, A and B (to be named).

## People A

Democracy ruling most of the world. Gradually formed over time by amalgamation of all smaller governments into one large global democracy. 

Proud at their achievement of near-total world rule, and their own technology. Have single-use space rockets, satellites, and have sent robotic probes to an adjacent planet to gather basic information - similar technology level to humans in 21st century. Initially, their entire focus is their own world - they wish to conquer the last remaining holdout not in their democracy, to achieve global peace and an end to all war. As they know of no populated planets or alien species other than their own, they have never even considered the possibility of other species, or colonising other planets.

They consider themselves the rightful rulers of the entire world, as they believe in democracy and the right of the people of their planet to decide their future by voting. The majority of the planet support the concept of one-world government, and have voted for it by joining the union and in every election since. Majority rules - so they have a democratic mandate to rule the whole world. The opinion of the minority who want their own small nations is irrelevant, because the world has voted and decided to unify.

They view People B as evil terrorists, who are opposing democracy and preventing peace, and whose battle tactic is to blow up civilians in order to scare People A into stopping fighting them. People B have killed thousands of civilians. Initially People A wanted to have People B peacefully join their union, but now that a war has begun and People B have committed so many atrocities there is no solution but to conquer People B with force. All the citizens now hate People B so much they would never want to live alongside them, and if they tried there would probably be violence and revenge attacks.

No interest in "credits", all trade using precious metals, no need to set up a whole new banking system just to trade with "one alien" (you).

## People B

Small kingdom that does not want to join People A. As all others joined the union, they became increasingly isolated. When People A decided they had a democratic mandate to rule the whole world (by force if necessary), they fought back. However as they have far fewer people than People A, they could not win a head-on war. So they resorted to terror tactics, and technology. No space travel, completely focussed on on-planet military technology. Experts at robotic systems, suicide drones, cyberwarfare, fast transportation. Great expertise - but losing the war through lack of resources and personal. Simply cannot sustain a military campaign like this.

Ruled by a king, organised under a strict efficient heirarchy. Some people want democratic rule, and the war is causing some to turn against the king.

# First contact, & outcome of the war

You land in the territory controlled by People A. After learning the language (and in the process teaching a small number of them your language), you transport scientists from People A to adjacent planets / moons to explore. You also fetch small ships & outfits for them, and educational materials, to boost their spaceship development. 

People A develop a basic, shuttle-sized multipurpose transport ship.

People A find that their adjacent planet 2 is colonisible, but not as good as planet 1 - smaller, lower gravity, weaker atmosphere, colder, would only grow the sorts of plants they grow in mountain regions. They have little interest in it themselves - they have a good planet already.

But they decide it would be ideal to banish People B to, solving their problem permanently and "humanely", without having to kill everyone.

They conquer People B. State all their property now belongs to People A. Give them the option of leasing back their own land from People A at an exhorbitant price (to pay back for the cost of the war), or leave and settle on planet 2. Very harsh outcome. Give People B a very short transition period before their land will be completely taken over (say 10 years). Allow People B to rent their early spaceships for transport (which they have to borrow money to do, putting them in debt to People A).

People B very upset at their king, who had led the military in the war - but they like the crown prince, as he was in charge of industry & agriculture, and managed to organise this efficiently even through great hardship. Risk of revolution - but that would be expensive in money and lives and still wouldn't change the situation. Pragmatic acceptance among the people that lean efficiency of the monarchy may be needed at this time just as much as in a war. Cunning political move by the king - he appoints Crown Prince as King of planet 2. States that he will rule the remaining people on planet 1 during the transition period given in the terms of surrender, then abdicate if he has not already died.

Crown Prince (now the king) immediately appoints well-liked people as advisers and subrulers. Now people want to migrate to be ruled by the new king, and are not immediately desperate for democracy as most of the people they would have elected are already in government in some form.

# Colonisation of planet 2

People B now have a planet, but no money and few resources. Not a single spaceship. No way of colonising it at all, and a tight timeframe to do it in. They decide they need outside help.

- Help them form a basic colony, with scientists and surveyers to map and plan the land, and to be the immediate home of the new King who is demonstrating his dedication to the planet by immediately moving there. Using People A's ships as transport shuttles.
- Discuss options. Take secret delegation to human shipyard (Southbound?) to form secret commercial relationship.
- Joint venture with shipyard - together set up manufacturing capability on planet 2, shipyard to supply transport ships, people B to provide all raw materials they can mine plus all labour, supplying key components to shipyard to reduce reliance on Syndicate. As people B will have access to shipyard technology, to prevent IP theft agreement includes clause that they are forbidden from developing any ships or outfits independently of shipyard, all new tech is property of shipyard for next 50 years.
- Set up banking facilities, allowing trading, outfitter and shipyard. 
- Stop using People A's ships, as human ones are better and supplied anyway as part of joint venture. Using shuttles, and transports with bunkrooms from chosen shipyard. Eventually they might purchase a Star Queen, or multiple ones, which you would fetch and escort to them.

This means that planet 2 will only sell human ships and not develop alien ships - but will immediately have many ships available for sale. Immediately leaping ahead of people A in technology - but also hamstringing own future development.

Need Hai or Remnant keystones in bulk. Also need convoy escorts, people transport from planets 1-2, and transport for various secret delegations and other missions. Collect manufacturing equipment from all over human space, including discarded equipment from Syndicate upgrades sold as scrap, to help build manufacturing capacity.

Also source unique agricultural species from cold worlds to allow food production.

Rapid, successful colonisation, people far more prosporous than before and have hope for the future, cementing rule of new king. 

# People A react

People A now find that rather than reducing People B to impoverished outcasts, People B suddenly have space travel, an entire planet of their own, and a navy that is tiny by human standards (maybe one Fury) but could shoot down every ship and satellite they own whenever they liked. They've already rejected the spaceships People A were so proud of as obsolete - which is taken as a major embarrassment. People B cannot rule planet 1, but could imprison and oppress People A. 

Realisation that the terms placed on People B were too harsh - so harsh that they forced People B to seek support from humans. Had been driven by emotion, political grandstanding and pride without considering the consequences. The terms of the surrender have set the stage for possible future war. Many thinkers want to avoid this.

(This is similar to the situation between Germany and France after WW1. France (and the other allies) seized disputed territory from Germany and placed incredibly harsh financial penalties on Germany, forcing them to pay for the cost of the war. The result was that Germany ended up determined to right these wrongs, elected a dictatorial government, grew economically much faster than other Western powers, becoming a great force again, resulting in WW2.)

Massive political upheaval, random assassinations etc, complete change of government.

New government wants to engage with outside world to catch up with people B and surpass them again.

- Quickly adapt ships to fight if necessary. Basic small fighter & suicide drone options.
- Set up banking - can finally trade in credits.
- Start sales of early ships (previously you had helped develop but couldn't buy)
- Seek new technology and educational material to inform own development. Bring them technology from all over human and hai space - but not from shipyard associated with People B, who are contractually obliged not to deal with them.
- Rapid development of new ships and outfits.
- Exploration of adjacent star systems.
- Colonisation of at least one other planet, using their own ships and technology.

Will there be fighting between the two peoples, in space? Not sure yet.

# Pirate threat

Pirates discover the wormhole. After a devastating battle they win with your help but would have lost on their own, peoples A and B form a limited, suspicious alliance to guard the wormhole with a joint fleet and destroy or capture any unidentified ships travelling through.

Goal: Any ship entering the wormhole never returns. From the outside, nobody dares to enter. They don't even know if it's a real wormhole or if it is an anomaly that just tears ships to pieces.

Once inside, captured humans can live freely on the world of the people that captured them, but can never return to human space unless they prove themselves trustworthy like yourself and can maintain the secret.

# Notes on plot elements

## Money

It is not realistic for all alien species to automatically accept the same electronic "credits" as money which humans use. They need a reason to accept this fiat currency.

New aliens use sound money - precious metals - for their own trading. They also are familiar with banks as repositories for metals, and banknotes and electronic transactions. However, it is all backed by precious metals. They are skeptical of "credits" which are backed by nothing.

Initially they pay you in physical precious metals, which you take to a human world to sell. The final stage in all paid jobs is to land on a human world to "exchange your precious metals for credits", at which point you are paid.

This is not sustainable as it would result in draining local stores of precious metals through a trade imbalance. Same problem Europe had with China in the 19th century - Europeans were paying in silver to buy tea and china from China, but little silver was returning, so China was becoming richer. The solution there was opium - England pushed opium into China, which was paid for in silver, returning silver to England. This was very unpopular with the Chines government, and resulted in the opium wars, where England won and subdued China.

Two-way trade is required. And all other civilisations use "credits" for this trade. So they must learn about credits and open local accounts to receive them - at least for international exchange, no need to use them domestically.

Solution:

- Take delegation to human space to start financial relationship, while retaining secrecy. This MAY involve exchange of ambassadors, or be on an interbank level only.
- Open "trading" a few weeks / months after returning delegation.
- Open spaceport and outfitters once products available to sell (depends upon other jobs).

## Secrecy

New aliens do not wish to advertise their presence to all space. 

- Few delegations to human space. None elsewhere.
- These few delegates & traders disguise themselves using wheelchairs.
- Human ships used for intergalactic commerce.
- Eventually - heavy guard on wormhole, all unknown ships entering destroyed
