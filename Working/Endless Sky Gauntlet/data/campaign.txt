			"Your final approach towards Kaeyin's abandoned spaceport reveals that you aren't the only recent visitor this serene, vacant planet has seen. Half-reclaimed by vegetation, a long furrow has been plowed into the turf, terminating in a glittering, silvery wreck a few meters away from an entirely pristine landing pad. The crash is a tragically recognizable pattern, seen hundreds of times by anyone who's tuned into New Boston's news networks; a ship that's survived re-entry only to fail to engage any sort of landing thrusters leaves a scar in the earth exactly like this one. The wreckage, though twisted, seems to about roughly equal in size to a Navy gunboat."
			choice
				"	Stop and investigate the ship"
				"	Mark its location and carry on"
					go to "later"
			"The alien vessel crashed attempting to reach a landing pad a few meters from its now-ruined prow. This makes finding an appropriate parking spot a conveniently simple matter."
			"Entering the ship proves a similarly simple matter. Its introduction to the planet's soil led to a long, rolling crash along stony terrain, rendering the hull ripped open in multiple locations. Despite the violence and apparent speed of its entry, the ship's surface appears to be entirely immaculate, much like the surrounding buildings and spaceport infrastructure - though the overall aesthetic appears entirely dissimilar from anything else you've seen on this strange world."
			choice
				"	Enter a breach in the ship's hull"
					go to "entry"
				"	Scrutinize one of the damaged sections more closely"
			"Although any soot, dirt, or even dust appears to have been scoured from the ship's twisted, gleaming hull, the metal surrounding this particular breach bears a disproportionate level of heat-stain compared to other damaged spots. Unless you're mistaken, this particular wound was inflicted upon the ship while it was still in space - and was only further opened by its rolling crash-landing."
			choice
				"	Proceed carefully into the jagged tear"
			label "entry"
			"The unlit interior of the ship is, thankfully, nowhere near as chrome-plated as its exterior, enabling you to actually navigate by flashlight without blinding yourself."
			"Either the ship's previous occupants were particularly spartan, or any loose objects in the room had been sucked out into space before landing. A foam rectangle roughly a meter square is securely fastened to one of the walls, while a low desk, complete with a smaller foam pad before it in a configuration suggesting a seat, occupies the opposite wall."
			choice
				"	Carry on into the corridor"
					go to "corridor"
				"	Test out the furniture"
			"Whether driven by sudden fatigue, academic curiosity, or pure whimsy, you decide to take a seat on the alien bunk. The foam is firm enough to cradle you, but lusciously soft. Lean in close and press your cheek to the bunk; there's a subtle, soothing scent that seems to rise from the material. It's clearly more luxurious than any standard cot on a human vessel. Unfortunately, there's no way you're going to fit your entire body onto the cot without curling up into the fetal position. Best to keep moving.
				choice
				"	Carry on into the corridor"
			label "corridor"
			"Entry into the ship's central corridor is blocked by an emergency bulkhead. Getting past it would be impossible, but impact with the planet's surface has warped the ship's frame sufficiently for you to squeeze past."
			"	The ship is evidently a single-deck design, slanted at a dangerous angle on account of the unconventional landing. The first thing you notice, however, is the cabin right across from you."
			Similarly sealed with an emergency bulkhead, the heavy door appears to've crushed an unfortunate alien. An assemblage of bones contained within a transluscent, dessicated skin like the sheddings of a serpent protrude from under the pressure door - any muscle or connective tissue present must have decayed long ago, leaving only these remains. Within a large skin-sack which you can only presume to be the head a skull rests. Inhumanly large eye-sockets gaze up at you, far too late to plead for aid. The jaw appears to terminate in a small, hooked beak far more reminiscent of an octopus than any avian."
			"	Perhaps of more interest to an avaricious eye is the sizeable crystal clutched within the corpse's embrace. Composed of the same material as the quantum keystones found in Hai and Remnant space, this chicken-sized crystal has been cut to precise geometric angles and apparently tooled - though it's hard to discern on account of the multitude of cracks running alongs its surface. You don't have to be an expert to know that it's damaged."
			choice
				"	Take the stone"
			"To your right appears to be the vessel's control center - as well as any loose objects that were in the ship at the time of its crash, all having been shunted by the impact to settle at the lowest point. Unfortunately, this includes significant amounts of rubble. It would take an excavation crew to penetrate further in that direction."
			"To your left is a sealed door, a lever hooded in a plastic safety cover next to it - fairly standard placement for a portal's emergency override. Of some concern might be the fact that the lever's painted in an obnoxiously bright shade of purple, with large alien letters and a pictogram that looks exactly like the alien skull you'd just seen."
			choice
				"	Go left. Raise the plastic cover and pull the lever beneath."
				"	The stone is enough. Time to leave."
					go to "end"
			"Perhaps you hesitate for a few moments after raising the safety cover; perhaps you question the decisions that led you to the dim interior of an alien vessel, about to pull a lever clearly marked with a skull. Perhaps you don't mull over these things at all, because you clearly weren't thinking things through when you chose this course of action."
			"There's a hiss, a click, and lights flicker overhead as emergency power systems hum back into life. After a few seconds the sealed door before you begins to unlock with a cacophonous grinding of restraining bolts sliding free. Light spills from beneath as wounded motors struggle to drag the heavy metal slab back into a stowed position."
			"Wind whips at your ankles as the atmosphere's pressure equalizes with the interior. You take a step back to await the door's full unsealing, only to find an unexpected companion coming along for the ride. Bony fingers clad in transluscent skin cling to your foot, reaching out from within the room you'd just unsealed."
			choice
				"Remain calm and shake the limb loose"
			"A moment of analysis reveals that you've been seized by a corpse leaned up against the inside of the door - and that it wasn't the only one. A multitude of skins-and-bones litter the chamber beyond, most of them having died while struggling in vain to open the very door you've now unsealed. In the center of the chamber a polyhedral core lurks, its faces spiderwebbed with fractures. Each and every body within the room seems to've found its end while struggling to get as far away from the core as possible."
			choice
			"	Perhaps the skeletons have a point. A prompt retreat and emergency decontamination are in order."
				go to "safe"
			"	Your curiosity knows no limits. Enter the chamber and learn what you can."
			"Can you be so unwise? Are you truly so desperate for knowledge that any semblance of good sense has taken its leave? There is nothing within this chamber but death. You stoop towards the core to try to glean some understanding of its construction, but a growing wave of nausea renders you unable to focus on anything but attempting to make your way towards safer territory. Falteringly you stumble through the ship's slanted corridor; first bile, then blood sully the pristine decking as you void your stomach's contents upon the reactor core's threshold. Herculean effort allows you to lurch into the alien cabin, but you never make it beyond and off the ship. The struggle to remain conscious becomes too much to bear, and our lifeless body joins the others littering the vessel."

			"After a thorough cleansing, a medical scan reveals that you're suffering from minor radiation poisoning. Luckily, you were able to escape before its effects became irreversible."
			label "end"
			"Back in the comfort of your ship you examine your prize. One alien keystone, clearly damaged. Perhaps Remnant scientists could find some use for it."
