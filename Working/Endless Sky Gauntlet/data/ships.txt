	description "A dedicated interdictor, the Gorgon is built around a spinally-mounted tractor beam. Standard doctrine is that the Gorgon is to be deployed to screen cruisers from harassment by anything heavier than an interceptor, but which the cruisers struggle to target with their capital-grade weapons."
	description "A generous allotment of bunks and the tractor beam make the Gorgon a popular choice for pursuit operations. A target can be caught, disabled, and then overwhelmed with marines in short order."
