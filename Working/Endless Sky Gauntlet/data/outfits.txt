	description "The smallest flywheel arrays used by Avernal shipbuilders aren't that much more advanced than similar systems found in human space - this is largely a result of simply not having enough room to implement the more advanced, but bulky technologies used in larger models. They require a standing charge to maintain their spin, and so bleed a small amount of power compared to other forms of battery."

	description "Avernal philosophy regards all things as constantly in motion, even if they appear otherwise. Advanced materials allow for the wheels of this array to reach angular velocities so high that they appear to be frozen in place; a sophisticated power control system allows for energy to be efficiently dumped off to power ship's systems, or poured in from the generators."

	description "At this scale Avernal flywheel tech begins to borrow design elements from their generators. Momentum control beam-tethers first pioneered to - over the course of millenia - transfer spin to dying stars are, in this flywheel, responsible for energy transmission. These wheels are so heavy and rotate with such speed that were they to break free of their mountins they would certainly destroy the ship that houses them. Happily, this is a defect that only manifests in 4% of manufactured flywheel arrays."

	description "Initially a tool used by science vessels to induce spin in stellar objects, it was discovered that the Angular Momentum Projector could simply be run in reverse. Connect the output to a turbine, and you've got a ready-made generator. Thus, the Angular Siphon was born. It has since become the mainstay of Avernal energy generation, powering almost anything larger than a fightercraft."

	description "Compared to the nuclear fission-or-fusion based reactors of other species, Avernal generators are remarkably light, cool-running, and low-maintenance. They are, however, reliant on the presence of nearby celestial bodies to draw power from - in absolute void they have no way of providing power. Although capable of drawing energy from any sufficiently massive rotating object, the generator works significantly better when close to a star."

	description "The mightiest space-stations in the Avernus Nebula draw their energy from tractor beams which gradually convert the angular momentum of black holes into power-generating torque. This technology, applied on a smaller scale, is also what powers their largest vessels. The generator works by tethering invisible tractor beams to a nearby celestial body, robbing it of its rotation in order to power the ship."
