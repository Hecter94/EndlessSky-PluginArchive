		has "event: war begins"
		not "main plot completed"
	attributes			# Required system attributes to choose this playlist.
		"near earth" "dirt belt" "south" "rim"
	silence 600 10 .2			# Number of seconds to wait between tracks, supporting the negative
						# binomial distribution syntax used for cargo/passengers to allow for randomness.
	priority 2			# The "tier" which playlists are picked from, where the highest value priority will always be used.
	weight 30				# Within a given priority "tier", higher weight playlists are more liekly (but not guaranteed) to be chosen.
	override				# If this attribute is present, and this playlist is available to play, immediately override what's currently playing.
	tracks "shuffle"/"linear"/"pick"	# List of tracks to pick from, and progression style.
						# Shuffle randomly sorts the playlists and plays through once.
						# Linear will play as written by the author.
						# Pick will randomly choose a single item, then stop the playlist.
		"FW War Track 1" 50
		"FW War Track 2" 50	# Individual tracks can be assigned specific weights.

# a core melody that can be swapped on the fly depending on the game state.
