			`"Very good." the Kimek replies and pulls a golden Heliarch circlet out of his pocket. He puts it on your head and connects it to a small electronic box with a cable. After about 20 seconds the whole procedure is over and the Heliarch license is activated. "And now please transfer the credits." He holds out a pad with bank details, which you confirm. After everything has been arranged, the Kimek leaves your ship. You should head to <destination> to take a look at the new equipment.`
