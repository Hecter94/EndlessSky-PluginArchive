### coalition.shopping
<br>
<br>
Adds all Coalition/Heliarch/Lunarium outfits and ships to 'Far Home' in 'Homeward' system.<br>
<br>
Adds all existing coalition outfitters and shipyards to 'Far Home'. Also adds a new shipyard and a new outfitter with missing ships/outfits.<br>
To start the mission to enable these outfitters and shipyards, you have to join Heliarch or Lunarium (complete the first chapter of these storylines) and own/pay 6/5 million credits. The mission starts anywhere in coalition space. I added this plausible mission to make the plugin feel less cheaty.<br>
