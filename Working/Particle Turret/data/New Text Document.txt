There is a pirate vessel known as the Vicious Viper in the Mizar system stirring up trouble. We believe this will be a fitting test. We will follow you in our ship, the Spacewind Scavenger. Be sure to return to Follower with us safely in one piece."

			`You are met in the spaceport by a junior engineer from Kraz Cybernetics, who leads you to their facility and introduces you to his boss, who is known as "Barmy Edward." Edward is wearing a set of thick welding glasses and smoking a cigarette. "Pleased to meet you," he says, extending a hand that is encased in a heavy leather glove.`

			`	"Don't call me 'sir,'" he says. "I'm not wearing a suit."`
			`	"Sorry," you say. "It's just all these militia habits I'm learning."`
				goto explain
			
			label same
			`	"I've heard good things about your work," he says. "Assisting the Free Worlds and all. Not that I'm big on politics, but I do like blowing things up."`
			choice
				`	"Me too."`
				`	"Well, we try to only blow things up when strictly necessary."`
			
			label explain
			`	"Of course," he says. "Anyway, I bet you're wondering what new toys we're going to let you play with." You nod. He says, "We've been trying to come up with a weapon for our capital ships, something that's a match for one of the Navy's heavy laser turrets. Something more elegant than those awful quad blaster turrets the Syndicate makes. So I thought, why not take the biggest thing we've got, and then mount a pair of them on a turret?" He beckons for you to follow, and leads you through a door and into a hangar.`
			scene "outfit/plasma turret"
			`	In front of you is a turret. It is almost absurdly large: a pair of plasma cannons mounted on a massive rotating base. "Sixty tons," says Barmy Edward. "Draws more power than... well, than anything else, practically. Runs a little hot, too."`
			choice
				`	"It's so... big!"`
					goto big
				`	"I want one!"`
					goto want
				`	"That's the ugliest turret I've ever seen."`
					goto ugly
			
			label big
			`	"Kind of mesmerizing, huh?" he says.`
				goto plan
			
			label want
			`	"Well, you'll have to wait a month or two for us to work out the kinks," he says.`
				goto plan
			
			label ugly
			`	"If you're looking for pretty," he says, "go buy one of those wussy guns that Lovelace Labs churn out. We don't do pretty here."`
				goto plan
			
			label plan
			`	"So, where do I come in?" you ask.`
			`	"Well, the Council says no testing against the Navy yet. No point in provoking a fight just to try out an untested weapon. So I asked them what other target they could suggest, and they mentioned this pirate ship by the name of Red Nile, that's been haunting the Ildaria system, sniping on merchants that take a wrong turn and end up there."`
			`	With a grand gesture, he indicates an aging Tarazed Falcon parked in the far corner of the hangar. It's a little rusty, and the paint is flaking, but a Falcon is an impressive ship under any circumstances. "We packed four of our prototypes into our department's very own test ship, the Walloping Window-Blind. We can't let you fly her, of course," he says, "on account of she's dearer to us than our own children. So the plan is, the Window-Blind will accompany you to Ildaria, and you fight the pirates together, taking careful note of how the guns perform. Sound like fun?`
			choice
				`	"You bet!"`
					accept
				`	"What sort of ship is the Red Nile?"`
			
			`	"One of those antiques from Betelgeuse," he says. "Shouldn't give you any bother. Meet us back here when you're done."`

			`When you enter the hangar, the Window-Blind has just returned, and a team of engineers are looking it over. Barmy Edward puts down his work to come over and debrief you. "How did the turrets perform?" he asks.`
			choice
				`	"Very impressive. I want a few of those on my own ship."`
					goto impressive
				`	"Well, I was a bit worried about the ship overheating, but otherwise they work well."`
					goto overheat

			`	"Yes," he said, "the team sent me some videos of the battle. First-rate carnage. I was very pleased. Anything weak spots you noticed?"`

				`	"It seems like the only way to fit a gun this big into most ships is by leaving half the hardpoints empty. It's a bit impractical."`
					goto hardpoints
				`	"It worked well against a large ship, but I wonder how well the turrets could track fighters."`
					goto fighters

			`	"It's true," he says, "most ships are designed expecting to be equipped with a larger number of smaller guns. But we think this might open up some interesting new directions in ship design."`

			`	"I guess we'll need to test it to find out," he says, "but our main goal was to have a weapon that could do serious damage to a cruiser. Right now the Navy's heaviest ships have ours severely outgunned."`

			label next
			`	"Do you know what my next assignment is?" you ask.`
			`	"Yes," he says, "leading a supply convoy to the front. You can meet up with them in the spaceport. Oh, and this is to thank you for your help." He hands you <payment>. "To help you pay for your first plasma turret once we've got them on the market," he says.`
			`	"When do you think that will be?" you ask.`
			`	"A month or two. I'll send you a message when they're available."`
			`	"Sounds good," you say. "Thanks for involving me in your tests!"`
