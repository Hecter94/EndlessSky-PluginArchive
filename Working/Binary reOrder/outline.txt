OUTFITS AND SHIPS

	The Binary Order															# very much an excuse to use the sprites, i can't write stuff
	nearby cluster machine-AI faction (Became fascinated with medieval Humans deposited by the Pug, who died off after a while.)
	friendly by default
	heroic/brave behavior
	ships {Designs that evoke Age of Sail ships but still make sense as starships. Full Swizzle support, with dark, plank-like hulls.}	# no swizzle support, wrong colour for that

	Light Freighter
		Sloop - small cargo, two gunports /												# yes
		Schooner - moderate cargo, three gunports, one turret /										# yes
	Interceptor
		Yacht - One turret, minimum cargo space /											# yes, scouting
		Felucca - one turret and gunport, small cargo /											# yes, combat
	Light Warship
		Monitor - two gunports, three turrets, small cargo, decent hull /								# yes, reduced to 1 turret, sprite is too small for 3, needs a slightly larger sprite
		Clipper - three turrets, one gunport, small cargo, decent hull /								# yes, renamed to caravel, clipper is a vanilla ship, spinal mount for divine light, no extra weapon space with that equipped, needs a slightly larger sprite
	Medium Warship
		Fl√ºte - five turrets, one gunport, moderate cargo, decent hull									# yes, fluyt, increased sprite size slightly, looks more like the other MWs but still smallest of the 3, spinal mount
		Trireme - six turrets, no gunports, moderate cargo, excellent hull, runs hot /							# yes, borderline heavy warship
		Ironclad - four turrets, four gunports, moderate cargo, fragile for size /							# yes, 30% hull instead of 15%

	weapons [Characterized by long, long range, slow, damaging pulse lasers, powerful but slow missiles, and actual cannon weaponry.]	# let's add some ion too, no missiles yet
		Quarterstaff Continuous Laser (Turret & Gun) {Yellow Laser}									# no, vanilla already has enough of these and plugins love them
		'Divine Light' Siege Laser (Spinal Mount) {Rainbow animated laser}								# yes, LW spinal, long range, good against shields, fuel drain, ion, no hull damage, siege implies starving of resources
		Rapier Light Pulse Laser (Turret & Gun) {Blue Laser}										# yes, very light, slower than moonbeam with shield focus instead of hull
		Shortsword Medium Pulse Laser (Turret & Gun) {Green Laser}									# no, too many tiers
		Broadsword Heavy Pulse Laser (Turret & Gun) {Purple Laser}									# yes, pretty heavy, slower than rapier, long range, disruption, considerably worse damage/mass than sunbeam, considerably worse disruption than korath disruptor
		Buckler Light Antimissile {Magenta Continuous Laser}										# yes, half continuous 30, lower range, green
		Kite Shield Medium Antimissile {Cyan Continuous Laser}										# yes, half continuous 30, low range, green
		Tower Shield Heavy Antimissile {}												# no, 2 tiers is enough, most species have 1
		Archer Missile Launcher (Thunderhead without the splitting)									# no, we have cannons and lasers
		Petard Torpedo Launcher (Ion + heat + disruption)										# no, we have cannons and lasers
		Trebuchet Cannon (Spinal Mount) [Piercing]											# yes, 30% piercing, high hit force, MW spinal, high hull damage, no shield damage, looks somewhat unimpressive
		Janissary Cannon (Gun & Turret) [Piercing]											# yes, 20% piercing, weaker trebuchet, named ballista, turret only, high hull damage, no shield damage
		'Dragon's Breath' Flamethrower (Spinal Mount) [Heat, Ion, & Energy Damage. heavy fuel usage]					# no, making this somewhat balanced but also not eclipsed by the vanilla flamethrower is impossible
																		# new cannon named arbalest, grapeshot, 10% piercing, smaller than ballista, gun port only, high hull damage, no shield damage

	outfits [Weaker shields than Human equals; stronger hulls than Korath, heavy repair focus. Shield Generator provide no capacity.	# i think the wooden hulls should rather be fragile 15% and supported by strong shields 85%
	ships have none to start with. batteries drain shield passively, a tiny bit. powerful fuel generation, big fuel storage.]		# no, antisynergy with large shields
		Traveler Drive (Worse than HD) "Fold Space to them, Hypderdrive to others"							# yes, less fuel efficient, lighter
		Knight Drive (Slightly Better Scram Drive & short range jumpdrive) ^								# yes, slightly less fuel efficient, lighter, no new jump drives
		Squire Ammunition Bay (All ammo types, heavy)											# maybe, could introduce cannonballs and grapeshot as ammunition
		Ice Spirit Cooler (Liquid CO2. 25% more efficient than LH cooler)								# yes, less efficient than heat shunts, bigger than human counterpart
		Water Spirit Cooler (Water Cooler Plus. 15% more efficient)									# yes, less efficient than heat shunts, bigger than human counterpart
		Palisade Shield Generator													# yes, low regen, high disruption and pierce protection
		Rampart Shield Generator													# yes, low regen, high disruption and pierce protection
		Fortress Shield Generator													# yes, low regen, high disruption and pierce protection
		Carpenter Hull Repair System													# no need for hull repair with no hulls
		Mason Hull Repair System													# no need for hull repair with no hulls
		Divine Protection Module (Ion Protection & Resist)										# no, disruption and pierce protection, included in shield generators, not standalone
		Brigantine Armor														# no, see lake and pond
		Half Plate Armor														# no, see lake and pond
		Full Plate Armor														# no, see lake and pond
		Dragon Scale Armor (Hull protection, major hull increase.)									# no, see lake and pond
		Bucket Shield Battery														# no, antisynergy
		Pond Shield Battery														# yes, trades gun port for low hull
		Lake Shield Battery														# yes, trades turret mount for moderate hull
		Ocean Shield Battery														# no, antisynergy
		Garden Fuel Processor														# yes, consumes energy to make fuel, enough to counter chicken thrusting, not turning, flamethrower balance is already a joke
		Farm Fuel Processor														# yes, consumes energy to make fuel, enough to counter donkey thrusting, not turning, flamethrower balance is already a joke
		Pantry Fuel Tank														# yes, small fuel storage
		Silo Fuel Tank															# yes, large fuel storage
		Warehouse Fuel Tank														# no, too many tiers
		Divinity Core (AI Core. Unplunderable.)												# yes, can only be installed in ships of this faction, takes 10 space to give the player a choice between space and free escorts, automata capture mechanic

	power (*-Micro Cold Fusion **-Hot-Fusion Liquid Salt Cooled Reactor 
	***-Antimatter Reactor[blazing hot, but nearly as strong as Quarg]. Flywheel batteries.)						# quarg tier is off limits, higher tiers are overkill with no HW
		Quail Reactor*															# yes, based on hai, -7% space, +10% power, +20% heat

	engines (Chemical engines; hot and fuel hungry but take no energy (and maybe produce it as a thrust byproduct)				# yes, uses fuel, low thrust and upkeep, no energy production
		Chicken Combined Propulsion (Fuel, No Energy)											# yes, but not combined
		Goat Steering & Thrusters (Fuel, no energy)											# yes
		Donkey Steering & Thrusters (fuel, no energy)											# yes
		Horse Steering & Thrusters (fuel, no energy)											# yes

		Dragon Wings Afterburner (Heat + Energy, No Fuel)										# no, don't want to introduce fuel-free afterburners
																		# 1 fuel = 50 thrust
																		# 1 energy = 4.7 thrust
																		# 1 fuel = ca 10 energy
																		# stolen from Fero, based on an afterburner

OTHER IDEAS

	4 license tiers																# no, not a priority
	Very 40k Mechanicus about tech, despite being AI themselves.										# maybe, not familiar enough with 40k to know what this means
	(Ships are all Automated, but not by default, to allow buying and using them. Super modular internally)					# yes, automata capture mechanic
	<No Bunks, lots of cargo space, cargo-bunk conversion kits>										# yes, 25 cargo = 3 bunks should be sufficiently weak, but does buff all capping ships significantly

	Heavy Freighter
		Barque - huge cargo, four turrets, two gunports											# no sprite
		Merchantman - absurd cargo space, runs hot, 6 turrets, three gunports								# no sprite

	Heavy Warship
		Galleon - eight turrets, two gunports, large cargo, very good hull, 4 fighter and 2 drone hangars				# no sprite
		Man-of-War - twelve turrets turrets, no gunports, massive cargo, great hull, 6 drone and fighter slots				# no sprite
		Battlecruiser - twelve turrets, six gunports, massive cargo, absurd hull, no hangars						# no sprite

	Fighter
		Pram - two gunports, tiny cargo, weaker than sloop										# no sprite
		Catamaran - two gunports, two turrets, weaker than schooner, tiny cargo								# no sprite

	Drone
		Outrigger - one gunport, no cargo space, fragile, fast										# no sprite

	Void Lifeforms																# fun idea
	Same cluster as the Order
	Some peaceful, some *Hostile to all, divided into different groups.
	Void Dragons*, Sprites (expanded from vanilla sprites), Subsidurials, Anemones*, Sharks*, Wyrms*

	Void Dragons are something akin to Stellaris' Void Dragon leviathan.
	Anemones would be visually similar to an Anemone, hence the name, but capable of *very* minimal movement, and jump-driving.
	Sharks are probably mostly literal sharks, just big
	Wyrms are...worm-like. Think Grabboids, from Tremors, but starship scale, and longer.

	All new beasts feast on metals (You, AI ships, etc.) and Asteroids									# should wooden ships make them passive?
	Ion immune, usually no shields, tons of hull and regen.
	Jump Drive capable, about equal to Order ships in firepower?
