	description "A medium range gun designed to punch through heavy armor. The raw damage output also enables it to overwhelm weaker shield emitters."
	description "A truly devastating weapon platform, named for the archaic god of volcanoes. A typical turret mount features two 120mm L/89 barrels that take turns firing armor destroying rounds at 240 rounds a minute. An electro-magnetic ejector, powered feed system and nanocoolants allow the weapon to fire for extended time periods. The shaped charge shells have low muzzle velocity and great armor penetrating power."

	description "A specialized weapon designed to overload and disable enemy systems from afar. The high-velocity duranium slug is also effective against shields."
	description "The hypervelocity driver uses a 2-stage process to accelerate a 55mm duranium slug with a magnetized iron-cobalt core to a very high velocity. A chemical charge accelerates the slug first, and then the magnetic coils take over, accelerating the slug further and stabilizing its trajectory. The slug is highly charged by the time it reaches the target, generating a significant amount of electromagnetic interference on the ship it impacts."

	description "A guided missile well-suited for long-range support by non-combat ships. Most useful in large numbers that can help overwhelm enemy ships."
	description "A technologically mature weapon system, the Pilum-class missile is the obvious choice for long-range strikes by cautious captains. The guidance system on this weapon make it dangerous versus only the heavier of enemy craft. Unfortunately, those craft also tend to have the best point defense system, which somewhat limits the Pilum's otherwise considerable punch."

	description "Medium range energy weapon, effective at neutralizing missile and fighter threats. Can be fired for extended periods, but the damage is subpar."
	description "An additional lens assembly eliminates self-diffusing particles from a standard carbon dioxide beam fired at a wavelength of eleven microns. The extended range permits the otherwise low wattage to have a greater impact on the targets. Particularly useful in destroying missiles headed for a shielded target - a standard point defense laser generally doesn't have the range to extend far enough past the defensive shields of the ship it is supposed to protect."

	description "	A defensive weapon system that fires shrapnel-filled shells equipped with a proximity fuse for maximum effect against fighters and missiles."
	description "The rising prominence of small, cheap fighter craft, especially in the strike role has led to a wider deployment of this weapons system. A 40 mm barrel fires rounds fitted with a proximity fuse. The resulting explosion sends a hail of flechettes in a wide area, with a kill radius of 45 meters. Newer models feature a fire control system hardwired into a Mark VI Predictor."

	description "Features a built-in capacitor that lets the weapon fire several bursts in quick succession if allowed to fully recharge. Excellent vs missiles and fighters."
	description "The burst point defense laser is a further refinement of standard PD beam weapons. The q-switched gain medium is pulse pumped, ensuring that the power delivered to the titanium-doped sapphire gain medium peaks at a predefined interval. The result is a weapon that fires once every couple of seconds and is extremely effective for its small size. Power consumption is small enough that even some fighter craft power cores can handle the firing load."
