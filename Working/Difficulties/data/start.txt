	`	Finaly, it was time. The adventurer had just earned their pilots licence and are ready to set out for what the galixy has to offer. Given to them without payment, they have just obtained one of the best ships ever made along with a forture of credits to keep expences away. Now, one last thing before they go... who is this traveler's name?`
	name
	`	And without further ado, the traveler gets ready to go by checking out the job board and perhaps buying a few items from the market. Then, they shall be ready to start their adventure beyond Earth. Who knows what will happen from then...`

	description `	Unlike the original Endless Sky, this "normal" mode will start the player off with a Quicksilver skipping most of the starting grind. Even though it doesn't change that much, I still reccomend first-time players to play the game normaly so they can see the true feeling of Endless Sky.`

start "hard"
	name "Hard Mode"
	description `	Desperate times call for desperate measures. If you choose this mode, you're in for a lot more grinding. This is because in this mode, not only will you be stuck with a modified wasp, you will also have major loan issues meaning that getting a better ship will be very hard. If it isn't already obvious, first-timers are reccomended NOT to play this mode.`
