			label eyes
			`"You have a rather... peculiar eye colour." You tell the woman, to which she sighs before replying.`
			`"I should've known it'd be about that. I'm sure you've heard of the alphas by now. Well... before that humanity was already dabbling into genetic engineering. Mostly for cosmetic and medical reasons. Of which the former proved to be the easier thing to do. So people with enough money turned to genetic engineering to change their appearance. Eventually it became easier to do and things like changing eye and hair colour became quite cheap. So people just changed their hair or eye colour as a form of self expression, like tattoos I suppose. A little while later the Alphas were created, this caused genetic engineering to become regulated by the Republic and only used for medical purposes. And... well... One of my ancestors did it as self expression as you might've noticed."`
			choice
				`	(Ask her what she is doing here.)`
					goto here
				`	(That's all you wanted to know.)`
					goto goodbye
				`	(Ask her if there are side effects.)`
					goto side
				
			label side
			`"You're modifying your genetics." She begins. "Of course there are side effects."`
			`"The first two generations were especially notorious. The side effects of the first generation made people infertile. And the bones of the people who took gene mods during the second generation became far more fragile than they used to be. That caused for many people untimely deaths, so there aren't really any first and second generation gene modded people left. There are a few generations left after the first two, of which the side effects became less threatening. One of my ancestors took one of the last generation of gene mods, so my side effect is negligible. We're incapable of producing body hair and, if you're a male, facial hair." She pauses for a bit before speaking again. "That is honestly all I can really tell you about it. So I don't know if you have any other questions?"`

			`"I'm afraid I won't be able to help you with that. My ship isn't really made for either of those tasks." You tell her honestly.` 
			`"No worries captain." The woman begins. "I'm sure I'll find someone eventually. Have a wonderfull day." She says while leaving, not even waiting for a reply.`
				decline

			`"Oh? Do you now?" The woman asks, to which you merely nod. "Well captain, here's the thing."`
			`"My parents are being hunted by pirates, because my dad has this mod as well. I got it from someone afterall. They're hunting them because talent agencies pay a large sum of credits just to get in contact with someone who has a... let's just say unnatural trait. So my idea was to land on Shaula and get them off the planet as fast as we can. What do you say captain, are you willing to help me?" She asks nervously.`
			choice
				`	(yes.)`
					goto yes
				`	(no.)`
					goto no
					
			label no
			`"I'm sorry. But this sounds too risky to me." You tell the woman who nods saddenly, but understanding.`
			`"Don't worry captain. That probably the smarter decision. Well then, have a goodday."  She says walking off somewhere.`

			`"That would be me, yes." The woman that is most likely Samantha's mother looks relieved. "Well... let's go to your ship then. I'm sure Samantha and Richard will be waiting somewhere around the landing erea.`
			`The walk back towards your ship goes over in silence, and without commotion. However there are no signs of Samantha or this Richard person the woman talked about earlier. You are considering asking the woman about this as your train of thought is interrupted by some shouting coming from the space port entrance.`
			`Two figures come running out of the space port, followed by a group of what you can only assume to be pirates. Both individuals are clad in the same cloak that Samantha's mother is wearing and, upon closer inspection, they both have yellow eyes.`
			`The last one of the two to board your ship hastily closes the boarding ramp, while an out of breath Samantha shouts. "We need to leave!"`
