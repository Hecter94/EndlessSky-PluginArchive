### no.more.mereti.mines
<br>
<br>
Removes the mines from Mereti ships and replaces them with Mereti-typical guns to increase game performance.<br>
<br>
Replaces Cluster Mine Layer, Cluster Mine Racks and Cluster Mines with Husk-Slice and Shield Disruptor guns, and if need be Heat Shunts, on Model 16/32/64/128/256/512. For every removed mine layer guns and heat shunts got added. That increases game performance in mass fights, like in Mesuket system.<br>
Added bunrodean swarm pods change by timeout.fu. Now it fires less, but with more damage.br>
