This plugin operates under the assumption that news of freaking alien squirrels with advanced technology in close proximity to humanity would plausibly spread rapidly and that some humans will want to be using their ships. It therefore adds Hai ships with plenty of human/hai tech mixed variants as very rare additions to human ambient fleets in the late game. This makes merchant fleets more interesting and pirate combat more spicy!
