Every attribute matches the Inhibitor Cannon other than the firing synchronizer. Our Inhibitor Cannons are designed so a ship can fire a volley and flee while the target is inhibited. With the synchronizer gone, a battery of Modified Inhibitors fires in a steady stream. This setup is ideal for immobilizing and entrapping, a strategy fit for someone who has no intention of fleeing the target: a pirate. This was made by someone with a precise understanding of not only how the Remnant Inhibitor Cannon works, but how the Remnant use it and why that is not ideal for how a pirate would use it."`

			`	Taely signs her response, "Your 'Beelzebub' is probably Prefect Perfid, the Deserter."`
			`	Chilia begins to sing a sad song. It tells the tale of a Remant Prefect who lead a surveillance mission in human space. When confronted by pirates, the Prefect decided to fight rather than flee. After capturing the pirate ship, he chose to remain behind instead of returning to Remnant space.`
			`	Torza punches a wall then signs, "He should never have been allowed to remain there."`
			`	Chilia responds, signing "Our people are not prisoners. It is rare, but occasionally one of us does end up living amongst the ancestral humans." Chilia turns to you. "Captain <last>. Prefect Perfid, Beelzebub, has abandoned life as a Remnant to live as a Pirate. We leave his fate in your capable hands." That almost sounds like an assassination order.`
			`	While Chilia was singing earlier, Taely was preparing the Modified Inhibitor for transportation to your ship. She signs, "I have instructed our outfitters to supply you with more of these if you request them. Perhaps they will be useful when you confront Beelzebub."`
