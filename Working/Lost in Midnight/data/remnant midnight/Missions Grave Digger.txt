Pilots are being asked to wait with their ships until the checks are complete. As you look about the port you spot Charles Atinoda supervising a squad of guards. On second thought, it looks more like the guards are questioning him. He looks tense and frustrated.`

The hangar security systems were damaged and the entire squad of guards who had been assigned to protect the ship were killed by the thieves. Whoever did this must be highly skilled professionals."`
			choice
				`	"Why were the guards questioning you?"`
			`Charles sighs. "I was suspected because I had developed a habit of taking the prototype out on test flights... during my weekends off. And, well..." he looks down dejectedly. "There was some concern that I might not have properly reactivated the security systems when returning the ship to its hangar."`
			`You can see that Charles is genuinely saddened by the theft.`
			`"That protoype was my dream ship, <first>. The thief didn't just steal a ship. He stole my dream."`
