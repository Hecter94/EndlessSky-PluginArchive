	description `This modified version of the Inhibitor Cannon lacks the firing synchronization of the standard Remnant version. The result is that instead of firing a volley of inhibitor projectiles, a group of these weapons will produce a steady stream. Intimate knowledge of how the weapon works is necessary to make this sort of modification while leaving the weapon's other attributes unchanged.`

But the system data does indicate that its primary purpose involves providing the ship with a crude form of stealth via radar and optical jamming. If removed through conventional means, the organ would probably die.`

	description "A weapon stolen from Farpoint's evidence vault, this utilizes design concepts similar to those found in the Remant Tuning Rifle. While not as refined in its ability to pinpoint organs to liquefy, it's true potential is in the echo that grows in intensity as the soundwaves reverberates down spaceship corridors, eventually becoming strong enough to knock humans off their feet. As the sounds bounce off walls, they can even hit targets hiding behind corners. Unfortunately, this weapon is useless outside of the confines of a spaceship."
