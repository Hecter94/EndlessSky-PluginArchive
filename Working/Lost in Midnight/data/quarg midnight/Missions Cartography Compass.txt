Another pilot offers to buy you a drink and asks about your experiences flying outside of human space. You begin with the tale of how you found Hai space. This gets a few giggles from the crowd. The night wears on as more stories are told and more drinks are poured. Eventually, you mention the abandoned Hai systems to the far west near Terminus.`

Eventually, the conversation moves on to other topics. You keep swapping stories for hours, until the cafe is ready to close.`
