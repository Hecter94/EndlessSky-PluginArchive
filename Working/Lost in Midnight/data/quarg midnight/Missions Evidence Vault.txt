As the story goes, a few months ago the Covert mining cartel got ahold of an alien device that could quickly convert large amounts of coal into diamonds. The cartel employee responsible for safeguarding the device stabbed the cartel in the back and has become a pirate warlord. It turns out the device can be used as a powerful weapon, and the Underdark was its latest victim. The cartel has placed a hefty bounty on his ship, the Diabolos. While it has already made several attacks on cartel ships in Gienah, they must be using another pirate outpost as their base of operations.`
