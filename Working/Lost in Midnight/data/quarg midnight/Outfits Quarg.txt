	description "A parasitic incorporeal entity from another dimension. Midnight's Lost Orphan grants its host strange unnatural powers that can bend or warp time and space."
	description "	However, the entity feeds on negative emotions and will manipulate the mental state of anyone nearby towards taking actions that cause strife, pain, and suffering among friend and foe alike. Crew productivity and teamwork takes a severe downturn whenever the entity is allowed to exert itself. A simple task that would normally take one crew member to perform can require two or three as tense arguments and disagreements hamper efficiency."

	description "A weapon that once belonged to a rogue Quarg, the Graviton Generator causes a small singularity to appear temporarily at the distance and direction set by the wielder. Anything caught within the implosion point is instantly crushed from the extreme gravitational forces generated. Unlike traditional firearms no projectile is actually launched from the weapon, rendering line of sight seemingly meaningless."
	description "	Due to the potential collateral damage this weapon can cause, using it to defend your own ship from boarders is ill advised."

	description "While the rogue Quarg who previously owned this could have wielded it in one hand, humans and other smaller species need both arms to use this Quantum Phase Pistol. Once locked onto the chosen target, it creates and fires a projectile which phases through any matter that would impede its trajectory. The technology that enables this weapon to work is beyond your understanding."
