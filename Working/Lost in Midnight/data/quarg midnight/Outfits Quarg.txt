	description "The workings of the jump drive are a total mystery. The best that human scientists have been able to find out is that this device is a containment field for matter in a state that cannot normally exist in this universe; if the drive is opened up, the field collapses and its contents disappear. Therefore, even though a few jump drives have been captured over the years, it has so far proved impossible to reverse engineer them."

Crew productivity and teamwork takes a severe downturn whenever the entity is allowed to exert itself. A simple task that would normally take one crew member to perform can require two or three as tense arguments and disagreements hamper efficiency."

Anything caught within the implosion point is instantly crushed from the extreme gravitational forces generated. Unlike traditional firearms, no projectile is actually launched from the weapon, rendering line of sight seemingly meaningless."

Once locked onto the chosen target, it creates and fires a projectile which phases through any matter that would impede its trajectory.
