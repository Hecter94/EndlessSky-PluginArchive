	description "However, the entity feeds on negative emotions and will manipulate the mental state of anyone nearby towards taking actions that cause strife, pain, and suffering among friend and foe alike. Crew productivity and teamwork takes a severe downturn whenever the entity is allowed to exert itself. A simple task that would normally take one crew member to perform can require two or three as tense arguments and disagreements hamper efficiency."
