			`	You stretch out your arms, preparing to wield the terrifying power of Midnight's Lost Orphan... But it's not there! The power, the presence, of the entity is gone! The Quarg are speaking to you, but it's hard to focus on their words as the realization that the Orphan abandoned you settles in.`

Oddly, you don't recall what room that door leads to. Several Quarg glare as you step closer to look in. Beyond the doorway is some sort of device cobbled together from stolen Quarg technology. You don't remember for certain what it does, but your gut reaction is that this is some kind of weapon designed to cause mass destruction on a galactic scale...`

Curiously, you can't seem to recall what room that door leads to and step closer to look in. There, an unfortunate Quarg lies on an operating table with it's body splayed open. The organs of the still living Quarg glisten under a bright surgical lamp as they shudder, exposed for all to see. Equally disturbing are the body parts of other alien species unnaturally grafted onto its body...`

Strangely, you don't remember having such a compartment on the <ship>. Your thoughts are interrupted by an unsettling alien sound coming from the hole. You and the other Quarg who didn't fall in peer into the gap to see the first Quarg who addressed you earlier is waste deep in the blood spattered corpses of several sentient species, both human and alien. The disturbing sound reverberating through the chamber is the Quarg's anguished wailing...`

			`	They don't allow you to get as much as a word out before one of the guards has locked your arms behind your back, completely halting your attempts to fight back with surprisingly little effort. You are brought before something akin to a Quarg jury, where you are found guilty of intergalactic atrocities you don't remember committing. At the end of it all, they sentence you to life imprisonment.`
			`	You spend the rest of your days in the same cell, which although large and comfortable, quickly proves plain and dull. You're kept in very good health and are well fed, but the Quarg do not allow you to leave the cell and seldom entertain your attempts at striking conversation. You get few visitors and can only wonder what life would've been like had you the chance to live out all these years in freedom, the captain of a starship.`
