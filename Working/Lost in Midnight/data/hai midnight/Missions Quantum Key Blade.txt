If so, their potency may have diminished over the millenia." Turning to you he says, "But even so, they may yet still be more powerful than the Nuclear missiles I have heard humans describe."`

The Unfettered must have discovered some clue specifying its location amongst their plunder from the Wanderers. Go captain, and stop him before he tears apart your people in his search."`
