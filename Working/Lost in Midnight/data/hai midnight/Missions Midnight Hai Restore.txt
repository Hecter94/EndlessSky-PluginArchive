I just don't know what to do anymore, I've been working for so long to qualify for this loan, but I'm running out of time and I'll never be able to pay it like this."`
			`	Turns out the documents she is holding are the bank papers for the loan, somewhat similar to the one you took when you bought your first ship. You've come a long way since your days as a beginner, and know how hard it is to be starting out as a starship captain; you could probably convince someone here to offer a simple cargo job to this young Hai.`
			choice

					goto "positive1"

			`	You introduce yourself to Nanachi and shake her paw. "Can you show me your ship so I can look for jobs it's best suited for?" you ask.`
			`	She hesitates a bit, but leads you to her ship. You were expecting a small Hai ship, but to your surprise she shows you a rather beat-up Heavy Shuttle docked near your own ship.`
			`	"You took a loan to buy a human ship?" you ask.`
			`	She looks at the ground, as if ashamed of it. "It'd take way too long for me to qualify for a loan for even an Aphid, but I recently met a human merchant who wanted to sell his old ship; it was difficult, but I managed to convince him to sell it to me instead of going to the shipyard office. I paid him its full price, but even for this one I had to take out the biggest loan I could. Its cargo hold isn't very impressive but it has more bunks than our smallest ships, if that helps."`
			choice
				`	"Let's see if anyone in the spaceport needs a lift off the planet."`
				`	"Let's take another look at the job board, maybe a smaller job will pop up."`
			`	Turns out this isn't as easy as you thought it'd be. The spaceport is almost empty, save for the occasional worker or drunken crewmember, and the job board is filled with massive hauls of minerals, aside from a few small but dangerous jobs to human space. Eventually, as you two begin scouting the edge of the docking area, you spot a troubled human merchant near several crates. You approach him and he explains that his ship had some malfunctions and he cannot deliver his cargo of advanced surgical equipment to <destination>. "This is the worst! One jump away from the planet and the navigation system suddenly decides to go on strike! There's no way I can make it before the deadline!"`
			`	"My friend Nanachi here could deliver it for you. We were heading there anyway; a few extra crates won't make a difference," you say, trying to sound as convincing as possible.`
			`	At first, he seems delighted that you two want to help him, but when Nanachi mentions that she's flying a Heavy Shuttle, he frowns, and looks back at the cargo. "Unfettered attacks make it so they need tons of medical supplies on <planet>, and quite frankly I'm not comfortable letting such a fragile ship go into dangerous territory carrying this equipment when it could be blasted to bits in an instant," he says. The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`

			`	"Oh um, I don't think I'll get used to the feeling anytime soon. I threw up a lot so I'm glad this wasn't a job with passengers. I've always dreamt of being on other worlds, exploring and learning everything about them. I'm glad I'm finally able to do it."`
			`	You help her get the crates out of the cargo hold and contact the client. Nanachi's share of the payment is small, as the client transfers most of the money to the merchant she got the job from, but that doesn't make her any less excited about getting her first paycheck.`

Now that many merchants are here, they're trapped. They expended most of if not all of their ammunition trying to get here, and now they have none to defend them on their way back.
