	description `During the ancient Hai empire, Millipedes operated as troop transports. When the empire fell into decline, Millipedes transported refugees from the ruined Hai worlds to the Hai civilizations current location. Once the Hai settled down, there was no longer a need for such a massive transport ship. Few Millipedes remain today. The ones still in operation are mostly used as Unfettered boarding vessels.`
