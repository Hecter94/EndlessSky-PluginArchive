However, after seeing the Giftbringer in action, the Unfettered settled on a rival prototype that would eventually become the Solifuge."

	description "Excelling at both transportation and logistics, the Titan Beetle is more versatile than the Shield Beetle in every aspect but combat. A key component of this are the built-in collection gills which magnify the natural ramscoop present in all ships and large capacity fuel tanks that facilitated uninterrupted travel to far-flung regions of the Hai empire."
