After a few hours, you arrive at a place where several other groups have set up tents and campfires. By the time the sun sets Blawi's camping club has their own campfire going.`
			`	"Let's roast chestnuts!" One of the club members, Hemijo if you remember her name correctly, is holding up a big bag of what are supposedly chestnuts. After she tears it open, Dolewi, a husky Hai who had some trouble during the earlier hike, starts impaling the nuts on barbecue sticks. From their large size and ease with which he pierced them, it's obvious that these aren't the chestnuts from Earth that are sold and distributed throughout human space. Hemijo notices your interest and explains, "Oh <first>! These aren't the chestnuts imported from human space. It's actually a tropical fruit native to Greenbloom's rainforests. We just call them chestnuts because that's what humans say they are reminded of when we roast them."`

Remembering how Dolewi reacted earlier, you blow on the "chestnut" a few times to let it cool before taking a bite. Blawi, Hemijo, and Dolewi are all staring as you swallow...`

You recognize Dolewi beating a drum while Hemijo has joined in the chant. The chanting stops as Blawi stands before you. He yells, "In the name of the true Hai we offer this SACRIFICE TO THE ACORN GOD," before stabbing you in the chest!
