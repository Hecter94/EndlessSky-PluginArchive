After a few hours, you arrive at a place where several other groups have set up tents and campfires. By the time the sun sets Blawi's camping club has their own campfire going.`
			`	"Let's roast chestnuts!" One of the club members, Hemijo if you remember her name correctly, is holding up a big bag of what are supposedly chestnuts. After she tears it open, Dolewi, a husky Hai who had some trouble during the earlier hike, starts impaling the nuts on barbecue sticks. From their large size and ease with which he pierced them, it's obvious that these aren't the chestnuts from Earth that are sold and distributed throughout human space. Hemijo notices your interest and explains, "Oh <first>! These aren't the chestnuts imported from human space. It's actually a tropical fruit native to Greenbloom's rainforests. We just call them chestnuts because that's what humans say they are reminded of when we roast them."`

He takes another bite, wiping the juice running down the sides of his mouth and licks his paws. There's still one stick of uncooked fruit, but Dolewi doesn't seem interested in roasting it.`

Hot steam wafts up from the roasted fruit when you pull it back from the flames. Its sweet aroma tantalizes your senses. Remembering how Dolewi reacted earlier, you blow on the "chestnut" a few times to let it cool before taking a bite. Blawi, Hemijo, and Dolewi are all staring as you swallow...`

You recognize Dolewi beating a drum while Hemijo has joined in the chant. The chanting stops as Blawi stands before you. He yells, "In the name of the true Hai we offer this SACRIFICE TO THE ACORN GOD," before stabbing you in the chest! The Hai cultists cheer as the other human sacrifices look with horror at your last dying moments, knowing they'll soon meet the same fate.`
