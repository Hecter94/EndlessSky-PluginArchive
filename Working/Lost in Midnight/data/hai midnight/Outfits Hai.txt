	description "Deployed at the start of the Unfettered invasion of Wanderer space, Ion Pulse Cannons disrupt the electrical systems on any ship they hit. Individually, they aren't as effective as Ion Cannons, but these weapons are meant to be used in multiples. As a group they synchronize their rate of fire, creating waves of ionizing projectiles."

	description "A pair of modified heavy pulse pistols favored by some Unfettered and the occasional pirate captain. Dual wielding them adds another gun during short raids against a ship's defenders. Individually, they lose their energy charge more quickly than a pulse rifle, making them a poor choice for holding a defensive position during a long siege."

	description "A weapon stolen from Farpoint's evidence vault, this appears to be a heavily modified Hai Pulse Rifle. Twin barrels fire a pair of ion pulse blasts that collide as they rush towards the target, bursting into a spread that affects a wide area. Mechanical weapons caught in the blast temporarily become inoperable. Ironically, due to the intensity of the recoil, smaller species such as the Hai may find this weapon difficult to wield."
