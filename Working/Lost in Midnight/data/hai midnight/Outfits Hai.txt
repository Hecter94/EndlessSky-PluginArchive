	description "The Hai once deployed Nutcracker missiles long ago against an enemy occupying a galactic region far from their space. The campaign didn't end well. After it was over, this weapon was abandoned over concerns about its collateral damage and potential lingering effects resulting from prolonged use."
	description "	This weapon is no longer in production. It is a relic from an age of Hai domination and galactic conquest."
	description "	[Nutcracker missiles are a one-shot weapon: each missile occupies a gun slot, and after it is fired, the slot it was in is left empty.]"

	description "An antique rarely seen on modern Hai ships, many consider Heavy Pulse Cannons obsolete. However this weapon would be a valid alternative as a substitute for an Ion Cannon. It may not be able to disrupt an enemy ship's energy systems, but the power of its shots should not be underestimated."

	description "Deployed at the start of the Unfettered invasion of Wanderer space, Ion Pulse Cannons disrupt the electrical systems on any ship they hit. Individually, they aren't as effective as Ion Cannons, but these weapons are meant to be used in multiples. As a group they synchronize their rate of fire, creating waves of ionizing projectiles."

	description "Featuring a single Ion Pulse Cannon mounted onto a rotating turret base, this weapon does less damage than the similarly sized Pulse Turret. Despite this, some Unfettered captains consider the option to deliver additional ion damage from a turret mount well worth the trade-off."
	description "	These turrets are designed to synchronize their rate of fire with each other as well as non-turreted Ion Pulse Cannons."

	description "Komodo Anti-Missiles are more powerful than other Hai anti-missile systems, but their large space requirements compromises the offensive capabilities of the Unfettered ships they are installed on."

	description "Favored by Unfettered captains who want to maximize damage from hit and run strikes, Pulse Repeaters can unleash a rapid burst of projectiles followed by a lengthy cool down period. This gives the pilot time to reposition before firing the next volley."
	description "	Inspired by alien weapons installed on the ships of a hostile species the Hai fought long ago, Pulse Repeaters aren't for sale at any Unfettered outfitter. However, any Unfettered engineer worth their acorns should be able to convert a regular Pulse Cannon into one. Whether or not they would be willing to do so is a separate issue."

	description "A pair of Pulse Repeaters mounted onto a turret allow for powerful hit and run attacks with a rapid burst of projectiles followed by a lengthy cool down period. Focusing fire with all of your turrets is essential to taking full advantage of this feature."
	description "	Unfettered outfitters are unwilling to stock this weapon due to the potential of an alien inspired modification being perceived as superior to the original Hai version. Despite this, more than a few Unfettered starship captains have commissioned these conversions to gain an edge on the battlefield."

	description "Any ship an Ionic Snare is installed on will have its power systems disrupted. The Hai developed this device during the Korath invasion to give their crews a way to sabotage enemy ships that got close enough to board."

	"capture attack" 2.0
	"capture defense" 1.4
	"unplunderable" 1
	description "A pair of modified heavy pulse pistols favored by some Unfettered and the occasional pirate captain. Dual wielding them adds another gun during short raids against a ship's defenders. Individually, they lose their energy charge more quickly than a pulse rifle, making them a poor choice for holding a defensive position during a long siege."

	description "A weapon stolen from Farpoint's evidence vault, this appears to be a heavily modified Hai Pulse Rifle. Twin barrels fire a pair of ion pulse blasts that collide as they rush towards the target, bursting into a spread that affects a wide area. Mechanical weapons caught in the blast temporarily become inoperable. Ironically, due to the intensity of the recoil, smaller species such as the Hai may find this weapon difficult to wield."
