	description "Favored by Unfettered captains who want to maximize damage from hit and run strikes, Pulse Repeaters can unleash a rapid burst of projectiles followed by a lengthy cool down period. This gives the pilot time to reposition before firing the next volley."
	description "	Inspired by alien weapons installed on the ships of a hostile species the Hai fought long ago, Pulse Repeaters aren't for sale at Unfettered outfitters. However, any Unfettered engineer worth their acorns should be able to convert a regular Pulse Cannon into one. Whether or not they would be willing to do so is a separate issue."

	description "	Unfettered outfitters are unwilling to stock this weapon due to the potential of an alien inspired modification being perceived as superior to the original Hai version. Despite this, more than a few Unfettered starship captains have commissioned these conversions to gain an edge on the battlefield."
