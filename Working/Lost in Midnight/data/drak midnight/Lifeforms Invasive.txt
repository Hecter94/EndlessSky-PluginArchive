	description "An invasive species from beyond our galaxy. They seem possessed by an insatiable curiosity, observing everything they encounter with multiple eyes and other, more alien, sensory organs. While not particularly aggressive, Stargazers can be dangerous if provoked. Their bodies are covered with sharp quills that can be flung towards predators. They regenerate quickly, allowing them to maintain a constant stream of fire. These projectiles are made of a material that evades detection by anti-missile systems and may have other unknown properties."
