While not particularly aggressive, Stargazers can be dangerous if provoked. Their bodies are covered with sharp quills that can be flung towards predators. They regenerate quickly, allowing them to maintain a constant stream of fire. These projectiles are made of a material that evades detection by anti-missile systems and may have other unknown properties."
