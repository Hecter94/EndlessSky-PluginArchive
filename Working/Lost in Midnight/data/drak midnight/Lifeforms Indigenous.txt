	description "Although it lacks the ability to travel through Hyperspace on its own, these parasitic predators evolved a means to control the bodily functions of a dead Subsidurial by thrusting its tentacles into the nervous system of the corpse. After doing so, it is able to use the Subsidurial's ability to traverse across Hyperspace."
	description "	Corpse Tricksters also have the ability to create hypnotic illusions, though the means by which it accomplishes this are a mystery. A favored tactic is creating an image of a Subsidurial to lure a fresh host. Alternatively, it might make multiple images of itself to intimidate and confuse other predators."

			`The exposed mantle of Hell's Maw is home to a thriving colony of these creatures. While they are content to harmlessly scavenge for minerals, they can become dangerous when provoked. One of their tendrils is able to emit electrical bursts which can disrupt a ship's power systems.`
		conversation
			`You wait until the exposed core is facing away from the sun and pick a landing spot near the edge of the planet's broken crust. Even at night the ambient heat here is intense, with temperatures slightly above the recommended safety limits for your environmental suit. Your ship's scanners alert you to the presence of several large life forms moving about on the rocky terrain below. Their appearance reminds you of jellyfish. While observing them consume the exposed minerals from the planet's gaping wound, you see occasional flashes of light when they create some form of energy discharge. Between the presence of these creatures and other environmental hazards, it's probably not a good idea to disembark.`
