Even at night the ambient heat here is intense, with temperatures slightly above the recommended safety limits for your environmental suit. Your ship's scanners alert you to the presence of several large life forms moving about on the rocky terrain below. Their appearance reminds you of jellyfish. While observing them consume the exposed minerals from the planet's gaping wound, you see occasional flashes of light when they create some form of energy discharge. Between the presence of these creatures and other environmental hazards, it's probably not a good idea to disembark.`
