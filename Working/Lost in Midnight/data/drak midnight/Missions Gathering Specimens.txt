It's an [ancient, historical] design updated with an ionic [resistant, protective] hull. Unfortunately, with the mass [construction, production] of the Hurricanes, the Wanderer leaders decided that the Storm Seeker won't be [desireable, necessary]. Only this experimental [exam, test] model was [created, produced]. Rather than let it be [trashed, scrapped], Sobari Tele'ek has decided to let you have it.
