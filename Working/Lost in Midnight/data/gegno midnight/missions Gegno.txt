Rather than settle in a bunk, the Gegno passenger stood close behind you in your cockpit the entire time. You occasionally turned to observe their behavior and even made attempts to communicate, but they wouldn't so much as look in your direction.`

You try to speak, but nothing comes out, and struggling your head, you turn to see that the alien has pierced you through your chest with their spear weapon. As your vision slowly fades, the last glimpse you could see of them wasn't a look of hatred, but one of disappointment.`

Noticing you, the alien yells something in a language you don't understand. The sound of distant explosions can be heard from the other side of the hatch. The Gegno gestures away from the hatch and screams the same words again! There's another explosion, louder than before and strong enough to feel in the floor boards. It might be a good idea to undock from the other ship...`

Pulling out what looks to be some sort of star map, they point to a location on it, gesture to themselves, then lower the device slowly to you. It seems they want to be taken to one of their species' planets. You could try to jettison your uninvited passenger out of the airlock, but there could be unforeseen consequences if the other Gegno witness you or find the body...`
