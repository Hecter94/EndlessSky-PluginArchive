	description "Dedicated cargo transports are no longer necessary among the Korath Exiles. Rather than being scrapped, these ships have been repurposed to serve as mobile prisons. Criminals convicted of serious crimes are given a choice between a quick death via a microbot nutrigel processor or a life long assignment working on a Far'itar mining vessel. Prisoners who fail to perform their duties are still eligible for being tossed into the nutrigel processor."
	description "	Operating these vessels can be lucrative for its captains, but the Korath authorities require them to activate their self destruct in the event of a mutiny or other event that could result in a prisoner escape. Whether or not they have the fortitude to fulfill this duty is put to the test whenever they engage in a boarding battle."
