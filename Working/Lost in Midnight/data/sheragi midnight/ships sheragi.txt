	description "Diamondbacks have been in use since explorers first settled the galactic rim. They've fought in various wars throughtout the centuries and few survive to this day. Those that have are so extensively customized that no two are alike."
	description "Some southern legends claim the Diamondbacks were wrecked spacecraft created by extinct aliens and salvaged by early explorers such as Han Sizer. There is no evidence to support these claims and no reputable scholar takes them seriously."
