	description "This is a Modified Blaster that has been disguised to resemble a Coalition Model Cannon. Some scanning interference is built into the weapon to help conceal its internal ciruitry. These weapons are popular with both criminals and dissidents within the Coalition, allowing them to covertly arm their ships without drawing attention from the Heliarchs."

	description "This is a turreted version of the Camouflaged Blaster, which is a Modified Blaster that has been disguised to resemble a Coalition Model Cannon. Due to the size differences, there is space within the weapon for even more scanning interference material. With enough of these turrets covering a ship, one can more easily sneak illegal cargo through Heliarch checkpoints."
