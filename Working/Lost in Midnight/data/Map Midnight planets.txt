Most of the structure is buried beneath the rocky surface of the asteroid, making the waystation inconspicuous to anyone looking at it from a distance.`

	landscape land/space0ver8
	description "Geminae was built only a few decades after Solus. Originally, Megaparsec intended for this to allow multiple races to take place at once. Demand for more challenging races lead to the shift towards races that used more than one checkpoint. This formed the basis for the foundation of what became the Geminae League."
	description "	Asteroids occasionally approach these checkpoints. Because of this, each is equipped with repulsors to either gently push the asteroids away or shift the structure's position to avoid the asteroid. While every effort is made to prevent an asteroid from passing through the center, racers should still be ready to dodge them if necessary."

	description "This artificial satellite is the first of the three Sunracer checkpoints. Solus has been in service since Megaparsec started sponsoring racing competitions in Mirfak. It is used in all three racing leagues as well as the qualifiers. Being the oldest checkpoint combined with its high rate of usage means that Solus needs more maintenance than Geminae or Tertio."
	description "	The checkpoint sends a secure transmission to ships registered in an active race as they pass through. This helps prevent anyone from swapping ships in the middle of a race. If someone were to transfer to a ship that isn't registered in an active race, the checkpoint won't verify it when that ship passes through."

	description "	Built over a century after Geminae, Tertio is exclusively used for large races that involve all three checkpoints. Competition in the Tertio League is fierce, with some pilots resorting to violence in these high stakes events."
	description "	Despite concerns of cheaters hacking the verification system, race officials insist that the transmissions are protected by the best secured encryption available. However, some racers claim to have experienced strange engine problems or system failures after passing through Tertio. No hackers have been caught, but the race commission has put rules in place to punish any offenders."

But the Hai's connection to Mah Duum remained.`

	description `Eureka Station was originally built as a processing facility and harvesting outpost during the early Deuterium Rush. It wasn't long before the station attracted the attention of pirates. After being captured, it remained under pirate control until shortly after the foundation of the Republic.`
	description `	When the Navy began its crackdown on pirate activities, Eureka was among the first of the outlaw havens to fall. After the Republic established control of the station, attempts were made to restart deuterium processing operations. Those plans came to an end with the Alpha war. The battle of Ipsing brought about the station's final downfall. A barrage of rocket fire knocked Eureka out of its established orbit. Since then it has remained an uninhabited derelict, slowly drifting towards the system's edge.`
	port "Docking Port"
		description `The damage that destroyed any hope of returning Eureka to its former glory has caused many sections of the station to either lack an atmosphere or be flooded with toxic chemicals released from the fuel processing equipment. Due to a malfunction in the environmental controls, the temperature in the few habitable areas is also near freezing. You can search the station for leftover fuel, but be wary of sealed doors that could lead to the open void or other hazards.`

Whether they were deactivated by the Hai who were operating the station or neutralized by some external force is a matter of contention between Hai and Unfettered historians.`

Strange interstellar creatures dart across the planet's innards, feasting on its exposed mineral deposits. While there are small traces of various gasses forming a thin atmosphere, many of them are toxic to a human. When the exposed core faces the sun, the heat below the edge of the broken crust exceeds recommended safety limits. With the additional dangers from the hazardous environment and wildlife, a heavy environmental suit is necessary to explore the area.`

	description `	Centuries after it was built, this station lies mostly forgotten. A small crew is on standby to protect the system, but the available facilities are inadequate for maintaining a proper garrison or offering services to outsiders. As a result, the station rarely gets visitors and the few Unfettered you encounter watch you with suspicion.`

The colony remained isolated until more efficient Hyperdrives were developed. By then, explorers curious about the fate of New America traveled there only to find abandoned ruins. The original colonists and their descendants had vanished. No human remains were left, leaving behind an unsolved mystery.`
	description `	Today, the few inhabitants of New America aren't known for their hospitality towards outsiders. The planet does not have a proper spaceport or anything resembling a central governing body.

Many sections of the ring are without power. Whether this is because the energy systems are malfunctioning or because the Quarg shut down the generators to preserve them for their eventual return is unknown.`

Most of the buildings have been demolished by some unknown force. As is typical for a Quarg world, the air is too thin for human comfort.`
	description `	The flashes of lightning from the nebula above serve as the main source of lighting on the planet's surface. The eerie glow occasionally flickers as activity shifts among the clouds, causing shadows cast by the ruins to dance about wildly.`
	spaceport `Since there is no sun to power your ramscoops, it is fortunate that you are able to find an abandoned spaceport with some stockpiled fuel to salvage here.`
	spaceport `	A few rusting derelict Quarg ships covered by thick frost occupy some of the other landing pads. Most show signs of combat damage. The corpses nearby give the impression that they were frantically trying to repair one of these ships when something caused an abrupt and violent end to their lives.

	description `The pirates who discovered this isolated system, and the secrets to using the alien device orbiting its sun to activate and deactivate the hyperspace links leading to the system, created this space station as a rest stop for those seeking refuge from Earth's authority. It also serves as a meeting place for those seeking to do business with the underworld or rival pirate factions in need of neutral ground.`
	description `	Control of the station has switched hands several times over the centuries. Most of the previous transfers of power were violent. However, the current administration, an organization known as the Red Dragons, bought its way in. They are an independent consortium involved in instellar smuggling operations throughout the galaxy.`
	spaceport `Many of the pirate ships parked here are being repaired. It's a wonder some of them were able to escape the Navy in the condition that they are in. Not everyone here is a pirate. More than a few freighters can be found intermingled with the interceptors and warships. There are also those who conduct business with pirates arriving and departing. Some seek transportation to the planet below while others are engaged in transportation of cargo to and from the station.`

	description `This earth-like planet is covered in decaying ruins. But they don't appear to be Hai ruins. On this world it seems another species evolved, thrived, then died out during the Hai's long absence. Wild animals roam the streets and flying creatures nest in the taller structures. Perhaps this is how Earth would turn out if humans ever abandoned it.`
