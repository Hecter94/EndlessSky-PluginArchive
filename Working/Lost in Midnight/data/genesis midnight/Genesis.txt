			`While some aircraft rise to meet you, they do not open fire. That's usually a good sign. Eventually, they guide you to an open space with enough room for your ship to land. When you disembark, a delegation steps forward from the growing crowd to greet you. Naturally, you don't understand a word they're saying. At first, you get the impression that there are two species co-habiting this world. One has thick fur covering their bodies from head to toe, while the other is bald with apparently no body hair whatsoever. It's only after studying the gathered crowd that you realize that all the ones with fur appear to be male, while all the ones that are bald appear to be female. The females actually almost look like bald humans, while the males remind you of actors wearing werewolf makeup in old earth movies.`
