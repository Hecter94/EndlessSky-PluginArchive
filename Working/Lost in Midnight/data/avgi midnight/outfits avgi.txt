	description "The three lasers mounted on this heavy turret are effective at smelting asteroids and harvesting other interstellar resources. They also generate more heat than most other Avgi lasers, both on the ship they are installed on as well as any ship they strike. An optical lasing generator is integrated into the weapon, contributing to its considerable size and weight."

	description "This heavy turret was designed during a time when the Avgi were still uncertain which wavelengths are ideal for defending against missiles. An integrated optical lasing generator cycles through the spectrum, creating a dazzling effect that greatly disrupts optical tracking systems."

	description "These shield emitters can be mounted conformally to a ship's hull, adding to the shield coverage of the hull surface by half. This causes the shield generators to work harder than they normally would, doubling all resource requirements to restore lost shields."
	description "	Deflector Laminae take advantage of special external hardpoints built into most Avgi ships, allowing them to be mounted without taking up any outfit space. However, they also tend to increase the amount of heat absorbed from the local star."
