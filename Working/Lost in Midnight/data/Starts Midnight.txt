The estate processor, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to inherit, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`

	`	The old man grins. "Don't worry, I'm not here to steal your spotlight. I'll just be acting as an advisor and assistant. You're still the one leading this mission." He turns towards the Conundrum. "So we're using a Modified Star Barge? I didn't expect the Syndicate to be so cheap."`
	`	The manager responds, "I assure you, the special equipment installed on it is worth more than the ship itself."`
