Checking your possessions, the only noteworthy item you have right now is your pilot's license. The bank indicates you have no outstanding loans, but as far as you can tell, you don't have a single ship to your name. It seems this is an alternate time line.`

	`The law office's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The reason you're here is to sign the paperwork that legally transfer ownership of the inheritance your uncle left behind to you. The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The estate processor, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to inherit, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when you reach the final page. Sign here." He grins.`

Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 4,693 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 812,945 credits in interest."`
	`	It takes a moment for you to realize he's not joking.`

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you step outside the law offices, you forget your troubles and start smiling. Parked before you is the Blood Rage, your ticket to getting off this planet.`

Its weapons layout is different from the standard Berserker. The weapons pods on the wingtips have been converted into cargo pods while a gun has been installed in the ship's foreward section.

	`It was twelve months ago when the pirate raid destroyed a Behemoth in orbit over your home planet. Most people ran from the crash sites as debris rained down from the sky. But there were some people who ran into the crash zone. Scavengers. Looters. And people like you, hoping to find salvageable parts to build a space ship. Now, twelve months later, it's complete.`
	`	The hangar security system asks for a password. You wanted to keep this simple, so you made sure it would be a password you wouldn't forget: your name:`

	`	You salvaged everything you could that night twelve months ago. Bought parts others salvaged. Took loans when you ran out of money and needed to rent this hangar. But the result of that effort is parked before you: The Gremlin. There aren't any weapons, but it should be a fast ship, able to outrun just about anything. You'll need that speed. Hauling cargo can be dangerous work, with pirates on the prowl. And you'll need to start finding work: Your first loan payment is due tomorrow.`

People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
			`The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`

Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space.`
