A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`

The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The estate processor, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to inherit, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`

Unfortunately the effective range is so low you might not realize an asteroid is minable until you're practically on top of it.`

The weapons pods on the wingtips have been converted into cargo pods while a gun has been installed in the ship's foreward section. You note the guns mounted on the ship are two different sizes.
