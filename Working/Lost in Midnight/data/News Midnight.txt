			"What are you looking at, punk?"
			"Hobbes and Darwin got it right: it's a war of all against all, and only the strongest deserve to survive. Without that pistol at your side, I'd slit your throat right now and take everything you own."
			"Slaves for sale! Slaves for sale! Here is an exotic beauty with eyes full of fire that you can buy!"

			"Sometimes I wonder if what I'm doing is wrong."

			"Just watch yourself, and maybe we'll let you live."
			"At half your age, I was richer than you'll ever be. This is the life, baby."

			"Betcha I can name a combat use for every ship in the sky. Flivver? Might as well be a Sparrow. Freighter? Umm... it works as a great plundering vessel. Surveillance drone? Don't make me shoot you."
			"Bah. How can you not gag at the suffocating rules that the Republic forces onto you? I mean, banning chickens with dynamite strapped to them? Ridiculous!"
			"Yo, yo, yo, what's up, suckers! I'm high on ${contraband}! Wanna freebie? No? Coward!"
			"You look like a good captain. I'd bet you'd be a better slave!"
			"Hmph. You 'freelancers' have it easy, relying on the Navy as a crutch. If you wanna be your own captain, you've gotta strike out on your own!"
			"Ever heard of the game Mafia? My life's a real-life version of that, 'cept instead of a town, there's merchants, and instead of a mafia, there's us, and the town has no way to survive!"
			"Look at me like that one more time, and I'll give you plastic surgery free of charge."
			"Crime pays, and the hours are good!"
			"I'll retire as a security adviser in the Paradise Worlds. You know the saying: An old poacher makes the best gamekeeper."
			"Hey, that's a very nice ship you have there. Would be a shame if something happened to it. Do you want to make a donation to the System Safety Fund?"
			"Your credits or your life! Oh, you don't have either? Never mind then."
			"Don't count on the Navy to save you if me or any of my friends attack you. Those Navy goons only hang around near the rich planets."
			"Did I attack you? Well, I've attacked many people, could you be a bit more specific?"
			"The size of my crimes no longer matter; one may as well hang for a sheep as for a lamb."
			"Hey! We have this new Piracy As A Service offering. Want someone ambushed without incriminating yourself? Just tell me who, where, and how much it's worth to you."
			"I don't get it; if I donate a kidney, then I'm some sort of hero. But if I donate 7 kidneys, then suddenly I'm some sort of monster."
			"I wasn't close to my parents when they died. Which was quite fortunate, since they died in an exploding ship."
			"I hate double standards; burn a body in a crematorium and you're a professional, burn a body in a spaceship and you're a criminal."
			"I missed my lover during the raids today. But only by a few inches; next time I'll aim better."
			"I once prayed to God for a new ship, but quickly found out He doesn't roll that way. So then I hijacked one and prayed for his forgiveness."
			"Living on the edge."
			"You can't win the game if you're afraid to lose it."
