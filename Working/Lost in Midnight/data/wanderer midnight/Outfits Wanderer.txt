	description "A primitive version of the modern Thunderhead Launcher. The Thunderhead Pod is almost entirely dependent on external ammunition storage, resulting in a slower rate of fire. Unlike the modern launchers, these pods do not fire simultaneously when multiples are installed on a ship."

	description "The Thunderhead Storage Depot stages extra ammunition in your cargo bay for weapons that use Thunderhead Missiles. The ammunition is ready to be withdrawn for use. Storing it this way uses more cargo space than if it were packed away in sealed crates. An extra crewmember is required to oversee maintenance of the ammunition."
