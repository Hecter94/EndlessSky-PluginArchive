When you disembark, a delegation steps forward from the growing crowd to greet you. Naturally, you don't understand a word they're saying. At first, you get the impression that there are two species co-habiting this world. One has thick fur covering their bodies from head to toe, while the other is bald with apparently no body hair whatsoever. It's only after studying the gathered crowd that you realize that all the ones with fur appear to be male, while all the ones that are bald appear to be female. The females actually look like bald humans, while the males remind you of actors in old earth movies wearing werewolf makeup.`

		description `The Saryds are the only known species who successfully visited another world when their technology was still in the age of steam. The scientist who first landed here was piloting a ramshackle rocket ship of dizzying complexity. Modern analysis of his plans indicates that his flight had less than a one in ten thousand chance of success. This has led to speculation that he was either secretly assisted by friendly aliens, or completely insane, or possibly both.`
