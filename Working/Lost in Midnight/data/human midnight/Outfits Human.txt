This can make energy usage by certain outfits more efficient while also alleviating effects that negatively impact your ship. A skilled engineering crew who understands how these systems work and interact with each other is essential to Engineering Room operations."
	description "	Engineering Rooms are also often the location where a ship's self-destruct sequence is activated. Typically it involves deliberately causing a reactor meltdown in the ship's power systems or some similar catastrophic failure. At a minimum, this usually requires the cooperation of both the captain and the engineering crew."

	description `This outfit is sometimes referred to as the "Berserker Circuit" after the first ship it was used in. Many consider the development of this device a reckless attempt to push a ship's combat abilities to its maximum limits. But installing a Limit Breaker on your ship allows it to keep functioning well past the point that it would be disabled due to internal safety mechanisms shutting your systems down.`
#	description `	However, using this isn't without risk. If your ship continues fighting a hopeless battle after it would normally be disabled, you are unlikely to be left adrift in space afterwards waiting for someone to come rescue you... Because you'd be dead.`

	description "The D14-RN Shield Generator is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."
