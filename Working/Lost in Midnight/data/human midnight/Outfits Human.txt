	description `This guidebook instructs the reader on how to abuse the cargo scan fining system by hacking into a drone's scanners. Contrary to the title, it works on any drone set up for scanning cargo or outfits. One important detail buried in the text is that the drone must not be hostile towards you.`

	description "Despite its name, an Engineering Room has little to do with engines. Instead, it acts as a centralized control center for regulating the flow of energy on your ship. This can make energy usage by certain outfits more efficient while also alleviating effects that would drain your energy reserves. Of course, a skilled engineer who understands how these systems work and interact with each other is essential to Engineering Room operations."
	description "	Engineering Rooms are also often the location where a ship's self-destruct sequence is activated. Typically it involves deliberately causing a reactor meltdown in the ship's power systems or some similar catastrophic failure. This usually requires the cooperation of both the captain and the second in command."
