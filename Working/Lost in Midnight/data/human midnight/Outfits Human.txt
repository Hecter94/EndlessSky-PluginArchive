This can make energy usage by certain outfits more efficient while also alleviating effects that negatively impact your ship. A skilled engineering crew who understands how these systems work and interact with each other is essential to Engineering Room operations."
	description "	Engineering Rooms are also often the location where a ship's self-destruct sequence is activated. Typically it involves deliberately causing a reactor meltdown in the ship's power systems or some similar catastrophic failure. At a minimum, this usually requires the cooperation of both the captain and the engineering crew."

	description `This outfit is sometimes referred to as the "Berserker Circuit" after the first ship it was used in. Many consider the development of this device a reckless attempt to push a ship's combat abilities to its maximum limits. But installing a Limit Breaker on your ship allows it to keep functioning well past the point that it would be disabled due to internal safety mechanisms shutting your systems down.`
#	description `	However, using this isn't without risk. If your ship continues fighting a hopeless battle after it would normally be disabled, you are unlikely to be left adrift in space afterwards waiting for someone to come rescue you... Because you'd be dead.`

Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."
	description "	Modifications to this outfit have increased its rate of shield generation. However it consumes considerably more energy while also generating heat as a result of being pushed to perform beyond the intended specifications it was designed for.

	description "Papa Grudge's custom weapon. It emits a cone of blistering heat, making it difficult for the enemy to maintain a defensive position. While not immediately lethal, prolonged exposure can cause blindness, disfigurement, and ultimately leads to a slow and agonizing death. This sort of weapons modification violates several consumer safety laws and regulations, so don't expect to find one of these for sale at any legitimate outfitter."

	description "	In all his travels, Han never did find the door. Or perhaps he did but never shared the knowledge of what lay beyond. Most scholars familiar with the tale have concluded that some, if not all, aspects of this story are completely fabricated."
