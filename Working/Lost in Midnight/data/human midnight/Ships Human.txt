	description "The technology on the Starcadia, while in line with other modern ships, is surprisingly mundane for a newly deployed ship from the Deep.

Alternatively, conspiracy theorists suggest that the Deep has been sitting on this design for some time and is only releasing it now in preparation for some threat unknown to the general public. Deep Security, for its part, has no comment on these rumors."

	description "The Liberator is a new warship that was originally designed by Southbound Shipyards to replace the Skein. Rumor has it that the project scope shifted focus during development when a ship of alien origin was discovered at the edges of the Rim. As a result, the planned fighter bays were scrapped in favor of the concentrated fire mount. This design crams all of the ship's gun ports into a single central location, allowing multiple smaller guns to emulate the effect of having a single larger one. This negatively impacts the ship's cooling efficiency and increases the amount of work maintenance crews have to put in for guns not mounted on the edge of the firing cluster."

Many claim the Star Explorer's design was heavily influenced by an old Earth science-fiction show as a marketing gimmick to entice young people to leave Sol and risk their lives exploring the vast unknown. Of the few that haven't been lost or destroyed, there are some still being used as actual science and exploration vessels. The rest are held in private collections by fans of antiquities."

	description "The Municipality comprises the forward section of a Metropolis ship. It is the only section with forward firing gun ports. However, it has the least cargo and outfit space of the three sections. Special sensor equipment was integrated into the foremost part of the ship to aid in planetary exploration and mapping. One of its two fighter bays was modified to host a pair of drones."
