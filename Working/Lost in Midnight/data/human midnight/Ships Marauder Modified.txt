	description `Occasionally a pirate gets the idea in his head to adapt a ship not designed for warfare into a pirate vessel. Oftentimes the results weren't worth the effort. But some of these attempts manage to find a niche. A Modified Hogshead might appear under the command of bounty hunters or slavers who are likely to find a ship of this type useful in their line of work.`
	description `	Over half the passenger space on this Hogshead has been gutted to make room for more shield emitters and weapon systems to power the two additional gun ports. Thick armored plating has been welded over the passenger viewports and other vulnerable areas of the hull, making the ship heavier, but more durable.`
