Eventually, those of us who were not prepared for the toll of fighting a war lost the will to fight. Unfortunately for us, we could no longer go home. When Benedict got his hands on some jump drives, he assigned us to these ships and ordered us to explore the region beyond the rim. We were uncertain of our future at first, but the Coalition has been very welcoming towards us. We will not start a fight with you in the presence of the Heliarch.
