In addition to a reinforced turret mount, the Particle Burst Turret limits the rate of fire to a three shot burst. Lab results have been satisfactory so far, but actual combat testing is needed."

	description "The Meteor Missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space, with only rudimentary infrared tracking systems that can have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. True to its name, the missile reaches a very high speed to leave its target's anti-missile defenses with little time to react. The trade-off is maneuverability, so Meteor Missiles are practically useless against agile targets farther than point-blank range."
	description "	This alternative to the Meteor Missile Launcher was in common use centuries ago. With the widespread adoption of Torpedo technology, the Twin Meteor Launcher is considered an antiquated design."
	description "	This weapon will jam if there isn't enough ammunition to fire a full volley."

	description "Torpedoes are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge."
	description "	At first glance this looks like a regular Torpedo Launcher. But a closer inspection reveals that these are a pair of Torpedo Pods jury rigged to be crammed into a single gunport. Both are programmed to activate simultaneously, launching a pair of Torpedos when fired."
