	description "One of the most frequent product requests submitted to Lovelace Labs is for a turreted version of the Particle Cannon. While none have made it past the prototype testing phase before, this version looks promising. A major issue in previous designs was jamming in the turret turning mechanism due to the stress of the firing recoil. In addition to reinforcing the turret mount, the Particle Burst Turret limits the rate of fire to a three shot burst. While lab results have been satisfactory so far, actual field testing is required to determine if this approach has fully eliminated the turret turning issue."
