			`Mara pays you the agreed upon payment of <payment> and disembarks from your ship without a word. All her charm at the beginning of the journey has mysteriously disappeared.`
			`	As she is walking away from your ship a squad of spaceport security officers swarm around her and place her in handcuffs! One of the officers approaches you.`
			`	"Captain <first> <last>?" he asks. You nod an affirmative. "Were you aware that you were transporting a dangerous fugitive?" You shake your head to disavow. "Well," he says, "given your past history with the Grudge crime family, I suppose we can overlook this. That woman is Mama Grudge. I'm still going to have to ask you to submit your ship for inspection. Trust me, it's for your own safety."`
			`	The inspection takes hours. Somehow, Mama Grudge left bombs, alien parasites, nerve gas, and various other traps aboard your ship. The spaceport security team assures you that the ship has been cleared of all the traps and should be safe to fly again. You hope they didn't miss anything...`

			`	As she drags you to the kitchen, you hear one of the other patrons gasp "Isn't that Mama Grudge? Did she escape from prison?"`
			`	But she quickly has you through the kitchen door, away from the crowd. "I thought about you every day since we last met. I couldn't believe my luck when I noticed you had walked into this bar!" Alone with this mad woman and unable to move, you hear the sound of metal being sharpened. "Fresh ingredients are important for operating a restaurant on a space station." She whispers in your ear with glee. Mama Grudge then proceeded to carve you up for her next recipe...`
