He pauses to make a great big yawn. "I suppose I've had enough excitement for one day. Figuring out how to unlock those binding clamps will have to wait until tomorrow. For now, I just want to rest. Go on back to the party. I'll be fine. I have an assistant I can call to fetch me when I'm done here."`
			`	You congratulate Joseph on a job well done and thank him for giving you the opportunity to be a part of his dream. The last time you saw him, he was staring out over the spaceport.`
			choice
				`	(Tomorrow...)`
			`	He had a look of contentment on his face that you will never forget. The next day you received the news that he'd passed away in his sleep. The crews for the Balthazar and Melchior were especially distraught, since they'd spent more time with him during the wait for Caspar to be found. A funeral was quickly organized as most of his friends and family were already in the area for yesterday's celebration. Through their tears, many of them thanked you for helping him to make his dream a reality.`
			`	The Exodus crew had their own reactions to this turn of events.`
			`	After that day, the Wigglebottoms stopped arguing. If Cathleen and Richard ever did argue, you never heard about it. From what you could discern, Joseph had taken a fatherly sort of role to them during the time they spent with him. Perhaps his passing brought back memories of their own father.`
			`	Tyler Maverick withdrew from taking the lead. He'd been no stranger to death, having lived on a pirate ship for the past few years. But this was the first time he'd experienced the death of someone whose life seemed to matter to the people around him. It was a strange feeling that he would need time to sort out.`
			`	So it was that Tyler stepped down while Maria Carpenter ascended to take a leadership role. With Joseph's guidance, she'd already been acting as a chief engineer of sorts. Now that he's gone, she felt a certain responsibility for maintaining the ship in his honor.`
			`	His dream will live on.`
			`	It's time for the Exodus to fly again.`
