Just take it to a recycler and tell then you want it compacted into roughly the same size and shape as the asteroids you normally use.`

			`The recycler charges you <payment> for processing the junk metal. When they're done, you have 30 compacted clumps of metal. Once you get the load back to your ship, you test them. Unfortunately, they aren't magnetic so you can't use them! In the end, you manage to scrape together 30 tons of aluminum from the metal clumps.`
