Various political machinations went into effect. Before you had even set foot in a courtroom, an under the table deal was negotiated between the Republic, the Free Worlds, and the Syndicate. All weapons research involving asteroids were banned. So there's no way I'm getting involved. If you're determined, you'll just have to find someone else to help you with it."`
