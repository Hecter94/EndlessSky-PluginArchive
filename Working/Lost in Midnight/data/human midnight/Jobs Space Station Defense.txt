# Jobs defending space stations. The station participates in the battle and preventing its destruction is required to succeed. Originally intended for failure to result in #removing the station from the map. While this can be done, I concluded that the potential "feel bads" from broken missions involving the station isn't worth the risk. So failure results in "death" instead.
