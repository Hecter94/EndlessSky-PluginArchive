# Jobs defending space stations. The station participates in the battle and preventing its destruction is required to succeed. Originally intended for failure to result in removing the station from the map. While this can be done, I concluded that the potential "feel bads" from broken missions involving the station isn't worth the risk. So failure results in "death" instead.

#     UNINHABITED ERROR: 
#     version 0.10.5 of Endless Sky introduced an error
#     that does not resolve events removing or overwriting
#     the "uninhabited" attribute from planets. This causes
#     the planet to not have the trading, job board, and hiring
#     panel restored after completing the space station
#     defense job.
#
#     An issue has been opened regarding this bug:
#     https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/10051
#
#     This version of Lost in Midnight no longer adds the
#     uninhabited attribute for these missions. New pilots
#     doing these missions for the first time will be not be
#     affected by this error.
#
#     For pilots that completed these missions in previous versions
#     of Lost in Midnight that have this issue, it cannot be fixed with
#     a patch since the error in the game code causes it to not recognize
#     the updates to the planet attributes in the save file. If this
#     error is fixed in a future update to Endless Sky, edits to your
#     save file should be unnecessary.
#
#     To fix this error for those pilots immediately instead of waiting
#     for an Endless Sky update, it is necessary to manually edit the
#     "changes" section in the save file by deleting the lines that adds
#     the uninhabited attribute to the planet.
#
#     Example line to delete from the changes section of your save file:
#
#      |	planet <station name>
#      |		add attributes uninhabited	<--delete this line
#      |		government Uninhabited
