The owner of this Manta rectified that, added some extra armor plating and shield emitters, and rearranged some of the internals to yield a little more outfit space. Dry tonnage alone keeps it from being classified as a heavy warship.`

	description `A previous owner of this Manta has gone to great lengths to make sure they could bring all six gun ports to bear in a hurry, and chase down smaller warships. Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`
