	description `A previous owner of this Manta has gone to great lengths to make sure they could bring all six gun ports to bear in a hurry, and chase down smaller warships. Style was not lost on that captain, and a forked tail yielded a little more space for shield projectors in an area that would have been destabilized by engine exhaust. If its dry tonnage were any higher, it would be classified as a heavy warship.`

A third engine bay, more outfit space, additional shield emitters, and a turret make this already deadly warship appear even more frightening."

Besides adding a turret, this ship has enormous gun ports, making you wonder how much more deadly you could possibly make a warship this small."
