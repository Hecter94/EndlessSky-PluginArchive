Someone decided that welding it onto the side of an intact Barb could convert it into a deceptively lightweight short range interceptor.`

	description "This Quicksilver has even more space available for engine use - and even another thruster port! It's also got a few extra shield projectors, more hull plating, and another bunk. This aftermarket model also features a turret mount, perhaps in response to Lionheart's Headhunter. Whoever modified this ship wanted to chase their prey down with vicious speed."

	description "Lionheart's elegant Raven has gained popularity with pirates because of its agility. This one appears to have been modified for even more of the latter at the expense of the former, and the central hull can only be recognized as a Raven because of the wings. A third engine bay, more outfit space, additional shield emitters, and a turret make this already deadly warship appear even more frightening."
