	description `This Kvelqde variant is designed to optimize the use of "Myiara" Fire Spouts. There are whispers that those who pilot such vessels are patron servants of a secret House that manipulates events from the shadows. Within the respectable echelons of Successor society such tales are dismissed as mere superstition, no more real than the monster from a children's poem.`
