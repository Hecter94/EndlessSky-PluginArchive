	description "Geminae was built only a few years after Solus. Originally, Megaparsec intended for this to allow multiple races to take place at once. Demand for more challenging races lead to the shift towards races that used more than one checkpoint. This formed the basis for the foundation of what became the Geminae League."
	description "	Asteroids occasionally approach these checkpoints. Because of this, each is equipped with repulsors to either gently push the asteroids away or shift the structure's position to avoid the asteroid. While every effort is made to prevent an asteroid from passing through the center, racers should still be ready to dodge them if necessary."

	description "This artificial satellite is the first of the three Sunracer checkpoints. Solus has been in service since Megaparsec started sponsoring racing competitions in Mirfak. It is used in all three racing leagues as well as the qualifiers. Being the oldest checkpoint combined with its high rate of usage means that Solus needs more maintenance than Geminae or Tertio."
	description "	The checkpoint sends a secure transmission to ships registered in an active race as they pass through. This helps prevent anyone from swapping ships in the middle of a race. If someone were to transfer to a ship that isn't registered in an active race, the checkpoint won't verify it when that ship passes through."

	description "	While there are concerns of cheaters hacking the verification system, race officials claim that the transmissions are protected by the best secured encryption available. Despite this, some racers claimed to have experienced strange engine problems or system failures after passing through Tertio. No hackers have been caught, but the race commission has put rules in place to punish any offenders."

	description `	When the Navy began its crackdown on pirate activities, Eureka Station was among the first of the outlaw havens to fall. After the Republic established control of the station, attempts were made to restart deuterium processing operations. Those plans came to an end with the Alpha war. The battle of Ipsing brought about the station's final downfall. A barrage of rocket fire sent Eureka out of its established orbit. Since then it has remained an uninhabited derelict, slowly drifting towards the system's edge.`

Due to a malfunction in the environmental controls, the temperature in the few habitable areas is also near freezing. You can search the station for leftover fuel, but be wary of sealed doors that could lead to the open void or other hazards.`
