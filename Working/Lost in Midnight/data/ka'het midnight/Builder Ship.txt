	description "Featuring the Builders best ramscoop technology with integrated fuel stabilizers and storage tanks, the Ool'mar was specifically designed for the purpose of harvesting and transporting hyperspace fuel. With the collapse of the Builder civilization, there was no longer any need to harvest fuel. Most Ool'mar can be found wandering aimlessly, unable to off load the contents of their fuel tanks because Builder stations lack the capacity to accept their cargo."
