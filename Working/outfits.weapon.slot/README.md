### outfits.weapon.slot
<br>
<br>
Adds several non-weapon outfits for gun and turret ports. See the README for details.<br>
<br>
These outfits use an empty gun or turret port and add stats like fuel, cargo, bunks etc.<br>
Half the outfits are designed by timeout.fu and he did an overall balancing of all outfits (thx).<br>
Currently there are 7 gun port outfits and 6 turret port outfits. Available on Glaze, Valhalla, Wayfarer, Luna and Sunracer.<br>
