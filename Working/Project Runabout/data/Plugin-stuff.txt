After researching certain feats of Wanderer and Deep technology however, Project Runabout has come up with this device. While the techno-organic hyperspace fuel the specialized pseudo-bacteria in this device create is more effective than the normally used fuel, resulting in a virtual increase of fuel capacity, a metabolic ramscoop also requires a bit of energy to keep those organisms alive."
