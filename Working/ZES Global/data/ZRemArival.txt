	# description "After the Blackbird gained surprising popularity as an agile light warship despite its original design as a transport, Tarazed decided to produce a new design specifically intended as a warship. The Osprey was the result. Although it is considered overpriced by most savvy pilots, it is nevertheless a perennial favorite among those who have the extra cash to spend on it."
