# This file is intended to focus on changes to the mass and drag of ship hulls such as to alter the manouverability and interplay between different ships. The general intention is to give ships a bigger range of manouverability. Predominantly this is aiming to increase the speed, acceleration, and/or turning of ships I think should be faster. Probably will be only slowing down ships that are egregious in how fast they are for their perceived or described sizes. 
#
# It is worth noting that I favor a shift towards realism. Not necessarily making things perfectly realistic, but shifting things in that direction. For example: There is, technically speaking, no speed limits in space. The concept of "Max Speed" is entirely a fictional creation of the game. True realism would dictate a system whereby there is no max speed, and all ships can accelerate infinitely... but limited by a curve whereby the faster a ship is moving, the more thrust it takes to accelerate it farther. In practice, it should take (in game terms) infinite thrust to actually reach the speed of light. This would take some significant changes to the games mechanics, so I'm not doing that.
#
# What I am doing, however, is changing things around so that ships that theoretically have a very high engine to mass ratio (aka fighters, racers, blockade runners, and other ships that are built for speed will tend to have higher acceleration and turn rates.
#
# My very first ship on the list, though, is the Bactrian. Which I feel has *far* too good a manouverability for a flying city.

# - The Bactrian, which gets +20% hull mass instead because for a so-called city, it is far too light and has too much combat potential already). Worth noting that this actually help it resist impacts by force weapons and improves its heat capacity. So this isn't necessarily a bad thing.
