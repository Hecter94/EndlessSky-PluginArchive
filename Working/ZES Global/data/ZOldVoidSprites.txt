# This file is intended to focus on changes to the mass and drag of ship hulls such as to alter the manouverability and interplay between different ships. The general intention is to give ships a bigger range of manouverability. Predominantly this is aiming to increase the speed, acceleration, and/or turning of ships I think should be faster. Probably will be only slowing down ships that are egregious in how fast they are for their perceived or described sizes.
