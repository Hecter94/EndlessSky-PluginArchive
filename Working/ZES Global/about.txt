# ZESglobal
Zitchas's Endless Sky Global mod. This is a collection of files intended to change the general feel of the game. These files and changes are intended to be complimentary and used together, but you are welcome to pick and choose which changes you want.

ZOutfitSpace: Increases the outfit space of most ships.
ZMobility: Alters the manouverability balance of the game.
ZRemnantStart: disabled. Will have a Remnant start once that PR is implemented.
ZRemArrival: disabled. Will have a starting point at Ingot in an Osprey with a quantum keystone.
