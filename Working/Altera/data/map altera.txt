planet Asuras
	landscape land/city6
	description `Asuras is the most populous of the Alteran worlds and an unchallenged industrial center with over 20 billion inhabitants. Unlike most Alteran core worlds, there doesn’t seem to be much beauty to be found. Large factory complexes can be found everywhere, and the residential sections are designed for mass housing, rather than looks. There is little greenery to be found in the cities themselves.`
	description `	During the last Alteran war, Asuras was the target if intense bombing and while nature has recovered, sometimes even more than before, the same can’t be said for the inhabited parts of the planet. Although that is in part due to the decentralization plan, implemented after the war.`
	spaceport `In part due to the traffic and in part for efficiency’s sake, several spaceports were sprinkled around the planet. One of them, usually considered the main spaceport, is located in the administrative capital of the planet. It is as disgusting as it is massive and is made up of simple, purpose-built hangars and terminals, surrounded by large multi-purpose landing pads.`

planet Atlantis
	landscape land/beach11-harro
	description `On this planet, mostly covered in water, floating in the middle of the ocean is the city of Atlantis, a former and presumably still functional Alteran city-ship. It follows a general star shape with arms several kilometers in length with towering skyscrapers on top. Due to both the history and topography of this world, it’s still the population center, in fact, apart from a few settlements around the coastal areas in proximity to Atlantis there really isn’t much going on. No actual manufacturing and very little mining, instead, the nature is practically untouched.`
	description `	Being a ship, the city is equipped with a shield system, as well as several other defensive measures. During the last war, the Atlantis was submerged in its entirety, making it an unviable target and an incredibly safe location, resulting in exorbitant housing prices, quite similar to the human paradise worlds.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is placed around the city on its arms and appears to be well guarded, not only by the military personnel present, but also by the air support checking every ship before landing. Unlike your usual human spaceport, everything is highly organized here and almost eerily quiet, the personnel immediately take care of both yourself and your fleet.`
	spaceport `	Even the landing terminal is unnecessarily luxurious in design and not a single step behind the rest of the city.  The spaceport bar is very well located, offering great views of the spaceport and the surrounding ocean. The food and drinks here leave nothing to be desired, even considering the prices.`

planet Aurelis
	landscape land/dmottl1
	description `Aurelis, part of the innermost system of the Alteran Sector, is a mineral rich world that is stuck in an almost permanent winter. Its oceans and hills are covered by ice throughout most of the year. Despite all the snow and ice, it carries a sizeable population, heavily engaged in mining operations.`
	description `	The Alteran Military also has a heavy presence on Aurelis. Aurelis’ gravity is particularly strong, which caused problems initially, but has resulted in a genetically different, unusually well-built population. As such, the planet is very attractive for the army, as grounds for both training and recruitment of foot soldiers.`
	spaceport `Landing in the Aurelis spaceport is actually quite difficult, the port itself isn't too big or busy, but the low temperatures and the regular snowfall cause the spaceport to be buried under snow for most of the time. The spaceport agency on Aurelis is unable to keep up with the snow during storms and their immediate aftermath. To combat this, the spaceport was expanded with a heated section, however, due to the costs involved, the local government has decided against rebuilding the whole spaceport to install this system everywhere.`

planet Celestis
	landscape land/city7
	description `Celestis is a highly populous and economically powerful world, with a significant portion of its wealth and power stemming from its position as the Alteran capital world. It's located at the center of the original Alteran territory. For a planet this densely populated, it is covered in a very large amount amounts of both natural and artificial greenery. Significant portions of the planet are left practically untouched, and the ocean is as clean as could be.`
	description `	Being the Alteran capital, Celestis is the seat of government for the Alteran Inner Core and Altera as a whole. The governmental complex is not too far from the spaceport, right next to the waterfront and is generally busy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an architectural masterpiece, both beautiful and efficient, more than capable of handling the business it gets. It’s positioned on an artificial extension into the ocean, giving a great view of the city while descending.`
	spaceport `	Rather than building up, the Alterans decided to go down, so the majority of the spaceport is located beneath the ocean. The landing pads also act as lifts, moving ships into the lower levels, where they can be parked while the other vessels land and take off up top.`
	spaceport `	Apart from the landing pads, there a several buildings topside, most notably an air control tower, with a bar on one of the upper floors.`

planet Dakara
	landscape land/badlands0
	description `Dakara is a very rocky and sandy world, used almost exclusively for mining purposes. It used to be far greener, but ended up a bit too close to the sun, resulting in higher temperatures and little rainfall. Members of the resident population can be easily recognized by their darker skintone, compared to the usual, almost white, Alteran skintone.`
	description `	The buildings have only few windows and large air-conditioners and garages on their roofs, to reduce heat and radiation damage coming from the sun. To take it a step further, the designeres of the initial building strategy ensured that even the tiniest building can be reached either by a protected above-ground walkway or an underground path.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located in a hill, right next to the city, with what looks like a landing strip leading the spaceships into the hill. Even though the spaceport is located underground, it doesn't feel cramped at all and considering that this is a mining world's spaceport, it is suprisingly clean and most certainly less dusty than outside. Its underground location improves insulation and cooling efficiency, resulting in an almost pleasant temperature. Unsuprisingly, the view is rather limited.`

planet Draconis
	landscape land/city14-sfiera
	description `Draconis is the eastern co-capital of the Alteran Empire. It was initially used for regular mining, as it was a mineral rich world. Then Draconium was discovered on this world, making it one of the few worlds with known deposits of Draconium. There are multiple large cities located on the main continent and some of the larger mining complexes can even be seen from space.`
	description `	At this point, Draconis is no longer just a mining world, but has been appointed as the seat of one of the progenitors, who rule the eastern space from here. It is one of the most populated and economically strongest worlds of the Alterans.`
	spaceport `Multiple spaceports can be found on Draconis, though the commercial one is by far the largest. It appears to be very busy, but the Alteran government has imposed strict traffic regulations, resulting in an efficient, high capacity spaceport. The spaceport bar is located right next to a park, making it a very attractive and surprisingly quiet location.`

	description `Elarum lies in the Selphius system, only two jumps from Altera and has profited greatly from its position as the direct connection between the Alteran core and the Borean sector.`
	description `	The system of Selphius lies on the Alteran Ember Line, a set of systems whose stars show properties similar those in the Ember Waste. The star at the center of this system is dying and the effects can already be felt on Elarum, which has put an end to the planet’s economic boom.`
	spaceport `As the dying star has gotten rather unstable, the spaceport has recently undergone several modifications to counter sudden bursts of radiation. Most of the landing pads are covered by shield systems with a short activation procedure.`

planet "Forta Dracone"
	landscape land/nasa0
	description `Considering the importance of Draconis and its Draconium deposits, the moon orbiting Draconis is used as a large military base, protecting not only the Draconis, but also the surrounding systems from potential threats. While the moon looks barren from space, it is actually inhabitable and a few navy owned farms can be seen while landing.`
	spaceport `The spaceport looks exactly as expected from a military spaceport, a miriad of landing pads with a slightly lesser number of large hangars and large roads connecting them. Nearly all of the ships here are warships, except for a few freighters, most of which belong to the navy as well. Surprisingly, the personnel appears to be very friendly to anyone visiting here.`

planet Halcyon
	landscape land/fields6
	description `Halcyon is the most expensive Alteran world, overshadowing even Atlantis. It's one of the few terraformed Alteran worlds and very sparsely populated. There is a small city, located around the public spaceport, but a significant part of the population is spread around the planet in large estates.`
	spaceport `The public spaceport was designed specifically to demonstrate the wealth of the people on Halcyon. It is much larger than necessary and has any luxury you could imagine. A significant portion of the foot traffic is made up of spaceport personnel, tasked with caring for the arrivals and departures, guiding them and handling their luggage.`
	spaceport `	Unlike on most Alteran worlds, the spaceport only sees part of the traffic. Due to the rich and spread-out population, many ships head directly to private landing pads at the estates.`

planet Heliopolis
	landscape land/city2
	description `The third of the Alteran Inner Core worlds, Heliopolis, is a very sunny world, with surprisingly mild temperatures. As with most of the Alteran Core, Heliopolis is a densely populated world and of great importance to the Alteran economy. It was among the first worlds to be settled and predates the time of the Alteran city ships.`
	description `	Similar to other Alteran worlds, the cities are made up of mid-range skyscrapers and parks. The public transport network is well planned out, efficient and reliable, resulting in very little traffic on the roads. In fact, the majority of roads have more park area than actual road.`
	description `	As part of the Inner Core, Heliopolis was an important but well protected target during the last war. It was left practically untouched, with the memorials being the only reminder of the war.`
	spaceport `The main spaceport on Heliopolis looks like it was grown over time and not built as one piece, resulting in a somewhat Frankenstein-like landing area with even different surfaces for the landing pads and green areas of all shapes and sizes mixed in. It does have a certain wild beauty to it that other Alteran spaceports tend to lack, as they are highly organized and planned out.`
	spaceport `	A large park surrounds the spaceport on three sides, with the fourth side bordering a river and its promenade, likely in order to keep the spaceport's noise pollution down. From the bar, located in a corner between the promenade and the park, you have a gorgeous view of not only the main city and its spaceport, but also the sunset behind the skyline.`

planet Linirea
	landscape land/forest2
	description `Part of the Alteran Outer Core, Linirea was a prime target during the last war. It's position as one of three entrances to the Alteran Core and close proximity to Celestis makes it strategically important. During the pre-war tensions, the local capital was designated a fortress city and subsequently re-built over a relatively short time span. The result was a city following a grid pattern, capable of lowering the buildings underground, to keep the populace safe from bombings.`
	description `	Linirea has a rather warm climate and a green landscape, filled with forests and rolling hills. The local wildlife is mostly harmless and peaceful, making it a fairly popular world to live on.`
	description `	While Wyvernhaven is only 2 jumps away, the military still has a large presence on Linirea, as it acts as a barrier for Celestis and the other Alteran core worlds. The planet has several different invasion countermeasures, some of which are hidden under normal circumstances.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located in the outskirts of the largest city and built similarly to the city, with landing pads slightly below ground. In case of an attack, the pads can be covered and moved even lower if necessary. Since they are underground, the terminals consist of long, well decorated pathways with few windows, exclusively towards the landing pads and a handful of halls with open spaces or greenery.`
	spaceport `	A significant portion of the spaceport is built entirely different, with several vertical entry tunnels of varying proportions leading to an underground spaceport. This is the military spaceport and generally closed off to civilians.`

	spaceport `Noctillum’s spaceport is rather small and most of its buildings are partially made from wood.`

planet Noricum
	landscape land/beach11-harro
	description `One of the Alteran sector capitals, Noricum of the Borean Sector is one of the more developed worlds in Altera. It was originally settled as a mining world, and even now, food is harder to come by than in other regions of Altera. Over time, Noricum has developed a significant population and gained importance, especially since becoming the administrative capital of the inner Alteran worlds, the Borean Sector.`
	description `	Noricum is also home to a major Alteran naval base, mainly due to its location close to the galactic core and the Borean Sector, and bordering the presumably uninhabited Ember Waste. While the system itself does not actually count as a border system, most of the Borean Sector is within jump-drive range, allowing rapid reactions to any threats, especially around the sector border.`
	spaceport `The spaceport reflects the state of Noricum pretty well, several of the larger landing pads are reserved specifically for food-related freight ships. The military takes up another large portion of the spaceport, though mainly with transport vessels and smaller warships. The spaceport seems fairly well guarded, not from actual employed security, but simply because of the amount of military personnel present at all times, sitting around the spaceport.`

planet "Orbis Alteran"
	attributes "altera quarg" quarg station
	landscape land/station19
	description `This is a complete Quarg ringworld, the product of millennia of construction effort which has consumed every other stellar object in this system in order to provide the raw materials. The inner edge of the ring is filled with solar panels, hydroponic gardens, living quarters, and sunlit common spaces. The outer edge contains hangars and docks for ships, and storage facilities for cargo.`
	description `	Massive station-keeping thrusters on the ring's exterior keep its orbit from becoming unstable.`
	spaceport `If this section of the ring is any indication, there must be trillions of Quarg here. Since the construction work on the ring has long since ended, many of them seem to spend their time with creative or scientific endeavors instead. The spaceport is decorated with artwork of every imaginable kind: sculptures, mobiles, paintings, music, and even one hallway that cycles through various artificial odors, some of them intensely unpleasant to your human senses.`

planet Orilla
	landscape land/myrabella3
	description `Orbiting Othala is the moon of Orilla, a settled world lacking an atmosphere. The population is very low and spread around the planet in several dome complexes. Most of the goods here are imported, with a small part of the demand for food being covered by local agricultural domes. The moon was settled for mining the mineral rich ground and even now, several millennia later this is still the case.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Orilla is very small and split in two separate parts, a domed and an open section. Small ships can use the domed section with an airlock system through which the ship is transported after landing. For larger vessels, this kind of system was simply not feasible, so they have to land in the open section, where a pressurized bridge is connected to the ship.`

planet Othala
	landscape land/myrabella3
	description `Othala is one of two settled worlds in the Ida system and located just 1 jump away from Celestis. It's best described as a tech world, with an industry trimmed towards innovating and manufacturing outfits for spaceships, planetary transport systems, mining equipment, or even space stations.`
	description `	The landscape on Othala is particularly hospitable, so most of the population is located in one of 5 cities on the same part of the planet. Outside of these cities the terrain is quite rocky, and the temperature varies significantly depending on time and weather. A long time ago, there was an attempt to terraform Othala, but it ended in failure due to the bombings during the last war. The cities are located in partially terraformed sections with artificial weather.`
	spaceport `As with any world with manufacturing, the spaceport sees a lot of freight traffic, in particular raw materials from the orbiting moon of Orilla. While the spaceport was not initially built in the city center, the industry's preference for spaceport proximity has resulted in the port being surrounded by industrial complexes.`
	spaceport `	After the war, the spaceport was repaired and expanded in several, identifiable steps, with the military section in particular having grown significantly, as the Ida system was among those that fell to the enemy, leaving the Inner Core open to attacks.`

planet Raetorum
	landscape land/mountain5
	description `Raetorum was founded using an Alteran city-ship which can still be identified by its central spire, towering over most buildings in its surroundings. The ship itself is well integrated into the city and as such no longer functional. Compared to other worlds in the Alteran Core, Raetorum is less densely populated and less populated in general. Most of the populace lives in cities concentrated on one continent, in relative proximity to the spaceport.`
	description `	As there was no need for intra-planetary defenses, most of the cities were set up in large plains, the ideal building locations. The areas surrounding the cites are used for food production.`
	spaceport `While the spaceport used to be located on one of the city-ship's arms, this is no longer the case. Instead, a new, high-capacity spaceport was built in the outskirts of the planetary capital. The current spaceport is a simple but pretty structure, organized like a snowflake, with the larger vessels landing far away from the center.`

planet "Stacia Centoria"
	landscape land/station35
	description `At the center of the Borean sector lies the Troyca system, the asteroid activity has made all possible candidates uninhabitable. With the resources on both the planets and the surrounding asteroids, it would have been quite wasteful to not setup a mining base. Towards that end the responsible parties opted for a space station rather than a planetary base. At the center of the system’s activity lies Stacia Centoria, a well built and high capacity mining station, refueling, repairing and processing almost all mining vessels in the Troyca system.`
	spaceport `Were it not for the stations defensive systems, the approach to Stacia Centoria would be by far the most dangerous in Alteran space. As it would be unfeasible to build a station capable of housing heavy freighters, the spaceport is split in two, with several docks on the outside and a handful of hangars for smaller vessels. The spaceport is very busy, with most of the activity coming from the mining vessels processed here.`

planet Turicum
	landscape land/valley12-harro
	description `Turicum, probably the least expensive of the Alteran Paradise Worlds, is full of rolling green hills and rocky mountains, resulting in more weather variation than on Atlantis and Halcyon, including some less pleasant snow storms. As a result, the tourism industry is very large, both during summer and winter, giving Turicum a more casual economy. Several large cities are visible from space which have a large parks and green zones placed in their interior, reducing the population density.`
	description `	While some material industry is present here, Turicum is a net importer of almost everything. Additionally, a significant portion of the planet is still in its natural state and will stay this way due to the environmental protection laws in place.`
	spaceport `On the other side of a hill from one of the cities, connected by a maglev line, lies the only public spaceport on this world. It’s made up of several landing areas and terminals for spaceships. Due to the tourism on this world, a lot of the traffic is made up of transport vessels. As such, a large section of the spaceport is trimmed towards and reserved almost exclusively for passenger transports. The military presence on Turicum on the other hand is barely large enough to justify a military section at the spaceport.`

planet Vanir
	landscape land/snow2
	description `The permafrost world of Vanir is just outside of the Alteran Inner Core and can be reached from Celestis with just 2 jumps. It hasn't seen an ice-free day in the last millennium and is nearly inhospitable as a result. In its past, Vanir used to be abundant with life, though for an unknown reason, the planet started cooling, becoming a frozen wasteland, with no end in sight, even at this point in time.`
	description `	As a result of the ice age, most of the cities have been abandoned over the course of the last few millennia, except for a few smaller cities, which have had a dome built over them, to allow greenery on this white planet. They house researchers working in the laboratories, which benefit from the low legal restrictions of this world. Additionally, Draconium deposits have been found on Vanir, resulting in several mines spread over the planet. The Alteran Military conducts invasion training operations on Vanir as well.`
	spaceport `Compared to the other Alteran spaceports, this one is smaller and less open. Due to the planet's hostile nature, there are several gated horizontal entrances to some kind of underground spaceport, protecting the ships from the storms raging outside. This has however resulted and a less efficient design, only capable of properly handling small ships, as larger vessels don't fit through the gates. Consequently, only few large ships can be seen in the sky, and they only land near the military facilities, keeping their power and shields on for protection.`

planet Wyvernhaven
	landscape land/nasa1
	description `Wyvernhaven is one of the Alteran Central Worlds and generally regarded as the second most important planet, due to it being the seat of the United Alteran navy. This is immediately noticeable while landing as well, as most of the ships you can observe are flying under military colors and even the majority of civilian grade ships are flying for the Navy.`
	description `	While the military has a strong presence here, Wyvernhaven is also one of the more populous Alteran worlds, with a population lower than that of Celestis, but still relatively high, as it was settled millennia ago. Since a large part of the economy and populace are based around the military, Wyvernhaven can barely be called a civilian world.`
	spaceport `The civilian section of the spaceport is by no means small, mostly because of the amount of freighters coming in for the shipyards. As a result, the landing pads are very large and the surrounding infrastructure was designed to support highly efficient loading and transportation.`
	spaceport `	The military section, however, is even larger than the civilian section, built to handle a massive fleet. A large portion of the Alteran fleet is generally stationed here, both offensive and defensive fleet compositions can be seen on the ground and above, in the sky. The Alteran Military Shipyards produce a considerable percentage of their ships here, the medium and heavy warships in particular have a large presence in the hangar.`
