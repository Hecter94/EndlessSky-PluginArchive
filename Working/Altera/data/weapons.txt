	description "They are tiny, they glow, and are insane weapons. The Alteran Drone Weapons. They are like rockets but better. They go right through the shields. It only takes a bunch of them to take out a capital ship, they are deadly. They might not seem deadly alone, fighting against a ship armed with one of these would be a mistake"

	description "The Alterans developed a weapon of massive caliber, specifically for their satellite defence system, the Titan Defensive System (TDS). The damage is insane, even the  Alteran Drone Weapons can't be compared to this. It forms plasma into a beam that burns through any kind of shielding in no time and without shields, they just rip apart nearly any ship before you even notice. However, the massive amounts of energy required make them practically useless without a ZPM, dual wielding one of these is out of the question."
