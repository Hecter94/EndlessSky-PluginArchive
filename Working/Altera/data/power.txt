outfit "ASGX Solar Collector"
	category "Power"
	cost 265000
	thumbnail "outfit/alteran solar"
	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"solar collection" 2.1
	"solar heat" 1.7
	"ramscoop" 6
	"gun ports" -1
	description "This odd outfit is capable of harvesting power and fuel simultaneously from nearby stars. While the ASGX Solar Collector is highly efficient, it comes with the major drawback of using a gun port. The original designers decided that for supply and recon vessels, where guns aren't particularly important, the efficiency improvements were worth the gun port."

# Batteries

outfit "AAUX-I Accumulation Unit"
	category "Power"
	cost 124000
	thumbnail "outfit/small alteran battery"
	"mass" 6
	"outfit space" -6
	"energy capacity" 6300
	"cooling inefficiency" 0.5
	description "the AAUX-I is standard on most Alteran vessels to even out peak power, supplementing solar collectors or other generators."
	description "The Alteran Accumulation Units suffer from cooling inefficiency, a major drawback, that quincidentally works well in combination with Draconic Reactors."

outfit "AAUX-II Accumulation Unit"
	category "Power"
	cost 470500
	thumbnail "outfit/medium alteran battery"
	"mass" 20
	"outfit space" -20
	"energy capacity" 25200
	"cooling inefficiency" 1.5
	description "Far less common than the AAUX-I, these batteries are commonly used by warships with high power requirements."

# Generators

outfit "ABGX Backup Generator"
	category "Power"
	cost 1337000

	"mass" 34
	"outfit space" -34
	"energy generation" 6.7
	"heat generation" 7.3
	description "The ABGX Backup Generator was initially used as its name suggests, but has since been replaced by integrated backup storage/generator systems in the Draconic Reactors. Instead, this generator model sees a lot of use in smaller craft a Draconic Reactor wouldn't make sense."

# Draconic Reactors

outfit "ADRX-I Draconic Reactor"
	category "Power"
	cost 7448000
	thumbnail "outfit/small draconic reactor"
	"mass" 76
	"outfit space" -58
	"energy generation" 9.2
	"energy capacity" 5850
	"heat generation" 38.6
	"active cooling" 2.5
	"cooling energy" -10
	description "Due to their efficiency, Draconic Reactors are present on most Alteran ships. With the ADRX-I being the smallest standard reactor and although it is relatively small, it is still very powerful and hot."
	description "Draconic Reactor outputs and efficiency increase with core temperature, doubling the energy generation near max heat. A Battery is built-in to account for short but strong power bursts."

outfit "ADRX-II Draconic Reactor"
	category "Power"
	cost 21600000
	thumbnail "outfit/medium draconic reactor"
	"mass" 152
	"outfit space" -116
	"energy generation" 19.1
	"energy capacity" 11700
	"heat generation" 84.8
	"active cooling" 5.25
	"cooling energy" -21
	description "The ADRX-II is installed whenever the smaller ADRX-I's power supply is insufficient and is considerably larger and more powerful. While it is more space efficient, it does run less efficiently, producing more heat in the process."
	description "Draconic Reactor outputs and efficiency increase with core temperature, doubling the energy generation near max heat. A Battery is built-in to account for short but strong power bursts."

outfit "ADRX-III Draconic Reactor"
	category "Power"

	"energy capacity" 17500
	"heat generation" 148.4
	"active cooling" 8.4
	"cooling energy" -33.6
	description "Used only by Alteran capital ships, the ADRX-III is the most powerful Draconic Reactor. Most ships would never need this much power and would most certainly be unable to fit one of these properly. Sale of the ADRX-III is heavily restricted."

	"energy generation" -3.2
	"energy capacity" 1000000
	"heat generation" 9.7
	"ZPM capacity" -1
	description "The Zero Point Module (ZPM) extracts vacuum energy from an artificial region of subspace-time until it reaches maximum entropy. This allows it to generate tremendous amounts of energy, however, its energy source is finite and when maximum entropy is reached, the subspace-time region collapses and only the ZPM shell is left."

outfit "AMCX-I Module Converter"
	category "Power"
	cost 20800000
	thumbnail "outfit/zpm converter"
	"mass" 50
	"outfit space" -50
	"ZPM capacity" 1
	description "Since only the larger Alteran ships are capable of equipping a ZPM, they built a large device with a single ZPM slot for the rare occasion where a ZPM may be needed."
