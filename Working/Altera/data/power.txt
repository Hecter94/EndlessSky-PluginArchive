	description "The ABGX Backup Generator was initially used as its name suggests, but has since then been replaced by integrated backup storage/generator systems in the Draconic Reactors. As such, this generator model is seeing a lot of use in smaller craft that don't need anything as large as a Draconic Reactor."

	description "The Alpha Core is a small Alteran power source used for small ships like the Jumper. Its energy production is comparable to that of the NT-200 generator, however, it's a lot more efficient. It produces very stable energy through Draconium (from the Alteran word for Dragon), a small naturally hot metal found solely on Draconis in the Pegasus systems."

	description "The third and last of the Draconic Reactors, the Gamma Core generates energy at the maximum efficiency, anything bigger is increasingly unstable and can blow up whole fleets. When not using a ZPM, the Azrael-Class and the Aurora-Class use this Generator."

	"ZPM capacity" -1
	description "The Zero Point Module (ZPM) extracts vacuum energy from an artificial region of subspace-time until it reaches maximum entropy. This allows it to generate tremendous amounts of energy, however, its energy source is finite and when maximum entropy is reached, the subspace-time region collapses and only the ZPM shell is left."
	description "A secondary Generator is present to start up the ZPM and to supply energy when the ZPM is depleted. It can be seen as an energy storage device."

	description "Since only Alteran ships are designed to be capable of using a ZPM, together with a few humans they considered worthy, they built a converter to hold a ZPM and connect it to a standard non-Alteran ship."
