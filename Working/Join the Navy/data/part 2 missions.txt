	planet Geminus
		description `Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in a twilight haze of ash and fog.`
		description `	The shattered remnants of the old Navy Yard are still left abandoned and slowly rusting away in the planet's caustic atmosphere, but the Republic has now built a new shipyard to replace the one destroyed in the bombing, and once again Geminus has become a central hub of technology and industry.`
		spaceport `Like everything else on Geminus, the spaceport is not terribly pretty, but is functional and efficient. Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled.`
		spaceport `	The hub of the spaceport is a food court with a ring of shops in the center and seating on the outside, where you can look out of plate glass windows at the lava fields and caldera outside. By night, you can see the volcanic glow all around the horizon.`

#### I should note that this is just the edited dialogue from Michael Zahniser's "navy Pug 2B" mission from the reconciliation branch. (because this was too hard for me to write and supposed to have the exact same outcome)
			`As you are coming in for a landing you announce yourself to the spaceport authorities as diplomatic representatives of the Republic. The moment you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you to their headquarters, to the incredibly fancy corner office of Alastair Korban, the CEO of the entire Syndicate Corporation. "I'm very glad you've come," says Alastair. "It seems unlikely that we can defeat this attack unless we work together."`
			`	"Wait," John says, "you're saying this whole thing is not the Syndicate's doing?"`
			`	Alastair seems taken aback. "Of course not. Seal off valuable trade routes? Why would we do that?"`
			choice
				`	"We thought you were walling yourselves off to escape prosecution for your acts of terrorism."`
				`	"If it isn't you, then who is it?"`
					goto who
			
			`	Alastair says, "That terrorism was the action of a certain extremist faction that we have since purged from our ranks, and we were in the process of hunting down the perpetrators."`
			choice
				`	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
				`	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
					goto who
			
			`	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
					goto who
			label who
			`	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
			`	"How do you know this?" asks John.`
			`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"Did it not occur to you that attacking the Korath might anger other alien species?"`
					goto anger
				`	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`
					goto convoluted
			
			label anger
			`	"That is unlikely. The equipment we stole from the Korath is most likely something they stole from someone else."`
				goto help
			
			label convoluted
			`	"Yes," he says, "it is a very convoluted mess. Which is why we need your help."`
				goto help
			
			label help
			`	"Assuming you're telling the truth," you say, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
			`	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
			choice
				`	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
					goto deal
				`	"Wait, you're saying that your fleet that was in orbit around Earth... was armed with nuclear weapons? Are you genocidal?"`
			
			`	Alastair seems like the kind of person who seldom admits he is wrong, but your question definitely flusters him. "Okay, okay, I admit, we've been making one bad decision after another ever since... well, since that first bad decision. It just got out of control. We thought the Navy was going to raid us and put us all behind bars. We thought we needed a deterrent. It was stupid. I admit it, okay? Now please, let's just move on. We need your capital ships, and you need our jump drives."`
			
			label deal
			`	"Hold on," John says, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`

You follow one of the Pug ships that is landing, and discover a large spaceport where a surprising number of human merchant ships are parked, in addition to the aliens.`
			`	Elsewhere they have mostly ignored you, but here your ship is quickly approached by a small group of the pale-skinned, delicate aliens. The Pug are oddly proportioned, with long arms and legs but short, barrel-shaped torsos and large heads, and although they only have two legs, their gait is vaguely insectoid. "You came from outside," one of them says. "You are not pledged to the Protectorate. Do you wish to make your vow of loyalty and peacefulness at this time?"`

			choice
				`	"What do you want from us in return?"`
				`	"What are you planning to do with these systems you have occupied?"`
			`	"We have brought peace to this region," says the alien, "and we will continue to spread peace until violence has come to an end throughout human space. That is our only desire. All that we ask in return is a portion of the goods your worlds produce, to help offset the cost of watching over and protecting so many human worlds. And after some time, we will again allow human beings autonomous control of certain parts of your territory, when you show yourselves capable of living peacefully."`
			`	"By 'spreading peace,' do you mean occupying more systems?" asks John.`
			`	"We mean bringing an end to your war and your divisions," the alien says. "Those of your worlds and your people who have shown themselves unable to live peacefully, we must govern, to teach them peace. Any who attack us, we must destroy, because we are the bringers of peace, and whoever attacks us is not on the side of peace. And so we will send you back to your people now, to tell them that they have nothing to fear, and that they should await our peace and our protection."`
