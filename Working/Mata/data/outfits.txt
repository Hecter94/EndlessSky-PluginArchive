	description "The Plasma Blade's intended purpose is as a land-frame tool for mining and general industrial work, and it is so incredibly effective that lighter versions have been developed as short range weapons for land-frame combat. This one has instead been made bigger, heavily modified by the rebels for use as a weapon in space, with the original case expanded to provide space for extra hardware and a standard mount. Sacrificing its original precision as a tool, it uses a lot more energy to deliver unmatched firepower at a very short range. The systems that generate the blade take a very long time to warm up, so when in use, it needs to stay in idle mode, constantly consuming power, and with the power requirements way beyond the original specifications, it requires constant maintenance."

	description "The technology behind this weapon is incomprehensibly complex, even for ancient Mata standards. With a pulse of negative energy, it creates a linear rift in spacetime, generating extreme negative gravitational forces in its path that splits matter apart as if it wasn't there, going right through. While it is capable of piercing shields just as well, inside them, the interference from the matrix disrupts the beam and lowers the damage, so Relic recommends pairing it with their own Chronovortex weapons to weaken shields first."

	description "This advanced warp-lance model generates a much tighter linear rift which is capable of doing much more damage through shields, but it never caught on, and isn't found in outfitters anymore. It uses much more power, the lower damage of the tighter beam hardly justifies the extra piercing, and makes it much less useful when shields are down. Regardless, a few mercenaries still prefer this version, and it has plenty of scientific value."

	description "The most coveted of Mata weapons. Through unfathomable means, this weapon tangles the fabric of spacetime in such extreme ways that it forms closed time-like curves, along with chaotic gravitational forces and fascinating relativistic effects that slows the target down. Solid matter bends and crumbles under the chaos, and shield matrices are forced to interact with themselves, with catastrophic results. As if fulfilling their own intended destiny, the projectiles are slightly drawn to their target as well. Relic advises that attempting to tinker with this weapon to create a time machine voids warranty, and often results in certain death."

It swallows anything that dares to come close to it, holding them in place and slowly shredding them with gravitational waves and radiation. Due do its nature, targets that are big and heavy are much more susceptible to damage from it, but the ship that fires it is also bound to the gravitational well, losing maneuverability."

This technology is the reason why missiles are obsolete in the Rift.

	description "Made to counter the fact that the warp cannon doesn't teleport at angles, the turret version really makes missiles obsolete. The smaller turret mounted on a fast-swiveling base makes it virtually impossible to avoid, but the teleportation is still likely to miss at longer ranges. To save mass and make sure the turret is able to track any fast-moving target, this version doesn't impart kinetic energy onto the shells before teleporting them, instead relying only on their raw explosive power."

Large, pure samples are expensive, rare, and also unsafe, as any damage to them while charged could result in an explosion comparable to a nuclear bomb, and thus requires a very complex containment system. To solve all of these problems, Slipstream innovates using tiny pure fragments, carefully extracted from impure crystals, arranged in a polycrystalline lattice. Any damage to the cell would only affect individual crystals without causing a chain reaction, and it is still capable of holding as much energy as fissible material."

	description "The Afterlife System is the technology that differentiates Void Frames from normal spaceships, as well as other kinds of Frames used on air, land, and sea. This special pod is connected to a multitude of sensors, a specialized helper AI, and has space for one person - which is the only crew a Frame needs to operate. The pilot, known as a Ghost in Mata terms, is neurally connected to the Frame, which essentially becomes the Ghost's new body. Extensive training is required to get used to seeing the world through the provided sensors and moving with thrusters instead of limbs, and the costs to fulfill the specialized operational needs of this system are very high. But in return, such a fundamental connection allows the Ghost to micromanage aspects of the ship that would be impossible even for an advanced AI, redirecting shields to absorb incoming hits, and effortlessly maneuvering to take hits to well armored or non essential spots when dodging isn't possible. The adaptability that this system provides ensures that the Frame can never be rendered helpless."
	description "Void-Frames are built around the Afterlife System. They cannot function without it, and it cannot be installed on conventional spaceships without extensive modification."

	description "The inclusion of a second pod allows for two individuals to simultaneously operate a frame, which is great for training new Ghosts faster, but having two distinct, conflicting minds interacting with each other is a huge detriment to performance. While in theory, two well aligned minds could increase performance even further, the tolerance is incredibly tiny, and no such pairings have ever been found. Thus, every other Frame is equipped with a single pod."

	description "This is the smallest of the Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters, intended for slipstream's fighters. Unlike other engines that get more efficient with a larger size, the high power afterburner mode actually works better when small. As a result, this engine is able to run on high power continuously, with only the fuel provided by the onboard ramscoop, as long as there is enough energy to feed it."

	description "This is the medium size of the Magnetoplasmadynamic Thrusters, also known as MPDs. Developed by Slipstream, these engines save space by generating high energy plasma in a centralized location, and piping them to maneuvering units as needed. Usually they aren't very fast, but they come with an integrated afterburner mode, which is highly efficient. They are notorious for extremely high maneuverability, and when the afterburner mode is on, they go even faster than Relic's Warp Drives."

	description "These are the largest Magnetoplasma Thrusters in production, designed for the heaviest of Slipstream's ships. It boasts incredible maneuverability, but at a massive cost for equally powerful acceleration. The afterburners are inefficient due to the size, making it useful only in short bursts to close in or escape."

	description "This is the smallest of the warp drives, and the least efficient of them, but the difference is small. Its jumping capabilities are slightly worse than that of a standard hyperdrive. It is often installed to complement the other engine sizes, since Relic doesn't have as many size choices, or even paired with a larger MPD thruster just for its hyperspace and reversing capabilities."

	description "The warp drive works not by moving the ship around space, but by moving space itself around the ship. By isolating the vessel within its own bubble of spacetime, it resists slowing effects. It is not great at turning, but it accelerates quickly, both forwards and backwards. Uniquely, it is capable of functioning as a hyperdrive as well, each engine increasing the speed at which it is capable to jump, but it is a very power-hungry machine, demanding a constant energy supply to idle, and even more when moving."

	description "Although boarding combat is pretty much impossible with Frames, simple weapons are still popular for self defense on the ground. The Slipstream Plasma Pistol is marketed more as a survival tool than a weapon. It features many firing modes, from the standard plasma shots to charged explosive shots, or a short ranged stream of plasma for starting fires and scaring large predators. In a pinch, the Nihilite battery powering it can even serve as a powerful improvised explosive."
