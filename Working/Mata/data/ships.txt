	description "This is the dream Frame of every fighting Ghost in the rift. Featuring the best and most advanced technology available in Mata space, the Wyvern was designed specifically for one thing, and one thing only. Combat, both in and out of an atmosphere. The tiny cargo hold is suitable only for delivering small, high risk packages, or to further increase the outfitting space it has, as many Ghosts tend to do. It comes fully outfitted with Relic's finest equipment, making it an unstoppable war machine, easily considered the most dangerous Frame money can buy."

	description "Created as a response to Slipstream's Eldritch project, The Empyrean is skillfully crafted by an elite team of shipwrights, artisans, and engineers, utilizing the most exquisite materials. It was designed in the likeness of an ancient Mata Goddess, and it is in fact, the closest you can get to impersonating a deity, with power, speed and elegance. Only a handful of them exist, and only the most trusted of individuals can even hope to order one for themselves. Each Empyrean built comes with an unique Gravity Projector gun and an improved singularity core to feed its enormous energy requirements."

	description "The Cetus is a Void frame optimized for courier jobs, but also very popular with explorers and Nihilite hunters. It has a very spacious cargo bay, and is incredibly durable, which is good, considering how slow it is. Despite not producing any fighters or shuttles, Relic still included docking bays on it, which is greatly appreciated for Ghosts who want to widen job opportunities and improve the capabilities of the Cetus."

	description "The name is an allusion to the popularity of this void frame among novice ghosts. It is a multirole, with decent armament and cargo capacity while also being exceptionally durable and lightweight. An unique Warp Dampener is built into the design, which gives it unmatched speed and allows it to enter hyperspace at greater speeds, ensuring it can always escape any dangerous situation. All these characteristics, as well as the relatively cheap price for a Relic frame, make it immensely popular among nihilite hunters, smugglers, and explorers"

	description "The result of an unlikely cooperation between Slipstream and Relic, the Nugget is an unique trainer void-frame. Training a Ghost used to take years before the advent of the Dual Afterlife system. With it, new Ghosts can link with more experienced Ghosts, developing the required neural pathways in a matter of days to weeks."

	description "Imps are latest in a long line of fighter drones developed by Slipstream, with a perfect balance between survivability, speed, and firepower in its stock configuration. Of the few weaknesses it has, the most obvious one is a reliance on ammunition for its Microfusion Cannon, but the firepower is well worth it."

	description "The Eldritch is an experimental Void-Frame created by Slipstream with a focus on maximum durability. It is a supercarrier design, able to carry 24 Imps on external bays, which in turn can deliver excessive firepower like nothing else in the rift, but the Eldritch itself is very slow. This veritable mighty glacier takes an unprecedented amount of resources to build, but the assembly process is fairly straightforward, leading to relatively easy availability for anyone with high enough standing with Slipstream and very heavy pockets."
