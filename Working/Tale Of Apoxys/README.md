Turn endless sky into an RPG with a ship that grows with you, crafting, and plenty of side-goodies to play with

Currently the mod is separated into two branches, pending a bugfix. The main branch is playable with no issues on continuous. The carrier pre-alpha, on the other hand, requires a bugfix PR (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7030) to be fully enjoyed, and is also unfinished.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy!
