			`"Oh, captain," Maribelle begins, "May I occupy your time for a moment?" She asks. You agree, and take a seat in front of her console.

			`"Well, we keep getting larger, but it seems like most guns only get so big," Maribelle explains, "By combining and upgrading our existing weapons, we can make better usage of our ship's space."`

			`"That's the spirit, captain! I'd like to return to New Boston, where we first met. There used to be a weapon foundry somewhere near the warehouse where you found me," Maribelle states, "No rush, of course, but I'd like to do it eventually. It would probably be best to bring some intersting guns with us for materials; building from scratch would take far too long."`
				accept
				
			label convinced
			`"I understand your hesitation, captain; but I promise, I won't take on anything I think would be dangerous," Maribelle reassures, "I believe there was an old weapon forge on New Boston, where we first met. When we're able, I'd like to go there, ideally with some materials. If we have any interesting alien guns in storage, now's the time to bring them out!"`

			`"It will be somewhere around here..." Maribelle says softly, as you hand off the flight controls to Maribelle so she can find what she's looking for. She takes a while to scan the planet, running scanners at higher power than you think she should. She then bursts into joyous cheering as the scanner finally picks up a certain abandoned complex, and she quickly pilots the ship towards the complex.`
			`	"Found it?" You ask.`
			`"Yup!" Maribelle says, "It'll just be a tricky landing..." She pulls into an old, broken docking bay next to the facility, which seems to be specifically designed to take cargo from ships through one input and output modified cargo from one output. You take note of the design. "This is it?" You ask. Maribelle nods affirmatively, "Yup! I know it looks inconspicuous, but inside is equipment necessary to disassemble and reassemble just about any kind of ship equipment. Next time we land, I'll ask you to plug me into the factory's mainframe, and then we can build things!" Maribelle explains.`
