	description "This is three triple plasma cores roughly interwoven with a set of three large heat shunts, able to supply a ton of power but taking far more than a ton of space. The advantage of arranging the components in this way, though, is that that the cooling systems can directly offset the reactors' heat, without being affected by cooling inefficiencies or the like."

	description `This systems core has had it rough, but it seems to still be mostly stable, despite the factory's aggressive modifications. The battery has been severely shrunk, and the entire system now uses idle power and generates idle heat; but its space efficiency has over doubled, and its total power increased even further.`
