	description "The Apoxys is a large warship of unknown origin, quite weak by most standards, but with the curious ability to grow and evolve as it experiences the galaxy. The ship is helmed not only by a human crew, but a powerful AI, known only as Maribelle; it's believed that, at one point, the Apoxys was a completely autonomous war machine, but for one reason or another, it has since been turned into a human-crewed vessel."

	description "This core houses the AI Maribelle, the persona of the Apoxys. Through her own intelligence and learning ability, the Apoxys can grow and evolve as it explores more and more of the galaxy. Naturally, it cannot be removed from the ship."
