	description "WIP HAS NO IMAGE"
	description "Faulcon Delacy built this ship as a turret-focused, multipurpose warship. Its hull is made out of an experimental composite, giving it immense strength and relatively low mass. It also has an experimental docking bay, capable of housing an interceptor-class ship."
	description "The Anaconda is difficult to maneuver, and all of its features come at a steep cost. Despite this, it remains one of the most capable multirole ships in known space."

	description "The Sidewinder has paper-thin defenses, lacks space for passenger or cargo transport, and is overall a terrible ship. However, it has one advantage over its competition. It is dirt cheap. This makes it a decent little runabout for anyone looking to explore the galaxy on a budget."
	description "	Experienced captains may recommend using the Sidewinder to mine asteroids, or stripping the guns and fitting some sort of expansion using the spare outfit space. More commonly, though, they recommend not buying a Sidewinder."
