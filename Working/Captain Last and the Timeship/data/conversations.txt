conversation "intro"
	`	The year is 3895 and humanity is on the brink of extinction.  A race of superhumans like the Alphas have discovered how to reproduce and evolve at a rapid rate.  Their weapons have pushed humanity towards oblivion, but there is still a small glimmer of hope.`
	`	In a secret base deep under the ocean of the planet "New Home" scientists have stumbled upon a way to move not only space but also time around a vessel.  They have finished building the prototype which is docked at the space-station in orbit.  Their hope is that a daring crew can take the ship back to a time before the birth of the Thetas and stop them from ever being created.`
	`	You are scheduled to take command of the prototype ship at 20:00 hours tomorrow.  You find yourself walking towards the mess when alarms start to sound all over the station.  It can only mean that the Thetas have found "New Home".`
	`	Your first officer Lt. Bryant catches up with you.  He stops for a moment to catch his breath before saying hurriedly "Hey, we're under attack!  We need to get you and the time-ship out of here before we all get blown up!"`
