### additional command buttons <br>
<br>
Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 
<ul>
<li>full stop</li>
<li>board ship</li>
<li>land on planet</li>
<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>
<li>fleet: hold position</li>
<li>fleet: gather around me</li>
<li>fleet: attack my target</li>
<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>
<li>view player info</li>
<li>fast forward</li>
</ul>
and
<ul>
<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>
<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>
</ul>
<br>

<br>
Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>
<br>
Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>
- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>
- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>
<br>
This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>
