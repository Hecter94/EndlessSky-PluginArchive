		description "The Lionheart Corvette served as a testbed for experimental ultra-light materials pioneered by the engineers of the Deep. Following its success, these materials have matured into use for new systems. One of the more mundane, yet useful of these uses is adding light-yet-sturdy blisters to a ship's exterior which can be used to house extra weapons, coolant systems, reactors, or even bunkrooms.
		description "	In order to avoid unbalancing a vessel's center of mass - which would play havoc with maneuvering - each blister is sculpted onto the vessel's hull by a team of experts. This does, of course, make the cost somewhat prohibitive for most captains."

		description "For a hefty fee Tarazed engineers will rip out your entire propulsion infrastructure, tune-up your engines, and reinforce thrust-bearing components of the ship's superstructure.
		description "	Ships are often built with cost-efficiency in mind, but when the priority is performance at-all-costs most components can be replaced with higher-performing versions, miniaturized, or otherwise tuned-up by a specialist. The result is that the same system is now capable of supporting an extra, or larger engine than it could before."

		description "	Though the process is expensive, Barmy Edward himself will oversee a refit and overhaul of your ship's offensive infrastructure. Power feeds are ripped out and replaced with more expensive but higher-performing models, bulky components are replaced with lighter more advanced materials, and then Barmy rearranges everything to - improbably - all fit together again. The result is a bit more space to pack more potent weapons systems. It's pricey, but do you really value your credits more than your life?"

		description "Betelgeuse Shipyards is a venerable institution, hailing back from before shield technology had advanced to its current, reliable state. Back then, sometimes the only thing standing between a ship's crew and the void - or belligerent pirates - was a few inches of ablative plating and reinforced bulkhead. Though expensive, Betelgeuse Shipyards' custom up-armoring services have saved many a captain over the centuries, and continues to be a favorite among those who value their life more than saving money."

		description	"Hai up-armoring techniques were born out of necessity during the centuries-long conflict between the Hai and their Unfettered brethren. With the brutal effect that an Ion Cannon barrage can have on shields and the electrical systems which support them, Hai captains have learned the hard way that the only defense they can truly rely on is their ship's hull."
		description "Composed of several layers of advanced ablative laminates, self-sealing anti-warhead compartments, and topped off with a simple but effective steel shell, the armor pioneered on Cloudfire is sturdy, heavy, and expensive. Considering a full workup can cost as much as a new ship, it's generally only used to protect critical components and crew compartments."

		description "Mass-produced ships are rarely - if ever - created with optimized electrical systems. Owing to the legendarily shoddy wiring found in Syndicate-produced vessels, Megaparsec has decided to enter the market for aftermarket electrical solutions. The service, far from being only attractive to luxury-minded Syndicate CEOs, has ended up attracting the attention of merchant captains, pirate lords, bounty hunters and anyone looking to squeeze just a bit more power from their ship."
		description "For a sizable sum Megaparsec engineers will completely overhaul your ship's power infrastructure and install a custom electrical grid calibrated to the needs of your ship. The most noticeable result is more efficient shielding - but perhaps more importantly, your crew will be able to sleep better without the constant hum of cheap conduits over their bunks."

It's as popular among martially-inclined captains who value shrugging off missile impacts as it is among ultra-wealthy private ship owners who don't want their luxurious furnishings to be disturbed by atmospheric re-entry."

		description "While interference plating can be effective when simply mounted adjacent to the hull, those with secrets to hide and money to spend can instead have it integrated fully into their hull. This is generally accompanied by surface-level reshaping in order to better neutralize radar. Treating an entire ship can render its interior an enigma to observers and its exterior effectively invisible to radar-based missiles."
		description "The technical sophistication inherent in such an overhaul, as well as its questionable legality, leads to its scarcity; every pirate and smuggler out there would be packing a hull like this if they could."

Once clamped onto a target it can, in short order: cut a wide boarding breach, flush grenades of choice into the breach, and then facilitate rapid entry by marine teams. An expensive and rather niche modification for ships, it's generally only used by wealthy pirates and Naval special operations. Regardless of the owner, the poor saps on the receiving end are practically guaranteed a bad day."

The hodge-podge of alien electrical components before you seems unlikely to form any sort of harmonious system, but the technician assures you that with a bit of elbow grease they'll have your ship's electrical grid humming with new vitality.`
		description "Although your junction boxes now resemble an unholy casserole of jumpers and splicework, the integration of alien salvage has nonetheless done wonders for the performance of the ship's systems and shields. It's a testmanent to Remnant reverse-engineering that they got it to work together at all, much less better than before."

		description "The Remnant's vessels weren't always a harmonious fusion of the organic and synthetic. The first several generations of ships still used largely conventional hulls and electrical grids, onto which then-new organic technologies were fitted. Though this is no longer how things are done in Remnant shipyards, the technique to retrofit purely mechanical vessels with all the systems necessary to maintain organic-hybrid systems remains known to archivists and specialists. There hasn't been need to undertake such a conversion in centuries, but Remnant technicians stand willing to assist you in converting your ship - provided you're willing to cover the quite substantial costs of the endeavor."
		description "This procecure will endow your vessel with the infrastructure needed to properly interface with Remnant organic technology, enabling further modifications. It does, however, entail a fundamental reworking of your ship's hull plating and internal systems - this will significantly reduce the ability of your ship to accept other modifications."

On occasion a ship will become damaged - some might say wounded - and replacement of the gills becomes necessary. As this isn't a terribly common procedure, only the capital world keeps extra gills in reserve."
		description "Though the mounting procedure most certainly wasn't designed with non-Remnant vessels in mind, the people of the Ember Wastes are nonetheless experts at reverse-engineering and creating syntheses of their technology and that of outsiders. The process is experimental but, given sufficient resources, a team of Remnant Engineers will integrate a set of prosthetic gills onto your ship."

Although these sensor systems were most certainly not designed for use on non-Remnant ships, retrofitting them onto your ship has proven to be a task up to the specialists of Aventine."
		description "Your ship's console now sports a thick sheath of semiorganic nerve-cables which, web-like, link together the far reaches of the hull into a single sensor network. Nestled next to power conduits lie nutrient feeds necessary to keep the new sensors alive; press your ear against them and you can hear the subtle, heart-like pulsing of the chemical broth within."
