	description "The Korunak Robotics Defense Drone series is almost as old as space exploration itself. The first models of this drone were used as surveillance cameras on Earth, and later as reconnaissance drones as the first colonies were established. They were repurposed as expendable freighter defense vessels during the Alpha wars, and the main design hasn't changed much since. Since it no longer bears any trademark value, the latest model is made mostly out of sparingly used aluminium and iron, which gives it poor hull integrity for the sake of affordability and agility."

	description "Once the Navy began building cruisers, demand for a civilian ship that can carry drones quickly became apparent. The Syndicate quickly answered this newly arisen interest in drones with a Modified Freighter: aside from having stronger hull and more weapon space than the standard model, it can also carry a pair of drones, which the captain can choose to sacrifice in order to give the fleet more time to escape the pirates."

	description "The Nock was released on market shortly after the Barb, although its development started almost a decade beforehand. It is easy to assume that the Nock was developed by the same team, since neither are particularly pretty, and appear pretty cramped by design. Despite the fact that it still requires to be remotely controlled by its carrier, the on-board AI has been developed to the point where it can sustain a shield matrix. This lets its carriers recharge it enough to be deployed again, making it reusable in prolonged battles."
