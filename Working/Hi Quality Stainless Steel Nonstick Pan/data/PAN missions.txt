Most of its parts are locked out or there is simply no physical way of acessing them. It almost seems like it was designed in different laws of physics.`

			`The spaceport's desktop screen shows something different this time: logs of events dated so far back they could also be older than this universe. This is either an error, or there's way more to it...`

			`Maybe it's a chance to restore the shipyards?`
