	description "The Tundra-Class Shield Generator is the smallest Kaltheim shield system. Designed to absorb energy from the projectiles which it deflects, this allows smaller Kaltheim ships to operate only on relatively small generators. The dissipation effects used by Kaltheim shields also allow them to cool their ships when being fired on."

	description "As with chemical weapons, incendiary weaponry for use on organic beings in prohibited by interstellar law. Incendiary grenades are considered just as illegal as nerve gas, but back a much bigger punch when used offensively. Although, do to their nature they actually harm you when used defensively. It turns out that burning your own ship from the inside is never a good idea."

	description "A plasma rifle is the direct upgrade to a laser rifle, providing both more offensive and defensive power to your crew. Instead of firing a beam of high-powered light, a plasma rifle fires a small burst of plasma. This burst, although traveling at slower speeds, has much more stopping power compared to that of a laser and without the proper protective material can leave severe burns on the target."

	description "Rail Rifles see a return to the days of old when ballistic weaponry was the main form of combat. Smaller versions of the same Particle Cannons that are used on ships, they fire a high-speed kinetic round that is able to punch through even the toughest of protective materials. The one drawback of Rail Rifles is that they require much more precision to be useful, and therefore are not as useful as a defensive weapon when you are being rushed by enemies."

	description "Although considered illegal by almost every government for hundred of years, slavery is still very common on pirate and anarchist planets. A slave can replace a crew member in everything but close combat, in order to avoid giving them a chance to escape. One problem with slaves is the risk of them rebelling and taking over the ship, which can be mitigated by keeping enough standard crew to stop any insurrection with force."

	description "This interference emitter has similar capabilities to the interference plating, utilising outfit space more efficiently at the cost of a constant energy consumption. One of these is enough to halve the chance of a successful scan."

Often the preferred choice of smugglers, perfect for passing through high security sectors with illegal cargo."
