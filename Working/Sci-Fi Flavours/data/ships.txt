	description "An ancient warship that last saw active service as a mobile fighter platform for the Imperium of Mankind's main battle fleet in the first human Hyperspace Wars. At this point in human history, shields had not yet been invented, so this battleship relied on thick ablative Nano-Mesh™ armor plating to survive.  Modern iterations of this ship include a small shield generator.  Designed to remain in the back lines and influence the course of a battle through fighter superiority, the Imperial Carrier sports less armor and fewer weapons than its battleship bretheren."

It came back in use as a pirate freighter after the discovery that its radiological shields and internal structure were very efficient at hiding its cargo, interfering with incoming scans enough to block almost all of them."
