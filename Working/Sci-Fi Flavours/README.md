# Sci-Fi-Flavours
An Endless Sky plugin.

This is version 1.0 of a Plugin that's intended to gently eventually incorporate all of my favourite science fiction content into Endless Sky.
It's a work in progress but since I am just about to start my first full playthrough of version 1.0 I thought I would share it with the Endless Sky community.

On my first playthrough I will be building a list of balance fixes and making notes on better mission/storyline integration.
If you have feedback I'd love to hear it, especially if you have ideas for balance and or ship variants. So send me your best ship + outfits combinations!

This Plugin contains:
  - About 100 new ships  
  - About 100 new outfits/weapons
  - No changes to storyline missions
  - More starter ships and increased start money (1 million)

To do list:
  - Hi Res sprites/images
  - Integration with campaign
  - New missions to gradually introduce plugin content
  - Learn how to create new sprites with blender :)
 
# Acknowledgments

I have been playing with, mixing, remixing, and modifying the content and assets from all of the following excellent plugins. I have used them as a guide and in some cases I've taken my favourite content and reproduced it in the Sci-Fi Flavours mod with only small tweaks to balance.

# Installation

(From the Endless Sky Wiki)
https://endless-sky.fandom.com/wiki/Mods

Installing mods is simple: place the folder containing the mod files in a folder labeled "plugins" in one of the following locations, depending on your operating system.
Linux

    /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
    ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

Windows

    plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
    C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

Mac OS X

    Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
    ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

The end result should be something like [file-path]\endless-sky\plugins\[plugin-name], which in turn will contain that specific mod's data, images, and sounds folders, and possibly readme and copyright info.
