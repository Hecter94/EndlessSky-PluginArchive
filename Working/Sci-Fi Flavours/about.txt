This is version 1.0 of a Plugin that's intended to gently eventually incorporate all of my favourite science fiction content into Endless Sky. It's a work in progress but since I am just about to start my first full playthrough of version 1.0 I thought I would share it with the Endless Sky community.

On my first playthrough I will be building a list of balance fixes and making notes on better mission/storyline integration. If you have feedback I'd love to hear it, especially if you have ideas for balance and or ship variants. So send me your best ship + outfits combinations! (linearperk@gmail.com)

This Plugin contains:

    About 100 new ships
    About 100 new outfits/weapons
    No changes to storyline missions
    More starter ships and increased start money (1 million)
