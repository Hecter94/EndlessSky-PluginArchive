			`On your descent you are provided with a fantastic view of the surrounding cityscape, everything has a sort of overwhelming industrial utilitarian appearance. Though offset by the distinct lack of pollution in the air, it is a sight to behold. Even more perplexing is the magnitude of the ringworld; you can't begin to fathom just how incredible the capabilities of this structure is. It could surely be home to entire species without any manner of difficulty.`
			`	Once you finally find a platform that can adequately fit your ship on it, you make quick work of the landing procedure and disembark. Eager to solve the looming mystery of what exactly this place is, you almost rush out without your emergency suit to protect you. Unlike making contact with the Quarg or Hai, you feel an ounce of angst weighing you down. Before you were surrounded by troves of other humans unphased by the relative situations, now you feel nothing but alone in this discovery.`
			`	Your suit indicates that the area has a suitable atmosphere and so you remove your helmet and sling it behind your head. The platform your ship rests on is devoid of any protruding structures or obvious paths, large grooves in the edges of the foundation disrupt the otherwise bare surface. You make it a small distance from your ship before you hear the sound of engines overhead; a pair of ships are descending the skyline in a spiral towards the platform before they pitch their ships to a vertical orientation and descend more delicately. Landing aside the platform lodged into the edges grooves, the newly in place vessels tower above you far into the sky even with the bulk of the vessels resting beneath the platform.`
			`	After a short wait in the absence of company, a group finally approaches you from behind the cover of one vessel. Remarkably human in appearance, you almost instinctively call out to them expecting them to understand you but decide to stay silent. One walks ahead of the rest and they wait further behind, the one who meets you face to face offers a spherical device and makes a sort of gesture for you to do something with it.`

				`	(Take the device.)`
					goto "take"
			`	"My name is <first> <last>, I come in peace." They show no sign that they understand you, it seems that nothing has been translated. They make the gesture yet again.`
			choice
				`	(Take the device.)`
			label "take"
			`	After taking the device, the group turns and begins to walk away from you, that was a quick meeting. You should try to find some place that could tell you about this place.`

		log Factions "Irm" `The Irm is an inward facing technocratic society, their entire civilization is undertaking the construction of a truly breathtaking megastructure. Although they seem to despise cooperating with other species presumably due to a lack of trust and no willingness to give them the chance to prove their trust, they have traded with the Hai before and continue to work towards a future where they can continue to benefit from their relationship, they mention having observed the rise and fall of the mighty Hai empire.`

			`When landing back on the massive ringworld, it is no less impressive as it was the first time around. Back to greet you are the same group of individuals from last time, "Greetings, your translation device seems to be fully functioning now. I understand you must have questions."`
			choice

			`	"That is pleasing to hear, yet unfortunate, casting off your own only leads to hardship. It is honorable to be part of something bigger than yourself, humbling most of all." He lectures, seeming somewhat unsettled by your response.`

			label "where"
			`	"This is home for us, the few stars that we control are ours. Some few who find our home have had similar vague questions, so you may well know just as they were let known, we do well with what we possess in difference to what surrounds us. You should know that mostly we don't encourage trading with those from outside, so we cannot offer to do more than to keep your ship fueled and allow material trade."`
			choice
				`	"What surrounds us? You've met the Hai?"`
					goto "hai"
				`	"I see. Well I'm just passing through."`
					goto "pass"
			label "hai"
			`	"Yes, though not through our discovery, they met us. At the beginning they threatened us and had extorted us of our resources, a time where we had not yet even discovered the atom. For very many centuries since, we have had peace with our past bullies, our reparation talks with the peaceful Hai were extensive, they do not permit their kind to wander here, and they do not tell of our existence to outsiders, like them we mean to keep peace and this has earned us their favor."`
			`	"I am not personally aware of the events that took place to calm the conquesting Hai but perhaps it can be an example to others. Now, what is it you are here for?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm just passing through."`
					goto "pass"
				`	"I'm just a tourist, seeing all there is to see."`
			`	"We have very few 'tourists' here on Arx, I anticipated the feat of engineering that is our home to draw visitors however. Whichever is the cause for the lack of traffic, it doesn't matter, we have matters that take priority over tourism. If you wish to explore our home you are welcome but do not become a hindrance or you will no longer be welcome here."`
