### too.many.asteroids <br>
<br>
<br>
Removes all non-mineable asteroids from all systems. Mineable asteroids and asteroid belts are untouched. <br>
Increases game performance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Every of the 558 base game systems (0.10.7) is edited via a remove command for full compatibility with other system altering plugins. A total of 2663 asteroid entries got removed.<br>
In case I don't update this plugin to the newest game version, a python script for generating an updated plugin can be found <a href="https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/tools/ES_plugin_script_too_many_asteroids">here</a>.<br>
