## Downloads

- [üì¶ Ruin-The-Fun: Sources](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/archive/refs/heads/main.zip):
  This is the latest commit to the plugin. It may or may not be stable, and it may also not work at all or break your save.
- [üéÅ Ruin-The-Fun: Tested Release](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/latest) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/latest/download/-es-ruin-the-fun.zip):
  This is a tested and recommended version. But perhaps not the latest.
  Has better plugin support than other releases.
- [üì¶ Ruin-The-Fun: (Automatic Updates)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/):
  This version is automatically generated on every new game version (either pre-release or release).
  It should feature the latest game content.
  However, if the data file syntax was changed by the new version, this might cause warnings or errors.
- [üì¶ Ruin-The-Fun: (Endless Sky continuous)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/es-continuous) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/download/es-continuous/-es-ruin-the-fun-for-es-continuous.zip):
  This version is periodically generated to match continuous builds of Endless Sky. This is also the latest untested RTF version.
  If you do not use continuous Endless Sky builds, do not use this version, as it will contain things that are not yet in you game (that will be a problem).



## Install

Install this plugin by dropping it into the game's `plugins` folder.
If the plugin is in a `.zip` / archive file, extract it.

The game's `plugins` folder should be located at one of those locations:
- On Windows:
  - `plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)`
  - or `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\`
- On Linux:
  - `/usr/share/games/endless-sky/plugins/`
  - or `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`
- On Mac:
  - `Contents/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)`
  - or `~/Library/Application Support/endless-sky/plugins`

If the `plugins` folder does not exist, you can create it.

If you did it right, there should be a file `plugins/-es-ruin-the-fun/about.txt` or `plugins/-Ruin The Fun/about.txt`.

> This plugin should not conflict with any other, because it uses separate systems and prefixes objects it defines.



## Startup

‚ö†Ô∏è **Be advised against using this plugin with your favorite pilot's save**, since it will make your hours of labor nonsensical.
If you want to use this plugin for an existing save anyway, then **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PILOT** (for instance with the `Add snapshot` button).

![add snapshot button](./images/screenshot/add-snapshot.png)

If your intent is rather to use this plugin with a new pilot, you may use one of the starts provided by this plugin to do so:

![new pilot starts menu](./images/screenshot/rtf-starts.png)
You will spawn in an RTF system, from which cheat features are available.

Cheat features are available from, and only from, the RTF systems. One of them has an hyperlink to `Rutilicus` (the default start system), so that you can reach it with an Hyperdrive:

![map screenshot](./images/screenshot/rtf0-on-map.png)

There is other RTF systems everywhere on the map, so you do not have to cross it whole.

## Spaceport

![Spaceport](./images/screenshot/spaceport-button.png)

More actions are available from the `Job Board`.



## Job Board

- `[escort] * Barges` (3 variants): Get escorted by dreadful Star Barges.
- `[escort] Escort Fleets`: Select fleets to spawn as NPC escorts.

- `[toggle] Hide RTF Systems`: Hide the RTF systems, so that they do not interfere.
- `[toggle] Super Reach`: While in an RTF system, you can jump to any system on the map, even without a God Drive. By default, RTF systems have a lower jump range, to lower their impact on surrounding content.
- `[toggle] Variants`: Enable ship variants in the RTF shipyards.



## Shipyard

![Shipyard](./images/screenshot/shipyard-button.png)

From the RFT shipyards, all ships in the game are available to you.



## Outfitter

![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/outfitter-button.png)

From the RTF outfitters, all outfits in the game are available to you.

RTF also adds a few outfits, all listed under the `RTF God Outfits` category:
- `God Drive`: Jump drive, with no range limit, that does not consume fuel.
- `God Mode`: Makes you immortal.
- `God Turret`: Turret that one-shot any ships.
- `God Disabling Turret`: Disables ships without destroying them.
- `100000 Outfit Space`: Gives you more than enough outfit space.
- `100000 Cargo Space`: Gives you so much cargo space that this will trigger pirate raids.

You can also find outfits that only change a single stat in the `Individual Stats` category. They look like this:
![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/wheel-examples.png)



## Updating Content

You can **update the plugin's vanilla content** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make update

You may have to set the path to the Endless Sky `data` folder as instructed.

You can **include content from other plugins** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make plugin-update

This will only work if all plugins, including RTF, are in the same `plugins` folder.



## Assets (placeholders)

You can use those assets as placeholders:
 - [Outfits](./images/outfit/rtf/)
 - [Sounds](./sounds/)

Info about individual assets are available from [./copyright](./copyright).



## Moving an RTF system

You can use a mission and an event like this to move a RTF system to your plugin's galaxy:
```
mission "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
    landing
    on offer
        event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
        fail
event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
	system "RTF10"
		pos -2700 -1500
```
