# es-ruin-the-fun

Cheat plugin for [endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), to ruin your fun, or to assist you in making or testing another plugin.

Ruin-The-Fun lets you change your captain's name, choose the color swizzle of your ships, edit your relation with other governments, set your combat rank, hire a powerful escort, gift yourself pre-outfitted ships, give yourself money, and much more. It also makes all ships and outfits available from a few added systems.



# Startup

This assumes you have installed and enabled the plugin. If not, see [Install Instructions](#install-instructions).

⚠️ **Be advised against using this plugin with your favorite pilot's save**, since it will make your hours of labor nonsensical.
If you want to use this plugin for an existing save anyway, then **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PILOT** (for instance with the `Add snapshot` button).

![new pilot menu](./images/screenshot/add-snapshot.png)

If your intent is rather to use this plugin with a new pilot, you may use one of the starts provided by this plugin to do so:

![new pilot menu](./images/screenshot/rtf-starts.png)
You will spawn in an RTF system, from which cheat features are available.

Cheat features are available from, and only from, the RTF systems. One of them has an hyperlink to `Rutilicus` (the default start system), so that you can reach it with an Hyperdrive:

![new pilot menu](./images/screenshot/rtf0-on-map.png)

There is other RTF systems everywhere on the map, so you do not have to cross it whole.

The following jobs are toggles, their effect is reverted when you abort them:
- `Hide RTF Systems`: Hide the RTF systems, so that they do not interfere.
- `Super Reach`: While in an RTF system, you can jump to any system on the map, even without a God Drive. By default, RTF systems have a lower jump range, to lower their impact on surrounding content.

# Install Instructions

This plugin was last made for endless-sky `v0.10.2`, but is likely to include later content.

To install this plugin, put it as a folder (not an archive/zip file) inside the `plugins` folder.
The `plugins` folder should be located at one of those locations:
- On Windows:
  - `plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)`
  - or `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\`
- On Linux:
  - `/usr/share/games/endless-sky/plugins/`
  - or `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

## Plugin Conflicts
All the content added by this plugin is prefixed, to avoid conflicts with other plugins.

## Updating Content
You can **update the plugin's vanilla content** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make update

You may have to set the path to the Endless Sky `data` folder as instructed.

You can **include content from other plugins** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make plugin-update

This will only work if all plugins, including RTF, are in the same `plugins` folder.

## Moving an RTF system
You can use a mission and an event like this to move a RTF system to your plugin's galaxy:
```
mission "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
    landing
    on offer
        event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
        fail
event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
	system "RTF10"
		pos -2700 -1500
