	description "The X-70B Phantom-class prototype was a prototype starship of the reconstituted Sith Empire used by Imperial Intelligence. X-70Bs were so technologically advanced they were never mass-produced. Instead, they were elite vessels bestowed upon only the most trusted intelligence agents for the most vital missions to the Empire during the Great Galactic War. The ships were coated with a sensor-resistant exterior and equipped with the most sophisticated equipment and weapons. Their powerful sensor arrays had the ability to scan the interiors of other ships, even over large distances."
