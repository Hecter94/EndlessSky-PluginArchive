			`As you land, your message indicator flashes amber, indicating a high-priority message.`
			` Activating the reciever, a familiar voice begans to speak: `			
			`"	<first>, It's Admiral Danforth, I've recieved reports of a Kor Sestor drone in Republic space, flying non-regulation colours, and I need someone to check it out." He pauses, and from what you can hear, he's sratching his chin. "Now, normally I'd send someone of my own, but since most of my men lost at least someone to the drones, I'd thought I'd ask you, as you aren't as likely to blow it out of the sky." It makes sense, yet you still feel a bit queasy about having to come face to face with another of those damned drones. `
			`"Now, I don't want you to blow the bloody thing up, just scan it's outfits. I've sent you a specific resonance to scan their Control Receiver logs, maybe we can figure out where it's been, just make sure to be here in one piece, alright?`

				goto DanforthReport

			` Turning around to leave, you're just about to head out of the lobby, when Danforth's office door opens and you see his silvered head poke out.

			` Your last thoughts are literally what the hell did that button do- `
			` `
			` `
			` `
			` Dan The Space Trucker always hated to go to Farpoint, the Republic always charge twice as much tax more than he thought was necessary, and there were NO girls to be found! Not one! But he had scored a nice shipment of Heavy Metals on the way there, courtesy of an exploding Pirate, so he was looking forward to landing when the entire planet collapses inside itself, leaving a slight gravitional depression in it's wake. `
			` Dan, resolving never to take PipUps before jumping ever again, turns his Star Barge around and heads home. `
				die 
			label DanforthReport
			` Entering Danforth's office, he gestures to sit down on the other side of a very plain metal desk, with a picture of a lovely woman off to the side. There's a filing cabinet labelled with 'Pirate Bullshit', 'Alien Suprises', 'Letters From Son' (this one is overflowing with cheap postcards), and one labelled 'Stuff I Should Be Scared Of'. You both sit down, and Danforth puts his hands on the table. "So, what did you find, <first>? `
			choice	
				`	"One of their heavy drones, with outfits from the Hai, and it was just kinda, sitting there."`
					goto normalanswer
				`	"One of their big buggers, the ones that looks like if a pair of pants decided to go to war." `

					goto alphas
			label normalanswer
			` "Interesting", Danforth mutters, and then goes silent, contemplating the dire possibility of a Korath-Hai teamup. You mention that it was flying under the Flag of the 'Overseers', whatever they may be. `
			` "Overseers?" Danforth says, reaching over to his 'Alien Suprises' folder and pulling out a datapad labelled 'Rumours and Legends'. "Hm.... I'm not seeing anything in here, I'm not sure if that's good or bad." He sighs, powers down the datapad, and replaces it in the cabinet. "Now, about that data..." `
			choice
				` 	"Right, here it is!" `
					goto hands
			label wierdanswer 
				` Danforth, raising his eyes to the heavens, muttering what appears to be a prayer, just pulls out a paper folder from a drawer in his desk, and marks something inside it. Replacing the folder into his desk, he places his head on his hands and looks at you, mildly irritated by your apparent lack of concern. "Now, the data?" `
			choice 
				`	"Don worry fam, i got it right here!" `
					goto hands
				
			label alphas
			` Raising his eyebrows in an expression of borderline shock, Danforth turns and and opens the folder labelled 'Stuff I Should Be Scared Of', and pulls out a red-coated datapad. You hasten to reassure him that you only noticed that it was similar to Alpha colouring, as it was actually flying under the colours of the 'Overseers', and did not appear hostile. Heaving a heavy sigh of relief, he puts his datapad back in the cabinet, and turns back to face you. "So, did you manage to scan the ship?" `
			choice
				` 	"Sure, it's in my pocket, hold on a sec." `

					goto behaviour	
			label outfits
			` You start to explain in detail the outfits you encountered, and then realize, a bit belatedly, that you literally just handed Danforth an outfit scan, and that he's looking at you with his eyebrows raised. After you fall silent, he goes back to perusing the scan. "Odd, why would an Ik Vot have Hai gear?" Danforth muses. He sighs, and puts down the datapad. "No matter, I'll send this to the lab, and they'll take a look at it." He rises. "Well, the lab should have the data out by tomorrow, so meet me by the Spaceport then." `
			` Exitting his office, you glare at the secretary on your way out.`
			label behaviour
			` Having handed Danforth the data, you began to explain the Ik Vot's behaviour, highlighting the fact it seemed to be observing the regions close to the uninhabited sections of space north of Sol. "Fascinating." Danforth says, preoccupied with the scan. "Well, it's certainly armed for war." He says, putting the datapad facedown on his desk. He gets out of his chair, and walks over to you, outstretching his hands to help you out of your chair. "Well, let's hope the lab can tell us something about where this damn thing came from," he says, pulling you out of your chair with a suprisingly strong grip. `
			` He leads you out of his office, nodding to the secretary on the way out. "We should have the data by tomorrow, so come by tomorrow, and we'll figure out who these damn 'Overseers' are." `

			`Entering the base, you notice that the secretary has been replaced with a younger, infinitely nicer woman. After confirming your identity, she hits the intercom.
