	description "The Gorga'Wrath is the Gorga's most powerful design, being able to stand up to pretty much anything the Overseers through at them."
	description "Due to recent perceived peace with the Overseers, production has been lax for the past century."
	description "It is rumoured that there is no more than a few dozen Gorga'Wraths still in use, a rumour that the more patriotic of the Gorga will come to blows over."

	description "Gorga'Quips are the weakest ship in the Gorga's force, and most Gorga dread being assigned to one, mainly in that it's main use is distraction, protecting larger Gorga ships from fire, and allowing them to close in on enemies and eviserate them using Incisor Beams."
	description "Due to the Quip's close range role, their shields are relatively twice as strong than other Gorga craft."

	description "'Mektar class warships are the main Gorga Warship, used in both frontline fighting and support roles. 
	description "'Mektars, having multiple Incisor Beams, do not have the Gorga Turrets. They instead have four Clawgrips, helping to bring in their prey."
	description "'Mektars also have strangely high heat dissipation for their size, a testament to a design that has been improved for generations."
