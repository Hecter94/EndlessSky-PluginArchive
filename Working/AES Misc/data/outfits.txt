	description `The construction of the new Scud drones prompted a need for an even smaller engine complement than was available at the time. This lead to the creation of the Type 0 Radiant Engine, the Wanderers first ever hybrid engines systems, capable of achieving speeds comparable to a set of Type 1 engines whilst remaining significantly smaller.`
	description `This efficiency serves as a reminder to the Wanderers that their engineering has not stagnated, and that they are still capable of progressing their technology.`

	description `Despite their imposing stature, Quarg bodies are relatively frail and weak when compared to other species. To overcome their natural disadvantages in ground combat, they developed this suit, which combines a flexible, cold nanofiber with a powered, armored exoskeleton, with small, dark porous bits on each end of the forearms, which can focus energy in one particular direction, essentially firing a miniature blaster.`
	description `	On top of it all, the suit can momentarily generate a powerful personal shield, providing very high protection to the wearer for its duration. But the Quarg have other means of defending their ships, so this combat suit is almost exclusively used for the ground defense of Quarg ringworlds.`
