			`A voice says, "This system is restricted. You should stay away."`
			`	A moment goes by, with no reasonable explanation you wonder if that sound was just in your head. The words do however remain, as if burned into your mind.`
			choice
				`	(Ignore it.)`
				`	"What's so dangerous that I can't be here?"`
					goto why
				`	"Who are you to tell me what to do?"`
					goto why
			`	"You should stay away." The thought repeats itself, again without warning. You begin to question your wellbeing, or perhaps it really is there.`
			choice
				`	"What's so dangerous that I can't be here?"`
				`	"Who are you to tell me what to do?"`
			label why
			`	You feel a massive rush through your body, as if drowning under some inexplicable emotion. "Human, you would regret ignoring the reservations of the Drak. I am here to tend to the minds of the Forsaken, and they must not be disturbed during their healing. You would fare better to leave me to my task and continue your ill-fated journey."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean, 'tend to the minds of the Forsaken'?"`
				`	"What happened to the Forsaken?"`
				`	"Okay. I'm leaving."`
					decline
			`	"A great calamity befell this species long ago, they regressed to a state of disrepair that rendered them helpless to the challenges they would otherwise find trivial." As the voice says this, a pain reveals itself within your mind, as if a cancer is spreading at an unprecedented rate, you feel as though all your past experiences are fading with it's presence.`
			choice
				`	"What is happening?!"`
				`	"Why are you doing this!"`
			`	Your processes are slowing and then reorienting, things feel different, as though you are no longer the same person. You make your desperate pleas for salvation, for help. Dark figures linger in the shadows but you don't see them, you can't see, and they are whispering, waiting.`
			choice
				`	"I know what you are!"`
				`	"Stop hiding from me!"`
			`	The shadows grow, reaching for you, grasping for what the light abandons, waiting. The darkness ensues and you submit, reaching for the man in the corner.`
			`	"Be gone, quick." the voice says. The cancer within your head seems to fall away, and you are left talking to thin air, with no more than a hazy experience to carry with you. Perhaps it was a warning.`
