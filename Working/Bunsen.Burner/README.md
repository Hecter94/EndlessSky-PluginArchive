### Bunsen Burner ###

**Author: [Nick Barry](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry)**

An overhaul and re-publication of [Flamethrower-Turret-1.1.0](https://github.com/ItsNickBarry/endless-sky-flamethrower-turret). Since the last update of the plugin in January 2021 the Flamethrower was nerfed and got a new outfit image, so the Flamethrower Turret didn't fit anymore to the vanilla Flamethrower.

Therefore, N.Barry's turret was combined with the old vanilla Flamethrower image it was based on to create a next-generation Flamethrower which burns hotter -- the Bunsen Burner. Now with *blue* flames. Naturally, as we are used to, one has to complete Barmy's weapon test mission, written by N.Barry, to unlock it.

Also Darcy Manoel's H2H flamethrower, which is based on the same design, was added as the Bunsen Torch. Available during the war, it will be banned afterwards as inhumane and only be obtainable on Pirate-ruled planets. However, legally bought torches still won't be fined because of exception rules in the corresponding paragraphs.
