	description "Being a more sophisticated version of the flamethrower, the Bunsen Burner represents the epitome of Free Worlds creative extravagance. So great are its fuel requirements that it comes with a standard fuel pod pre-installed, though no prudent captain would leave port without a reliable ramscoop as well. Smaller ships which lack powerful cooling systems should stay out of range at all costs."

So great are its fuel requirements that it comes with a standard fuel pod pre-installed, though no prudent captain would leave port without a reliable ramscoop as well. Smaller ships which lack powerful cooling systems try to stay out of range at all costs, so you might want to purchase this fine turret."
