	description "As large as some ships, the Arcblade is the ultimate weapon of the Trin: a conical death ray that can level a fleet in an instant. Even the enormous Antiarch could not hope to power the Arcblade off instantaneous power, and it takes a significant time to charge a second shot... but who's to say you'll need it?"
