	description "The Trin Shunt Drive is clearly based very closely on the mysterious Jump Drive. While it seems to be enhanced in some ways, it's not clear even the Trin understand their modifications. The result activates faster and is able to perform ordinary fast hyper jumps much like a Scram Drive, but takes up more outfit space than other Jump Drives and saps your ship's energy generation while plugged in."

	description "All Trin ships are protected by an integrated shield matrix with powerful regenerative abilities, but several of their warships are outfitted with Matrix Amplifiers to further boost their defences. Amplifiers are far more effective than traditional shield generators, and a matrix reinforced by one is much more difficult to pierce or disrupt."

Missiles and detailed scanners have enormous difficulty penetrating a ship protected by the haze of uncertainty a Shroud creates. However, maintaining a functional Shroud saps a ship's energy generation significantly."

	description "This 'Lantern' class Trin drive is their smallest integrated engine, and it's an impressive feat of engineering that combines main drive, attitude control and reverse thrust.

A single Beacon Drive can make a battleship fly almost like a fighter, but there might not be much power left for weapons. Like all Trin drives, the Beacon Drive is fully integrated, including reverse thrust."
