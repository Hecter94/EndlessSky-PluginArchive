# epic-trucker

Plugin for Endless Sky https://endless-sky.github.io/

This plug-in adds additional cargo and passenger (and both at once) missions to the game increasing the scale and scope for a player who wants to focus on running a huge trucker shipping delivery passenger service.

Please check "Releases" for functional releases - whatever is currently in source may be a work in progress. I release code when it is in a stable, tested state so check there!

Alright you gear-jamming hyperspace truckers, this message is brought to you by your good ol' boys at Meganthium Trucking Company, THE Mega Truck Co. Find yourself doing a lot of shopping and price comparison trying to fill up all that cargo space? Maybe you've found gravy town and got yourself a little convoy and are ready to move up to the big leagues? Well we at Mega Truck Co. have you covered. Bigger jobs for a big galaxy. Get your cargo and passenger space up high enough and you'll start getting bigger and larger jobs with more bonus payout. With around fifty billion humans making and taking, it has never been a better time to be a trucker, hauler, ferry, or cabby. 

Why not go into the big leagues and find yourself some truely EPIC deliveries to fulfill? These special missions come co-sponsored by yours truely, Max Hammer, CEO, Mega Truck Co. These enormous, mega, and epic missions are all high-risk. You'll run into corporations looking to get even or just level the competition. You might even get targetted by the biggest and bravest pirates around who want to steal all that cargo. You aren't just hauling big volume; I need you to keep that cargo safe!

Features:
-=-=-=-

Additional jobs which become unlocked with higher cargo and passenger count. These are copies of the vanilla jobs with a few tweaks to both increase minimums and push the maximum sizes way up - and also their default bonuses. After all, hiring you to do it in one saves them on logistics. There are also more jobs for moving criminals (needs the brig) and more for wealthy patrons (needs luxury) and added one or two fun little but high payout jobs such as a wealthy enthusiast who wants to brag about having gotten a ride with such a legendary captain! (Requires high net-worth)

Right now these extra jobs should come into a vanilla campaign over time as you grow your fleet, either with many haulers or just a couple huge rigs. Most of these jobs are slightly more rare to cut down on job-overload. For now though, once you're an epic trucker you will see nearly 50% more jobs each day.

*Existing Compatible*
This can be safely added or removed from an existing game. I've tested this myself on Windows and Ubuntu (Linux) only. When adding, you won't see new jobs until you land again (if you're already landed it won't prompt to check for new jobs until you take off). If you remove it, you will keep whatever jobs you have as they're part of your save file -- you will just stop seeing these jobs (again, only once you take off). 

*Mod Compatible*
This should work with any other mods because this only adds jobs and does not try to tweak existing stuff. 
Once we add any overrides to phase out vanilla shipping, however, this will become more complicated. This isn't implemented yet.

Installation Instructions: 
-=-=-=-

Download the ZIP file and extract it into your plugins folder. 
Alternately, you can just git clone directly into the plugins folder
Make sure you are only one folder with the name of the mod which directly contains the "data" folder - if you're two levels deep the plugin loader wont find and load the plugin.

You'll know it is working if you have over 200 cargo or 6 passengers and you see missions with "Bigger" "Larger" "Many" "A Big Family" and similar things in their name

Future:
-=-=-=-

* Override for existing main jobs to phase them out over time as your cargo + passengers + net worth go up. 
* Add 3rd tier of mega jobs and have them phase in over time as the big ones also phase out. No one wants to be cluttered with "deliver 5 tons" when you're doing "deliver 2200 tons" and the job system can get overloaded and noisy.
* More jobs for cargo + passengers from special regions, like corporate retreat for 200+ people, or help setup a colony 1000tons and 100 people
* High Risk job line which requires certain net worth and combat rating on top of cargo and passenger which involves turbo pirate and later, ELITE enemies
* Deep, Syndicate, and FW specific jobs
* Eliminating Large Industry Transport Executives - ELITE Pirate force as special antagonists using large pools of vessels including checking for modded ones to be the antagonists for EPIC jobs
* Mega Truck Co. HQ with special mission line and some cute custom loadouts for basic haulers, freighters, etc as well as the atomic fusion bactrian "MEGA TRUCK" rig just for fun, nothing game breaking nor outside of vanilla game
* Extra banter from merchants and major factions once you've completed EPIC or MEGA jobs which allows setting to appear to be aware you are a truely epic trucker
