	description "The D408 is a particularly hefty model of laser rifle whose parent models saw use during the alpha wars. Reliable, durable, and powerful, these guns still see use today. Some have even tried to use them against ships, seeing as how the D408 was based on rugged, vacuumproof designs."
	description "The only notable downside of the D408 is, perhaps ironically, its biggest innovation over older models: the weapon sports heavy-duty heatsinks, which weigh down the weapon, but permit considerable sustained fire."

	description "Built for anti-materiel roles, the H92 actually does see some crew-to-ship use on lower-tech worlds, where ground militias will attempt to shoot weak points on incoming enemy cargo transports to cripple or destroy them. Firing an immensely powerful slug, the weapon is able to pierce ship shields, allowing it to rip directly into a ship's innards."

	description `Stretching the definition of "Man-Portable", the IXR Handheld Plasma Cannon is designed to do considerable damage even to fortified structures or vehicles. For this reason, it is quite popular on landbound transports, where it allows an otherwise out-gunned vehicle to compete with a heavier-armored threat.`
	description "Because of the intense heat produced by the plasma generator, the weapon is designed to vent excess heat over time, rather than shunting it all out into the wielder all at once."

		"ion damage" 0.03
	description `A weapon of Hai design, the "Ra Koot" Pulse Rifle is designed to be used by boarding troops to disable a ship's internals without severely damaging it. The weapon achieves this by firing directed electromagnetic pulses, which are shaped and guided by the barrel.`
	description `Though its physical damage is very low, the weapon excels at crippling shields in addition to power systems.`

		"firing energy" 4
		"firing heat" 2
	description "Though missiles are typically too small for a manual operator to effectively intercept, the 115-YL Smart Rifle features ammunition that guides itself towards a target within its scanning field; all a user has to do is have the trigger held down on an applicable target. For this reason, the 115 finds itself most often in an anti-munitions role, though it's less suited for ship-sized projectiles."

	description `A "Jenkins" is slang for a human foolish enough to attempt to destroy a ship without a ship of their own. Nowadays, there has been some refinement of the concept, but nothing particularly spectacular. Equipped with a space suit designed with shield matrix technology and an integral generator, some captains hire hordes of "Jenkinses" to pelt their enemy with copious amounts of small arms' fire, whittling down the hull of a small ship enough for the Jenkinses' owner to get the upper hand.`
