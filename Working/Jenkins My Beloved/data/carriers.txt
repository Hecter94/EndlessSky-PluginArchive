	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."
	description "	Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is normally only for sale to citizens who have been vetted by the local government of the Deep."

	description `The introduction of humans to the Hai civilization has led to a substantial amount of cultural exchange. While some may argue that pickled acorns have been the greatest product of this relationship, many more will point to this luxury transport ship. The product of human-Hai cooperation from the project's inception, the Centipede was released around the turn of the 31st century, but has already become quite popular among Hai fleets.`

	description `The Spire is the largest passenger transport in Coalition space, able to carry nearly three hundred individuals... as long as they're comfortable staying in the tiny bunk rooms that are primarily designed to meet the needs of a Kimek. Most of the ceilings are too short for a Saryd to stand up straight, and the beds are too small for an Arach to stretch their legs out comfortably.`

	description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves equally well as a passenger transport or a cargo courier. It also happens to be the cheapest ship you can buy which is capable of hyperspace travel."
	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`
	description `	This augmented version of the shuttle carries up to 10 Jenkinses for crew-to-ship combat.`

	description "The Star Queen is a relic of a more peaceful period of galactic history: a luxury liner for high-end tourists. Every cabin has its own mini-bar, and the bathrooms have marble tile and showers that use actual hot water instead of chemicals or sonic vibrations."
	description "	In support of environmental movements across the galaxy, all Star Queens come standard with an array of solar panels as their only source of energy as opposed to more popular power generators such as fuel cells or nuclear reactors that produce some amount of waste. Although some argue that this is a pointless move given the prevalence of clean fusion reactors, others have applauded it and cited the prohibitive costs of fusion reactors as a reason for using solar panels."
