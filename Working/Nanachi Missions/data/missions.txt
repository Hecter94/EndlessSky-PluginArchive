			`	The Hai is a bit startled, but quickly calms down. "Sorry, you caught me by surprise. I've just bought my first ship and need to find some jobs to do, but right now there aren't any cargo jobs small enough for my ship to handle. I just don't know what to do anymore, I've been working for so long to qualify for this loan, but I'm running out of time and I'll never be able to pay it like this."`
			`	Turns out the documents she's holding are the bank papers for the loan, somewhat similar to the one you took when you bought your first ship. You've come a long way since your days as a beginner, and know how hard it is to be starting out as a starship captain. You could probably convince someone here to offer a simple cargo job to this young Hai.`

				`	"I'm sorry to hear that, but I can't do anything to help you."`

				decline
			label help
			`	Her ears twitch a bit, and her previously crestfallen eyes light up as she nearly jumps in joy at your offer. "Thank you so much captain! My name is Nanachi, I promise I won't cause any trouble at all, just a few quick jobs and I'm sure I'll be fine by myself!"`
			`	You introduce yourself to Nanachi and shake her paw. "Can you show me your ship so I can look for jobs it's best suited for?" you ask.`
			`	She hesitates a bit, but leads you to her ship. You were expecting a small Hai ship, but to your surprise she shows you a rather beat-up Heavy Shuttle docked near your own ship.`
			`	"You took a loan to buy a human ship?" you ask.`
			`	She looks at the ground, as if ashamed of it. "It'd take way too long for me to qualify for a loan for even an Aphid, but I recently met a human merchant who wanted to sell his old ship; it was difficult but I managed to convince him to sell it to me instead of going to the shipyard office. I paid him its full price, but even for this one I had to take out the biggest loan I could. Its cargo hold isn't very impressive but it's got more bunks than our smallest ships, if that helps."`
			choice
				`	"Let's see if anyone in the spaceport needs a lift off the planet."`
				`	"Let's take another look at the job board, maybe a smaller job will pop up."`
			`	Turns out this isn't as easy as you thought it'd be. The spaceport is almost empty, save for the occasional worker or drunken crewmember, and the job board is filled with massive hauls of minerals, aside from a few small but dangerous jobs to human space. Eventually, as you two begin scouting the edge of the docking area, you spot a troubled human merchant near several crates. You approach him and he explains that his ship had some malfunctions and he cannot deliver his cargo of advanced surgical equipment to <destination>. "This is the worst! One jump away from the planet and the navigation system suddenly decides to go on strike! There's no way I can make it before the deadline!"`
			`	"My friend Nanachi here could deliver it for you. We were heading there anyway; a few extra crates won't make a difference," you say, trying to sound as convincing as possible.`
			`	At first he seems delighted that you two want to help him, but when Nanachi mentions that she's flying a Heavy Shuttle, he frowns, and looks back at the cargo. "Unfettered attacks make it so they need tons of medical supplies in <destination>, and quite frankly I'm not comfortable letting such a fragile ship go into dangerous territory carrying this equipment when it could be blasted to bits in an instant," he says. The captain glances around the deserted spaceport for a while, as if trying to find some other captain, before finally turning to Nanachi and saying, "but I guess beggars can't be choosers. Fine, I'll let you take the cargo there, but please be very careful."`

"So, how did you like your first time doing a hyperspace jump?" you ask, to try and snap her out of it.`
			`	"Oh um, I don't think I'll get used to the feeling anytime soon. I threw up a lot so I'm glad this wasn't a job with passengers. I've always dreamt of being on other worlds, exploring and learning everything about them. I'm glad I'm finally able to do it."`
			`	You help her get the crates out of the cargo hold and contact the client. Nanachi's share of the payment is small, as the client transfers most of the money to the merchant she got the job from, but that doesn't make her any less excited about getting her first paycheck.`
			`	"So, want to go to the spaceport and try to get a job on your own? I'll help you again in case you can't do it yet." you say.`
			`	"Just give me an hour or two, back home our shipyard is kind of small, and I've never really gotten a chance to see a Shield Beetle up close, and there are many undergoing repairs here, I'll just go get a better look at them, I swear I'll be quick."`
			`	You two agree to meet in the spaceport in a few hours, maybe this time she will do fine on her own.`

			`You meet up with Nanachi in the spaceport, give her some tips to try and persuade someone into hiring her, and tell her you'll be nearby if she still has trouble getting a job. You watch her go around the spaceport and approach some groups of humans and even other Hai to no avail, maybe since this is a military world they aren't too keen on helping others as in the rest of their territory. She manages to grab the attention of a Hai family leaving a restaurant carrying way too much luggage, most likely tourists looking for a ride back home. Everything seems to be going well until the parents start to look worried. It seems as if they might go away if you don't step in.`
			`	You walk over to the group to help her, and get a better look at the family: a Hai couple carrying a baby, and three older children who aren't doing much to help their father carry their ludicrous amount of bags.`
			choice
				`	"Hey, what's going on?"`
				`	"Can I be of assistance?"`
			`	You introduce yourself and the parents tell you that they've been on vacation here and need transport back to Hai-home. "Don't take this the wrong way, but captain Nanachi told us her ship is one of your human ships, a Heavy Shuttle was it? It has enough bunks for us but our sons already caused a ruckus on the way here in a Hai ship, we're worried that since they aren't used to the accomodations they might end up giving her too much trouble."`
			`	You reassure them that the trip will be very quick, and that the ship's interior is somewhat similar to that of Hai ships, until they finally agree on going with her. They settle on the pay and you two help the Hai get their baggage to Nanachi's ship. When the family is focused on a conversation, you quietly ask Nanachi what was the issue she was having with the other people she encountered.`
			`	"They all seemed willing to give me a job, but I ended up blowing it when I asked for more money. I just really need to get out of debt so I guess I went a bit overboard." She tries to play it cool, but it's clear that she is embarrased about losing so many potential jobs. When you reach her ship you take a look at the prices for commodities in Hai-home. You decide to tell Nanachi to stock up on heavy metals to sell there, to help her make a bit more profit.`

Those kids kept wanting to play with the ship's controls, and one of them tried to go up the air vent in a game of hide-and-seek. I couldn't get any rest since I had to keep making sure they weren't about to dump their own bags into the void by accident."`
			`	"Do you want to get some sleep before trying to find another mission?" you ask, hoping she won't try to overwork herself. "Yes, I could really use that. Sorry to make you wait again captain <last>. I'll rest a bit, see if I can't find a tourist spot nearby to relax, and meet up with you the in spaceport after a while."`

			`You send a message to Nanachi and meet up in the spaceport. You're still walking toward the job board when she asks: "Back home I heard stories about how humans have a much larger population than the Hai, and that their home planet has even more people than Hai-home Is it true that there are many other human worlds with spaceports this large?" You name a few populous human planets, and how even some planets with fewer people than this world have incredibly large spaceports.`
			`	While you tell her stories of many different planets you've been to, she seems to be particularly interested in Earth. "I've seen a bit of human architecture in videos of planets like Allhome, but I can't even imagine what your capital must look like. Tens of thousands of years of another species' history, it sounds even more exciting than what I heard about our landmarks in Hai-home. Captain, do you think that someday, when we no longer need to be kept hidden from humanity, that I'll be able to visit Earth, and see the beauty of your capital?" Seeing how little she knows about humanity, it's not surprising that she is unaware of Earth's current state.`

					goto board

			`	You start making up stories about how beautiful the skies of Earth are. You describe forests teeming with life, and do your best to remember ancient civilizations and their monuments. From the looks of it she believes you, and your lie seems to have sated her curiosity for now. If the day where the Hai are allowed to move around human space ever comes, though, she will no doubt be extremely disappointed.`
					goto board
			label truth
			`	She looks at you in confusion, as if trying to understand what you mean, so you explain it to her. "Centuries of widespread deforestation and pollution badly damaged the ecosystem. If you ever managed to visit you'd be better off going to museums or monuments, but even then there are many thieves roaming the streets, and it is very dangerous to be out at night. Lots of folks born there just think about how to get out."`
			`	You keep telling her about the issues facing humanity's birthplace, and her previous eagerness to learn about the planet fades. "How could your ancestors let their own home become like this?"`
			choice
				`	"It's rather complicated, and I'm not a historian, sociologist, or economist, but I can try and explain what I do know."`
			`	You recite what you read in school books or saw in documentaries, telling her about how many humans since millenia ago refused to take care of the planet, and how that piled up over hundreds of years.`
			`	Your explanation seems to only torment Nanachi even more. "But why is your capital so full of criminals? Is human space going through a crisis that hit even your capital?"`
			choice
				`	"In some sense, the crisis has been going on since we were aware of it."`
			`	You do your best in telling her of the historical presence of crime on Earth, and of how little was done to address the root of the problem.`
			`	"I see..." She says. "I just thought it would be fun to hear about another large planet like Hai-home. Sorry for asking about it captain, I'm sure having to speak of it wasn't a pleasant feeling."`
			`	Although you're sure that even in Hai space there is social inequality, she probably can't fathom that the home planet of a species could be in such bad shape, considering the Hai even go as far as to send aid to the Unfettered on a regular basis.`
					goto board

			`	You two reach the job board and decide to start looking for jobs suited for Nanachi's ship.`
			choice
				`"So, do you mind if I help out?  I know the job board can be confusing the first few times you check it."`
			`	"Thanks, but I have to do this on my own. I promise I won't mess this up by getting greedy again," She approaches the board on her own, and it becomes clear that it's much easier to get a job here: she's barely started talking to one of the desk workers before receiving a long list of jobs for smaller ships. She is certainly still very tired, but this seems to have cheered her up a bit, it is the first time she can get a job without your help after all.`
			`	While you thought she would've picked one or two jobs quickly and headed back to her ship, she keeps going through them and double checking the information for each one, as if something about them bothers her.`
			`	"What's wrong? Are you struggling to pick between two different jobs?" you ask.`
			`	"These all seem very easy and I could even accept many at a time, but the problem is their pay isn't very good." She grabs some worn papers from her pocket, and shows it to you: they're the documents for her loan. "The bank back home would only give me enough for the ship if I agreed on a short-term loan. I lost two days before you came along to help me, and if I don't get some better paying job soon I won't even be able to pay the interest."`
			`	As you're trying to figure out a way to get the most out of the available missions, you feel a tap on your shoulder, and turn to see a Hai standing beside a human couple. The couple introduce themselves as Xavier and Vanessa, who are here with their Hai friend Narancia. "We overheard your conversation and are willing to pay a little extra for a job. We're part of a group organizing a big festival in Allhome to celebrate the friendship between humans and Hai, and we just got a last-minute idea: we've already arranged for lots of human cuisine to be transported there, and we'd like to get our hands on some spices the Quarg have in the ringworld here."`
			`	They tell Nanachi that they won't be going along, they already have a transport to Allhome, and will stay here a bit longer to try and advertise the event.`

			`The bar is just as busy as the docks. Many captains here must have transported something for the festival. "Captain <last>, captain Nanachi!" shouts Narancia, beckoning the two of you to join her and the others at their table. You learn that they were inspired by the Hai's own March festival, and wanted to bring small parts of human culture to Hai space.`
			`	"They can't go to our planets and experience it for themselves yet, so we thought about bringing it to them!" Vanessa says.`
			`	"It was very hard to get enough sponsors for this, but after years of hard work we even managed to have famous art pieces be brought here, some of which date back to the European renaissance!" Xavier adds.`
			`	Afterwards the conversation topic shifts to you as a captain, as you describe your journey after buying your first ship, and how you met Nanachi. You're about to order another drink for the group when a grizzled old man barges into the bar, and starts shouting: "The art convoy has been attacked! The freighter managed to escape but they're stranded on Prime now, and the pirates are still out there, patrolling the route to the wormhole!"`
			`	Xavier stands up with a shocked expression. "How? We had a Leviathan escorting them!"`
			`	After catching his breath, the man at the door responds. "The pirates must have been stealing Hai tech from ships going back home. The freighter's captain said they shredded the escort!" Chaos spreads amongst the other captains, and the group sitting with you is in anguish.`
			choice
				`	"Are those art pieces really that valuable?"`
				`	"Can't you just postpone the festival until the pirates are taken care of?"`
			`	Xavier collapses back to the table, holding his head in both hands. "Those paintings and sculptures were our main attraction! They're worth tens of millions! It'll take a month before the Navy ever notices the pirates there and makes it safe for the convoy to come here. The art exhibition is scheduled two weeks from now!"`
			`	As they try to figure out what to do, Nanachi speaks up. "I'll go there. I pilot a human ship and if we just need to transfer cargo from one ship to the other, I could get out of there quickly. Nobody would notice that a Hai ever went there."`
			`	"Are you insane?" Vanessa says, "If they managed to take down that Leviathan, you wouldn't last a second! Besides, our convoy was extremely fast. If even they were caught your chances of outrunning the pirates are next to nothing!"`
			`"Captain <last>," Nanachi turns to you. "I know you already helped me way more than anyone would ever be willing to, and I'm really grateful for that, but would you be willing to help me one last time, to get to that planet, and travel back here?" While it's certain that for a pirate fleet to take down a Leviathan so easily they must be incredibly powerful, and this could be extremely dangerous, you're sure that if Nanachi tries to get to Prime by herself she'll just get herself killed.`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I'll make sure we reach Prime and get back here safely."`
				`	"No, I agreed to help you find and deal with some simple jobs, but I can't risk fighting such a fleet by myself."`
					decline
			`	She thanks you profusely, and promises that she'll pay you for everything as soon as she can. The organizers are a bit hesitant, but seeing as no other captain here has decided to offer them help, they agree to let the two of you go to Prime and retrieve the cargo.`
			`	As you're leaving the bar, Xavier pulls you aside, speaking very quietly, "<last>, I know you're just trying to help this girl, but don't get killed over this. If you run into those pirates don't try to fight them, just rush to Prime."`

"I'll never be able to thank you properly, if not for you I'd still be lost in that spaceport, and would eventually have to go back to my mining job.

Thankfully you take good care of your ship, otherwise the scorching sun might've already damaged the hull, with your shields down here on solid ground'; you yourself are not so lucky, though, as the heat is starting to make you sweat a lot, you feel some short-lived pains in your head from time to time, and the sand is taking in so much light it's difficult to look for long.`

			choice
				`	"Yeah, do you know anything about it?"`
				`	"Depends, who's asking?"`

			`	"You have been tracking it for years, grandpa, I've barely started to help you..." Oliver adds.`
			`	"The point being, we're a family business, if you'll call it that. I know for a fact that proper research on this specimen would open up a whole new infinite galaxy of opportunities to humanity. We just need to find them."`
			choice
				`	"So you have a plan, I take it?"`
				`	"Are you offering to help me or not?"`
			`	"You see <first>," Oliver says. "We have asked some other Captains for help before, back when we didn't have as much theoretical data. We never found the lyonii, but hiring the help of those pilots really burned out our savings. That's when you come in, since your goal also is to acquire a sample specimen."`
			`	Richard becons you to a table, where he opens up a very detailed and up-to-date map of Amazon, and says, "See these red spots? Those mark the major fires the farmers have started over the last three years. These ones that have a grey circle around them were marked by myself. They are all of those with reported sightings of the lyonii."`
			`	"Before gramps starts telling you stories for the next ten hours, I'll give a quick rundown of what we need," Oliver interrupts him. "Basically, we've studied the patterns of all these locations where the Calamagrostis was reportedly seen. We have a few targets, and just need you to fly your ship close to them, look for a spot to land, and then we can go and see if we were right. Then we retrive some specimens."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I believe you. Let's go to my ship."`
				`	"Sure. Just let me get my order."`
			`	Back in your ship, they stay with you in the cockpit, pointing to the first spot they marked. It is close to a very large river. You land in a clearing, barely fitting your ship there without snapping some trees. You accompany Oliver and Richard through the jungle, they cutting some plants that were in the middle of the 'trail' with old machetes. Eventually you reach the exact marked spot, but despite touching around the whole place with the machetes, they cannot locate any of the plants.`
			`	"Ah well, it's never going to be that easy," Richard says. "Still, eventually we should get to a place where we can 'feel' a camouflaged Calamagrostis with the blade. Let's try again."`
			`	You head back to the <ship>, thankfully not getting lost in the process, and start flying to the next spot, this time close to a valley. You land, go to the exact location, and not a trace of the lyonii. You head to the next spot, then the next. After a couple hours, the sun starts to set, and many dark clouds start forming close to the next place you're headed to, threatening to rain heavily. A lightning bolt strikes your ship, but your shields easily stop the discharge.`
			`	"It might be best to turn back now, Captain," Oliver says. "The sun has almost completely set and the rain will make it even more difficult to walk around down there."`
			`	"No, this area is mostly comprised of underbrush, if a fire starts here it has a high chance of taking out any specimens before we come back tomorrow," Richard objects. "Captain, let's just do this once more. You don't even need to leave the ship if you don't want to get wet. Just find a spot to land and we'll do the rest."`
			`	You agree to land, but find yourself unable to see anything in the middle of the cloud, and now the sun has gone dark for good. You boot up your ship's radar, seeing if it can map out the terrain, and notice a flat, tall area a bit to your right. Assuming it to be a plateau, you land there. A few seconds pass, and you hear snapping and cracking, and suddenly your ship takes a dive to the ground. It seems you had actually landed on top of some trees with a flat top. Thankfully, Oliver and Richard managed to hold onto their seats, and the shields absorbed the impact.`
			choice
				`	"Everyone stay calm, the ship's systems are fine, this won't compromise our movement."`
				`	"Another happy landing."`
			`	Although a bit shocked, Richard is rather euphoric, it seems your accidental crashlanding actually brought you closer to the exact spot he wanted to go to. He wants to go out immediately, but Oliver manages to convince him to stay in the ship, seeing as the lightning bolts have become far less frequent, and the rain is starting to get lighter. After about forty minutes, you three head out.`
			`	This time they triple check to see if they really cannot find any trace of the Calamagrostis lyonii once you reach the desired location, but once again, nothing is found. Richard yells, and finally agrees to go back to the ship and try again tomorrow. Or, at least, that was the intention. Right as you start heading back the rain comes back at full force, and you three hide inside a nearby cave. Inside, Richard starts looking for the plants, "just in case," he says.`
			`	You take to looking at the scenery, the few tall trees of this patch of the planet contrast with the vast rainforests you've been through today. As you move from one side of the cave's entrance to the other, some rain droplets almost seems to be stopped mid-air. Oliver comes after you, but stops midway, staring at the outside while crouched.`
				`	"What's wrong?"`
				`	"Did you find anything?"`
			`	He ignores you, and reaches out his hand forward, as if putting it behind something. You go behind him, and see that his hand has disappeared. Once he pulls it back closer to his body, it's there again. Almost like he put it inside some box painted to be exactly like the outside. He reaches out again, this time keeping his hand in place for about a minute, and suddenly it starts appearing out of thin air. He pulls back his arm once again, and the hand is still there.`
			`	"This is it! Grandpa, get back here!" He yells. They test time and time again, and conclude that it is indeed the lyonii, 'cloaked' to mimic the rainy area. With his machete, Richard carefully moves around to check for more, and after some time they see that there are a few dozen scattered by the side of the cave.`
			`	"We found them! Let's go outside right now and bring as many as we can inside the ship!" Richard says. You three leave and manage to locate the plants rather easily, as you can run your hand along the invisible trunk until you reach the closed flower buds, which have the rainbow colors on the inside. Oliver and Richard pick up a few, carefully unearthing the roots, and place them in some special pots they take out of their backpacks. The plant itself is about the size of a rabbit, if a bit bigger, with the flowers being just slightly larger than your palm, not counting your fingers.`
			`	"Fourteen of them, we brought fourteen of these vases that can simulate Amazon's soil, this way the plants won't die out," Oliver says.`
			`	"Captain, you were looking for a specimen of the Calamagrostis, correct? We'll let you keep one of these," Richard hands you one of the vases, giving a few general instructions on how to take care of it. "We need to get back to the spaceport now, I have to fill all sorts of documents and request some meetings with some researchers I know."`
			`	You help them bring the vases to your ship, and pilot it back to the docking area. They leave with their thirteen vases, after thanking you and wishing you the best. You're not sure for how the Calamagrostis lyonii can stay alive inside this vase, but you should probably take it to Ker'leri La'k as soon as possible.`

			`When you come back, the lines by one of the agencies seems to have dwindled down a lot, so you head there. When your turn comes, you barely mention the Araucaria and are directed outside. You try another one, and once again they ask you to leave. You try some more, but get the same result.`

Much like other species in the same situation, any specimens that do remain are now kept under close vigilance and very protected," they explain. "Look, I can't help you, Captain, but if you want to try your luck you could go there and try your luck," they show you to an old sign with some directions, pointing at some letters. 'HWOEHP', and head back to their work desk.`

			`	Before you can protest, the monitor cuts to an idle screen. The door to the waiting room is still closed, and you wouldn't want to cause any trouble on Earth, so you head back to your ship. You should probably stick around human space during this period, just in case.`

			`When you're coming down for a landing, three Lances approach your ship and communicate for you to follow them to the HWOEHP. Apparently you're not going to the one you found on the spaceport, but to another section of Earth entirely. If memory from your history books serves you right, you're probably entering the skies of South America, when a couple more Lances come in, and then later dozens of Combat Drones. You must be at the heart of where the Amazon rainforest was when you land.`
			`	Stepping off your ship, you're faced with a much shorter building than the spaceport one, only five stories tall, only this one covers a much larger, spread out square area, certainly over three city blocks on each side. You see multiple tree tops coming from what should be the roof of the whole place, only the parts that "stick out" are covered by a dome. When you're escorted inside you see that there are many doors leading to where they are coming from: many different open areas, with an absurd variety of herbs and general plant life inside each 'mini-park.' You also see some individuals in lab coats tending to some of the species there, some of them with almost an entire cargo crate of utensils by their side.`
			`	"Amused by our installations, <first> <last>?" A tall man in a traditional business suit says, coming down a staircase. "I am Zacharias Kyres, director of the HWOEHP. We are honored to have such a prestiged war hero as a visitor," he shakes hands with you, and becons you to follow him.`
			`	You walk into a room with some reporters and journalists, constantly taking pictures or filming you and Zacharias, who gives a short speech welcoming you, and then once again has you follow him, this time the paparazzi come too. You take multiple pictures near many different trees and bushes and flowers you had only seen in history and geography books, a big stage is set up near an Araucaria tree, in one of the open 'installations.' After all pictures have been taken, Zacharias once again gives a short speech to the journalists, and a "short period for questions" starts. It ends up lasting another hour and a half. Once all is done, and the reporters leave, finally you and two enter his office.`
			`	"Sorry about all of that, we just couldn't let this opportunity pass, a famous hero visiting our main facility and all, the extra attention this type of newsflash will definetly help bolster the government budget that comes our way, help us further protect these critically endangered species," he says, getting a cup of water from a machine on the wall.

			`	He puts the cup of water in front of you, then sits on his own chair, opposite to yours.`
			`	"Anyway, Captain. I imagine you don't want this day to be dragged any longer, after all that media coverage we just went through, so I'll be quick: why is it that you need an Araucaria seed?"`
			choice
				`	"It's complicated to explain everything, honestly."`
				`	"Can I please just get the seed? It's not like I'll be throwing it out of my cargo hold or something."`
			`	He gives you a stern look, then says, "You know, I'm one of the few people that get notified about a certain type of purchase in Alexandria, that of an advanced catalogue of all the known flora in human space. And I gotta say, the way you filled that formulary was... interesting, to say the least."`
			`	He opens a drawer, and pulls out some pictures, laying them on the table. Pictures of you, on the planets you visited to get the other plants.`
			`	"I asked everyone that works in this field all over to let me known if you passed by, and look what I found: Captain <last> on Pearl, buying some Textum viridis seeds, Captain <last> on Arabia, asking around about the Habenaria negundo, Captain <last> on Amazon, helping an old botanist find a dozen specimens of the Calamagrostis lyonii," he pauses, staring at you again.

			`	He seems unfazed by you saying that, as he leans back on his chair. "Go on," he says.`

You try to give him some context about their conflict with the Unfettered Hai -who he already knew existed, apparently- but he presses you to give more information about their work on restoring worlds and preserving ecosystems.`
			`	"So you don't know what type of technique they use to prepare the recently rejuvenated soil for some more demanding species of plants?" He asks.`
			`	"I haven't asked them the details of how they do their thing," you answer.`
			`	Zacharias gets up, grabs a calendar from a shelf, then looks back at you to say, "You said they're around north of Hai space? That should give a couple weeks for you to go there and come back here."`
			`	"Why would I have do that, exactly?"`
			`	"To ask them for permission, of course," he comes back to the desk. "I want to meet with these Wanderers. If I judge that they truly are as advanced at helping worlds flourish as you've led me to believe, I'll allow you to bring them an Araucaria seed."`
			`	"Can't you just come with me right now?"`
			`	"That'd make me an uninvited guest, now wouldn't it? Besides, I'll have to get a meeting with the government, explain everything. They'll probably want to send some of their own 'ambassators,' but I'll hopefully be able to discourage them. I trust to see you in a couple weeks, Captain."`
			`	You shake hands and you walk out of his office. Only then you realize how much attention you didn't pay when coming here in the first place. You can't recognize the hallways, and all the open areas with scientists tending to plants look the same, despite the obvious differences between the gardens' species.`
			`	"Captain <last>, take a left on the next hallway, then walk straight until you see an installation to your right with the Araucaria angustifolia, after that take a right and you'll reach the exit," a voice echoes in the hallway. Zacharias' voice. You look up and see tiny speakers in the corner of the hallway, along with a set of cameras.`
			`	Following the instructions, you reach the exit, and get back on your ship. Just like when you were coming in for a landing, when you launch several Combat Drones and Lances escort you to a certain point, after which you're on your own. You land back on one of the main docking areas.`

			`	Zacharias has been awfully quiet the entire trip, not even coming out of his bunk room. You follow him inside the building, where he takes you to what you think is around the center of the square-shaped complex. In front of a locked door, he presses both thumbs on some detectors, and bends his head slightly for some lights to meet his eyes. The doors open, and he gestures you to follow him inside.`
			`	You go down the steps of a spiral staircase, then walk along more hallways, now in the underground levels of the place. Unlike the ground floor, this one has several heavily armed guards patrolling the halls, and in front of all doors.`
			`	"You know, I was arrogant enough to think that I would be the one to ask those Wanderers questions, how they treat the soil, let me analyze it's composition, see how well maintained their preservation facilities were," he says, stopping in front of a large, double door. "Turns out I learned a lot more than I could hope to with questions. They're really something else, I guess once you've been taking care of planets and terraforming worlds to near perfection like they have, you just get that good."`
			`	Once again, he opens the door with the thumbs and eyes verifications. You two enter a massive storage room, reminiscent of a library, the 'rows' catalogued from left to right in alphabetical orders. Like in the halls, many guards are patrolling the inside of the room. Upon closer inspection, you see that the places where books would be, were this a library, there are small drawers, each with a different scientific name.`
			`	You two are in the middle of the rows, and walk left until reaching the letter A. There you start another mini search, until reaching the lowercase a. Even then, another mini-search starts, eventually you're looking at a drawer with 'Araucaria angustifolia' engraved on it.`
			`	To pull the drawer open, once again Zacharias verifies his identity via a retina check, with the light coming out of a little hole in between the words Araucaria and angustifolia. Finally, you hear several clicks, and he draws it open. Small ,transparent vase-like flasks are inside, three of which have one pinion seed each.`
			`	Zacharias waits about a minute, signaling for you to not reach for them yet. He grabs a small card from his pocket, and shows it in front of the same light as before. He then picks up one of the flasks, and hands it to you.`
			`	"They shouldn't be here, you know. Up where the Amazon used to be. These trees were native to a region farther south," he says. "Counting the one where we took that picture, there are seven Araucaria angustifolia trees left. All of them male. These are the last three seeds, I'm handing this one to those aliens with the hopes that they'll do a better job than us. Please keep it safe during the trip, Captain."`
			`	You follow him back to the upper levels of the complex. Before bidding you farewell, he calls some workers, and they bring a metal casing, where they put the flask. That casing is then further enveloped in a sturdy box, then a crate, and finally a container. They load it up on your ship, and as you leave, once again, your ship is escorted by Lances and Combat Drones.`

			`	The Wanderers take the container out of your ship, and open it, as well as the crate. The small box is not opened yet, they bring it to the same elevator as always, they must be planning to only expose the seed itself when it's in the safety of a laboratory.`

You can rest assured, I [vow, pledge] to make sure any and all [findings, discoveries] we make from studying these specimens will be shared with humanity, somehow I'll make it happen.
