# pilots-license

A small plug-in to implement the Pilot's License. All ships that used to not have a license restriction now require a Pilot's License to purchase them.

The outfit "Pilot's License" states: "Without a pilot's license, you cannot purchase a ship on a Republic planet." This plug-in implements that lore requirement in the game.
