			`You have been watching a particular Wardragon follow you in-atmosphere for some time, and feared the worst as it landed in a space directly adjacent to you. You disembark your ship, and wait a few tense moments...`
			`	Suddenly, uncountable numbers of Quarg burst off of the ship, and begin chasing you much faster than one would expect. They give you chase for around a minute before they have cornered you. One of them approaches and tackles you to the ground.`
			`	"Human. Thoust fickle license hath expired. You needst to see it repaired and renewed. Do not return to our worlds until you have thine issue fixed."`
			choice
				`	(Execute a karate move you saw in a movie once.)`
					goto karate
				`	"Okay, just get off of me!"`
			`	"Understood," the Quarg says, before standing up. "Do not forget to renew thoust license, <first> <last>." And with that, the hundreds of Quarg pile back onto the Wardragon and swiftly take off. As if it never happened.`

			`	You instinctively activate some miraculous group of muscles and suddenly you are on top of the Quarg, instead of the other way around. It makes a low groaning sound, which you would guess is a verbal indicator of pain or discomfort, before you turn your attention to the others.`
			`	Or, lack thereof. You catch a glimpse of a dozen or so making their way hurriedly back onto the Wardragon. And around you are several dozen bloody, lifeless Quarg bodies. You look down at your hands and realize they're soaked in Quarg blood. Then you notice the Quarg beneath you isn't actually the Quarg who was pinning you to the ground.`
			`	What... happened? You step off of the Quarg and watch it flee into oblivion, before turning to the spaceport. You think you need a little time to relax...`

			`As you are landing, you catch sight of a very curious and relatively excited Korath waving to your ship. When you open your ship's hatch, it walks right up the ramp to greet you! It is a lot shorter than most Korath, and its scales are brighter and more vibrant than most. In short, they appear to be a child.`
			`	It raises its palms to you, before retrieving a small slip of paper. It bounces up and down on its feet as it hands you the slip. As you're unfolding the paper, the Korath scampers down your ship's ramp, and the crowd slowly disperses.`
			choice
				`	(Inspect the Korath child's paper.)`
				`	(Ignore the paper.)`
					goto ignore
			`	The paper is barely legible, and was most likely written by the Korath that handed it to you, based on its reaction. It reads, "Dear Captain <last>, I noticed your ship license was expired!! :( So I think you should get it renewed! :)"`
			`	An odd change of pace from the Korath. You wonder how it learned to write in your language at all.`
				accept
			label ignore
			`	You shrug it off and pocket the paper, continuing down the ramp. Whoever the child was, they're too shy or embarrassed to approach you again, for the rest of your stay on the planet was uninterrupted.`

			`You barely enter radio range before your ship receives various warnings and notices. A very grainy, synthesized voice blares over your ship speakers, "Warning <last>. Your ship license appears to be expired. This is unacceptable, and we cannot interact with you until it has been renewed. Have a good day.`
			`	Despite the warning, no Mereti ships appear to stop you from landing, or interacting. In fact, they largely ignore you, more interested in maintaining the war effort against the Kor Sestor than reinforcing their word.`
			`	Perhaps it was the Mereti's botched attempt at sarcasm, or a joke?`
