# Made by Azure Nyoki
# You're free to modify the code below as you see fit.
# Spacetime Ripper Warhead is obtainable in trinket and world forge. Price is low, because this is for fun
# Changelog:
#	v1:
#		- initial release. buggy.
#	v2:
#		-added a changelog, yay!
#		-can now target "friendlies", like archons
#		-buffed gravitational pull
#		-added a marker for the blast radius to give the player a precise distance to get away from. 
#		-added repulsive fields to prevent ships from triggering the explosion too early and making the weapon fail.
#		-decreased initial velocity. now behaves more like a mine and less like a gun.
#		-increased delay for blackhole spawning, to give the player a chance to escape in light of the new changes.
#		-added ammo requirements, and huge costs.
