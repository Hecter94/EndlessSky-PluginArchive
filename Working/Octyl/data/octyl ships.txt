	description "This miniscule new-age Octyl vessel was designed with every scenario in mind. While the Kaurna carries a modest armament and decently-sized propulsion for combat situations, it also has a spacious cargo capacity and two additional bunks for more diplomatic events. The shields, however, are somewhat diminutive, given how new of a concept they are to the Octyl."
