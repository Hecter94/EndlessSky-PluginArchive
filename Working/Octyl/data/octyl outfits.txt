	description "This prototype shield system produces a modest shield matrix which encases many new-age Octyl ships, and has the capability of regenerating such a matrix should trauma cause it to dispel. This concept has already been captured by most other races, though only the Octyl have such a device to increase one's native shield matrix."

	description "This syringe gun contains the potent venom of the Octyl, enough to paralyze a grown man for several hours, and kill small children. It is not a very effective offensive weapon, however, and serves best as a defensive measure."
	description "Even a small drop of the venom is capable of fueling this weapon for thousands of uses. However, restocking is a difficult process, involving extracting the substance from its natural environment, or purchasing it from a willing subject."
