			`	"A great service," the Saryd starts, "we require of you. The first human in Coalition space, you are, and our most recent alien encounter, you have become."`
			`	"Like family, the three races of the coalition have become," explains the Kimek. "Forgotten how to negotiate well, we have, and comfortable with our friendship we have grown."`

			`	"How strong they are, we do not know," the Arachi admits solemnly, "With force rivaling the Quarg, they might be able to attack. We do not know. Which is why you, to help us, we ask."`
			`	After a moment of silence, the Saryd asks, "To ask us, do you have anything else, human <last>?"`

			`	After a longer and more tense silence, the Saryd explained, "Uncertain, we are. Emotional and afraid, we are."`
			`	"What to do, we know not," adds the Kimek, "How this will play out, we must wait to see."`

			`	"If they are aggressive and do not want to negotiate," adds the Kimek, "we attack and push them out. If they do not respond to hails, we will explore their giant ship in search of them."`
			`	"If to assist us you wish not, leave you may." says the Arachi, "But if to assist us you wish, meet us the Heliarch again in the spaceport."`

			`You spend some time idling near the docking bays of the Ring of Friendship, waiting for Heliarch agents to instruct you further. While waiting, you notice the activity on the ring world had picked up considerably. Double, perhaps triple the activity you're used to seeing.`
			`	On top of the increased activity, the atmosphere seems more tense than usual. Groups of Heliarch agents rushing to and from ships, tending to the ringworld, preparing their warships. Wide-eyed, you watch a large group of Heliarchs ferry shipments of Quarg equipment, and install them onto veteran-looking Punishers.`
			`	After watching the first Skylance being installed, a triplet of the Heliarch approach you. "Captain <last>, you are?" asks the Saryd, "Weapons, you have? Assistance, we may need."`

			`	"So much power, the Quarg Skylances use," pipes in an Arachi, "Batteries, we must rely on. Enough power, our reactors cannot provide. But in bursts, if we fire, just as strong the weapons remain."`

			`As you guide the fleet of warships to a modest hangar on the Ring of Power, you watch swarms of Heliarch agents pour in to inspect the vessels. It seems bringing their defense fleets into action was a lot more difficult and nerve-wracking than much of the Heliarch had anticipated.`
			`	Then, you turn around and see many, many more pouring in from the skies. You try to keep track, but you lose count some time after the fifth Punisher flies in for landing. After several minutes of waiting through standard safety procedures, a trio of Heliarch agents confront you.`
			`	"To Lone Cloud, we have pinpointed our visitors," explains the Saryd, "To Lone Cloud, we shall fly. A fight, you should expect, <last>."`
			`	"What they may do, we know not," says the Kimek.`

				`	"If we talk to them, whatever they are, maybe we don't have to fight."`

			`You and the remaining Heliarch ships zero in on a particularly large and conveniently flat iceberg to land on, instead of moving out of your way to find the more common spaceport. The iceberg rocks with each ship's landing, and sinks a concerning amount into the tropical waters around you.`
			`	The crew of the ships convene near the center of the iceberg, discussing various topics to maintain morale. It doesn't take long for an Arach to approach you and begin conversation. They explain how these icebergs house unique biospheres unlike anything found across Coalition space, due to its unique situation. "Temporary, the entire system is. Melt and become one with the oceans, this iceberg will soon, as before countless others have." The quirky nature of Heliarch translators makes the scientist very difficult to follow.`

They explain ways to discern a predatory, herbivorous, and parasitic organisms apart, how to identify likely edible substances, and what classification systems the Coalition use to categorize organisms across their section of the galaxy. Unfortunately, the translator inhibits your understanding of the subject for some time, though the Arach doesn't seem to mind explaining concepts to you in simpler terms.`
			`	Out of seemingly nowhere, the Arach looks up at you and stutters, (though the translator seems indifferent to the tonal change,) "Sorry, I am. Introductions I have neglected." They shuffle around for a moment before continuing slowly, "Mutug I am known. Have a name, do you?`
			`	"<first> <last>," you reply, "Nice to meet you, Mutug."`
			`	"Same to you, <first>! A pleasure it was with you to speak with." With the introductions now out of the way, the Arach launches back into an explanation. By the time they feel satisfied with your knowledge of the surrounding biosphere, Vibrant Water's sun is nearly setting.`
