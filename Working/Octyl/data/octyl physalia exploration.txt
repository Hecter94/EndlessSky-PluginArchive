conversation "physalia exploration"
	`You and a small fleet of Heliarch ships locate what one may call a "spaceport" on the planetoid below. You're surprised by the blip on your screen, indicating antigravity engines can be engaged.`
	`	One by one, your ships land in the eerily-quiet "spaceport", and gather at the center. An Arach chitters nervously, firing several shots into the darkness.`
	`	"Something, I saw, moving," it chitters apologetically, "alone, we are not!" Silence accompanies the Arach's nervous speech, which doesn't seem to calm it down in the slightest.`
	`	A Saryd drops a metal cube onto the ground, and its panels open to reveal a light source. Much of the spaceport is illuminated, though it also illuminates the many branching tunnels leading away from the spaceport.`
	`	"A prototype light, it is," explains the Saryd, "Follow us, it can to anywhere." To demonstrate, the Saryd trots around the group, and the light's panels split into several spider-like appendages, allowing it to scuttle across the floor to the Saryd.`
	`	Several of the other Heliarch members applaud lightly, and the Saryd tenderly picks the light off the ground, "Or a held source of light it can be." The light's appendages snap together to form a grip for the Saryd, and it wields the light like a torch. The Saryd places the light on the ground and looks to you, "The light, do you like it?"`

		`	"That is an impressive gadget you've made."`
		`	"Could I keep one of those for personal use?"`
			goto personal
	`	"Yes, but some unfortunate glitches it is known to experience," interjects a Kimek, "Slippery surfaces it cannot climb, pathfinding it struggles with."`
	`	To demonstrate, the Kimek steps behind an Arach. It leaps into action, scuttling towards the Kimek, before slamming into one of the Arach's legs and tumbling onto its side. Its legs flail helplessly in a futile attempt to right itself.`

	`	"Play with it, please," offers the Arach, picking it up, "To understand its actions. To learn its behavior."`
	`	"You it will study and mimic," a Kimek interjects, "Like a pet you it will learn to follow and look up to."`

	`[Board the physalia with a dozen researchers. Apparently, more ships will arrive as time goes on, with more specially-trained expedition teams. Expound on what those teams usually do?]`
	`	[Discuss how best to explore the thing, as there are winding corridors instead of any open spaces to make mapping the landscape easy. It could barely even be described as landscape, it's obvious this has been artificially converted to most effectively service whoever used it.]`

		`	[All 12 people split up to cover maximum ground.]`
	`	[Reaction to splitting up fully. Bad idea, and cursory sonar scans reveal the structure is like a labyrinth all the way through, with no rhyme or reason.]`
	`	[Further discussion, then some strange noise which spooks much of the group. Did we mention there are no lights at all?]`
