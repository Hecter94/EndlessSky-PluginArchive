	description "This is one of the more recent developments by the Octyl, who are now inundated with energy. While the Ion Beam is frighteningly power-hungry, especially for a species that was on the brink of starvation, their powerful solar panels coupled with their clever battery technology should be able to hold several of these powered simultaneously."

	description "The Grapple Beam is an experimental new technology utilizing the now-inundating abundance of energy the Octyl have found themselves immersed with. By packing a tight beam with as much power as possible, it can briefly and very violently magnetize the hull of its target, pulling itself and the target closer together."

	description "The Pulsator Turret is an attempt by the Octyl to make a standard energy weapon, one focused on damaging as opposed to pulling or electrifying the target. The result has a bit of kick to it, and is very energy-hungry compared to energy weapons you're used to, but it definitely gets the job done."
