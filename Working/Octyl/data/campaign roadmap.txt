# This is a roadmap which will be removed once the plugin is completed.
# Perhaps it will be kept for archival purposes, but it will be completely
# unnecessary for the function of the plugin itself.
# 
# 
# So, what's happened so far (as of creating this file):
# 
# Octyl arrive in Coalition space
# heliarch call player to check them out
# fend off a wave of Nautilus ships
# wait around 2-4 months before called back
# a planetoid has appeared in Coalition space
# disable it and either explore it or leave it be
# 
# 
# What is planned to happen: (in no concrete order)
# encounter a captured Octyl with low stakes (after nautilus attack), (like a vaccine)
# encounter an Octyl on the physalia, much higher stakes, maybe capture it, maybe die, maybe nothing much
# 
# coalition extremists react to Octyl arrival by allying and/or rebelling
# maybe reveal another race the extremists have been keeping a secret?
# maybe said race appears at a similar time to the Octyl showing up?
# 
# butterfly aliens and six-limbed bat people, so the coalition has 6 many-legged aliens all allied
