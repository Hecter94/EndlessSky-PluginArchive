# Omnis
This project persists as the most extensive all-content plugin to date! From installation, there will be a new wormhole in Rutilicus and additional wormholes in each species' capital system all leading the player to the Omnis galaxy. Omnis is represented as a miniaturized copy of the Milky Way galaxy with specialized all-content systems for each of the game species.
Additional features:
- Near unlimited credits are given to the player
- Ability to change the players' swizzle to any of the supported 29 ship overlays
- Automatic mapping of all vanilla systems and wormholes
- Arena to challenge a representative ship of any vanilla species
- Invulnerable developer ship and outfits capable of exploring the map of the game with ease

### In addition to all the helpful tools for vanilla use, Omnis supports many community plugins:
## Supported

[Aben](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/Aben):
Beyond the reaches of ordinary space-faring civilizations lies the cluster of systems afforded to the Aben, though they have yet to lay claim to the greater selection of worlds available to them. Impressive technological advancement contrasts the clear non-expansionist nature of the Aben, they believe in cooperation between all life and rarely show signs of hostility.

[Altera](https://github.com/EricD112/Altera):
Adds a new civilization to the Ember Wastes: Alterans. Alterans, like Heliarchs, are a Tier 2.5 civilization in the Endless Sky universe. In total, there are about 80 systems related to Alteran territory.

[Beccas-Endless-Expansion](https://github.com/beccabunny/Beccas-Endless-Expansion):
New weapons, outfits and ships for many factions of the game Endless Sky, all with new sprites close to the vanilla ones! All you have to do is explore, fly in your ship and meet all the factions in the game

[Beyond-the-Sky](https://github.com/1010todd/Beyond-the-Sky):
This plugin adds more advanced warships for Quarg and Pug and make them adjust their force to match you.

[cognitive-subdivision](https://github.com/professorlust/cognitive-subdivision):
Cognitive Subdivision introduces a new difficult story taking place after the first part of the Wanderer Campaign
as well as several new maps, 2 new tier 3 factions with various unique outfits and ships of their own for you to unlock
...and some suprises for you to find!

[Core-Mining-Inc](https://github.com/DJF113/Core-Mining-Inc):
The Core Mining, Inc. plugin gives you the chance to follow the progress of a small startup mining company. The storyline is designed to fit in with the feel of the vanilla game. The story and plugin itself is not finished yet so you may find bugs, glitches, and other problems. If you find any problems or have suggestions, please contact me through the ModDB page, or on GitHub.

[Czartraks-Ship-Pack](https://github.com/czartrak/Czartraks-Ship-Pack):
This mod adds various new ships to Endless Sky.

[derogam](https://github.com/Lorantine/derogam):
A big WIP project of dragon aliens with their own ships, outfits, storyline, jobs and whatnot. Base game quality is the aim and merging it is the idea, so ships, outfits etc. that are done may be improved anytime. When is it done? When there's nothing to add anymore, and judged by my work speed, never. Even after a storyline there may be side stories to make, ships to add, outfits to make, maintenance to do etc.

[Endless-Sky-40K](https://github.com/1010todd/Endless-Sky-40K):
Endless Sky 40K plugin adds ships and outfits from Warhammer 40k to Endless Sky!

[Eternals](https://github.com/comnom/Eternals):
This plugin introduces two new factions northeast of Unfettered Hai territory. Each faction has their own unique ships and share a set of outfits. This is a work in progress, so check the website for updates!

[Fallen](https://www.moddb.com/mods/galactic-conquest):
This mod starts you on an ancient space station that was built by a fallen alien empire. You are the last member of this alien species, and the AI that awoke you has informed you that you have been tasked with reconquering the galaxy. It's a good thing the station you're on doubles as a ship construction yard.

[galactic-couriers](https://github.com/Derekcz/galactic-couriers):
A minor side-story taking place mostly in an isolated star system outside of the human space.
Main game story must be completed before this plugin's story can fully start.

[Human-Fluff](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/Human-Fluff)

[Irm](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/Irm):
A harrowed cluster of once great potential sits as the eternal reminder of the atrocities of the Hai empire.

[Lost-in-Midnight](https://github.com/MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight):

Expand your pirate experience with new ships, outfits, systems and even mechanics! This plugin expands the northern pirate section to a large area, big enough to allow trading or similar activities one could do in the rest of the galaxy. Two new pirate ships are added, a freighter that is by itself capable of jamming the nearby sensors and a middle ground between the Firebird and the Leviathan. Finally, 6 new outfits are added, including two turrets and one special outfit that comes with a special mechanic that is obtainable using a lot of invisible missions.

[Pug-Defense](https://github.com/Wyrdean/Pug-Defense):
Pug Defense is a small but extremely challenging plugin which adds a system to the south of the galaxy, accessible only by jump drive. In the system, corrupted pug fleets will spawn, extremely hostile and after your blood, however, should you be strong enough, you can challenge the planets and demand tribute. The defenders are like nothing you've ever seen before, including the peak of Pug technology, the Pug Perfecta.

[Quarg-Fluff](https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods/Quarg-Fluff)
