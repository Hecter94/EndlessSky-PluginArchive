### Welcome to Omnis!
Omnis has risen to be the #1 all-content plugin in the community, though competition is still encouraged as only from different perspectives can the best iteration of this niche be reached. Omnis was released after [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge) but before [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo), and good faith was practiced by all competing authors.

In order of release, known competitors have been:
- [All Content Plugin](https://github.com/endless-sky/all-content-plugin)
- [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge)
- [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo)
- [Ruin the Fun](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun)

### What to expect
There is no need to worry about breaking existing saves when installing, you will be presented with a warning that lets you choose what level of involvement you want that save to have with Omnis. To avoid any interaction, there's an option to abort which will kill the player and disallow saving the interaction.

So how do you use this plugin? Well there are two very simple methods of [accessing Omnis](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/-Omnis/wiki/Access). 
There is a wormhole in each of the major factions' systems to travel there, and there is a custom start that can be chosen when making a new pilot.

> [!WARNING]
> The Omnis custom start will begin your pilot with an impossibly high credit value and brand your save with the Omnis start.
