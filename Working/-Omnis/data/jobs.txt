			`Omnis is the leading all-content plugin within the Endless Sky community. If you're having trouble navigating it then you're in the right place, through this job I'll try to help you understand the various features of Omnis!`
			`	First of all, you're here because you have either found the wormhole that leads you here, or you've picked the Omnis start when making a new save. Welcome to the one stop shop for all you would need from an all-content plugin.`

			`	Omnis features a complete arena to make fighting ships simple, you can select any ship found in the systems rings to fight the represented ship one on one. This implementation aims to assist in testing ship loadouts against existing ships for balancing purposes.`
			`	Each faction or plugin system contains an arena of their own featuring a complement of ships to fight relevant to the faction or plugin.`
				goto "help"
			label "factions"
			`	The vanilla game files seperate faction specific content into named folders, this is where Omnis directly takes note of which factions to represent. Factions are represented by their own systems within the Omnis galaxy featuring sales filtered to their technology and whatever else is sold directly by them.`
			`	Each system features its' own arena for fighting ships which are again, filtered by the faction.`
				goto "help"
			label "support"
			`	Community plugins can define their own systems found within Omnis to contain anything they want, but it is suggested they mimic the style shown off in the mainline Omnis. Plugin support is not the responsibility of this plugin but accomodations are made to streamline the process.`
			`	While not the primary focus of Omnis, bringing the community together to maintain a cohesive experience for new players is just as important, it is recommended that you make use of the provided tools to better balance ships and outfits within the style of the game.`
			`	If you or someone you know is the author of a plugin and would need help representing it within Omnis, you can refer to other active Adde plugins (https://github.com/Adde-Endless-Sky-Mods) to see how they manage it, or you can ask Darcy Manoel in the discord.`

			`	Your reputation with the factions of the game can be irreversibly damaged by your actions, for this reason, a job is provided to reset the players reputation with all the factions of the vanilla game.`
			`	A swizzle job allows the player to choose any of 29 swizzles to change the appearance of the players' ships. Most options are minor or major color changes, while some offer swizzles that are more than simple repaintings.`
			`	While Omnis offers all the content you would need, it does not give you access to ship variants by default. You can toggle if you want variants to be sold at sales via the job board.`
