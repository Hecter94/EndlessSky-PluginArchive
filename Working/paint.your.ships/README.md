### paint.your.ships
<br>
<br>
Offers a job on Earth to paint your ships.<br>
<br>
There are already like five plugins that change the swizzle color, but this one has the colors displayed ingame (image by amazinite). If the plugin control.station is installed, the job changes from Earth to that station.<br>
