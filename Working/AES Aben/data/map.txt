planet "Nis"
	landscape land/forest0
	description `Eerily, there are no winged creatures amongst the skies and few land roaming animals. Those animals that do walk the land however are large, lumbering beasts that easily dwarf small buildings. The most dominant species is noticeably creatures resembling old earth humans, they boast a very large build and move cautiously in groups.`
	description `These humanesque creatures appear to have received aid as their technology is far beyond what they might have achieved otherwise. They prove quite formidable in the field of infrastructural and agricultural planning, perhaps they have been aided in that respect also, the various towns and villages appear to have stood for many centuries.`
	spaceport `The spaceport, located in the very center of a deep crater, shoots out of the ground like a glimmering silver spire. Surrounding the spire are densely populated residential and industrial sectors. The lower airspace of the city and lower levels of the spire are utilized for use by some form of flight capable vehicle, presumably for transit for the wealthy.`
	spaceport `It appears as though only the very top regions of the spire are intended for foreigners to land, however there are docking bays located at various points around each docking level. Apparently only the most fortunate of Aben ever make it to the top of the spire, it's regarded as the highest honor to be of the few individuals to greet visiting species.`
	
planet "Pesek"
	landscape land/mountain2
	description `A lifeless rock with a very thin atmosphere, slightly smaller than the Aben homeworld Nis. Somehow the Aben have managed to travel and colonise here, how they hold the power of spaceflight at their stage of evolution is astounding, even with the advanced technology they have been provided.`
	description `The colonies sole purpose on this planet appears to be the research and development of the advanced technology they are given. With many flashes of light and booming sounds from off-site locations along the planets surface, the feel for the intensity of research is very intense.`
	spaceport `The spaceport contains all of two landing pads, if it can even be called that, there is no area for pilots to gather and no shops in the local area, this is clearly meant only for supply deliveries to the colony.`
	spaceport `A looped broadcast confirms that the facility is not open to visitors, there is nothing to be done here but wait and refuel.`
