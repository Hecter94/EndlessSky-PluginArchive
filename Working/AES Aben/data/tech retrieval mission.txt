Is there anything we are able to assist you with today?", you explain that you have some technology for offer and he motions to the engineers, while the rest carry on refueling your ship one walks up to Saed.`
			`	Saed explains the situation to the engineer and he walks on back to his team which are now done refueling to explain to them the situation. They all walk on back and you guide them to your cargo hold to unload the modules. While they are working to unload them, Saed strikes up conversation on these 'regenerators' and you do your best to explain that they seem to work so effectively by overcharging the matrix, but this consumes much more energy than any other shield regenerator of its size.`
			`	After the engineers unload the shields, they run multiple scans on both pieces and begin to examine them as best they could without disassembling them. One of them makes their way to Saed after some time and says something to him that you can't understand. "Taking into account everything you have told us, and what we have found by examining it, we can offer you 2608000 credits, is this an acceptable offer?"`
