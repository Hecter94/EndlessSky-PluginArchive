conversation "atlantean start"
	scene "scene/lobby"
	`You step out of the elevator in the bank, and walk forwards to the high desk. In the background, a map of Atlantean space is projected on the wall, complete with trade prices and olin jump fleets. As you step forwards, the bank teller looks at you as if he's trying to decide to give you a loan or not. He tells you, "Sign here. And here, and here," until you are buried in a pile of papers. Then he re-asks you, "Are you sure? I remind you this is a non-returnable loan."`
	choice
		`	"Yes, I'm sure."`
	`	He says "Very well, re-sign your name here." and points.`
	name
	`	You step backwards, out of the room, and sigh with relief that this went smoothly, instead of the bank teller refusing to give you a loan.`
