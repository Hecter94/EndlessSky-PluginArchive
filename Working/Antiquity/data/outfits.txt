This particularly ancient model of beam weapons energizes the beam much more than the modern variant, which causes it to practically slice through shields like they're nothing, but it has a reduced effect on hull."

	description `This antique missile launcher is so old, the missiles fire one at a time instead of in clusters like most other missile launchers do. This is because it predates the anti-missile turrets invented by Lovelace labs, so there was no need to "overwhelm" any systems when attacking.`
	description `Also, due to the lack of anti-missile systems to discourage this behavior, the missile launcher packs a lot of explosive into one structure, and not a lot of protective shell, meaning it is much weaker than any modern missile systems.`
