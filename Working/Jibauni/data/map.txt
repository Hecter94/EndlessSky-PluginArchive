	attributes jibauni uninhabited
	landscape land/water27
	description `This is a beautiful world, with rushing rivers and great trees. No other ships, hostile or friendly, seem to be here.`
	description `	The wildlife on Owiay is abundant, and there do not seem to be predators. All animals you see eat nothing but leaves.`
	description `	In addition, there are plant-eating dinosaurs roaming the green hillsides. The Jibauni transplanted them here from Baitoon when they first discovered spaceflight.`

planet Taltahard
	attributes jibauni moon
	landscape land/mining1
	description `This small moon is much like many other moons, except for one thing-it has very good iron ore. This moon also has large reserves of deuterium, used to make hyperspace fuel. The one problem is there are few to no areas suitable for farming, and so food comes at a premium here.`
	description `	This system was the last of the five to be discovered. A captain on Landalmon had sensed it, with the rudimentary technology the Jibauni had. However, it was a captain on Baitoon who first jumped into it, and so he has the credit.`
	spaceport `There are few places in Jibauni space you have seen that have so many Nathars and Nathases around, and there are few passenger transports evident. Many large landing pads dot the site, and the main amenity is the fuel-which happens to be self-serve.`

	spaceport `When coming down for landing, most of what can be seen is rock, though ships above the city see nothing but planets and trees, due to the haphazard nature of the Rebels that terraformed this planet. However, once down, the streets are wide and cool, with luxurious buildings and shady pathways.`
	spaceport `	This was built by Reshi, a Jibauni who spearheaded the Rebel movement. She still lives and fights today.`

	description `That this is the place where the Rebels have their government is easy to see, because there are many fortified buildings and bunkers in readiness to shoot any invaders, and the many planetary defenses are very powerful.`
	description `	The credit for discovering this planet goes to Wahlkin, a Jibauni who had once been a peaceful planet-dweller. Eventually, however, he started exploring, and subsequently started the colony of Andwerfen, which grew into the planet it is today.`
	description `	Many Jibauni wish that Andwerfen had never been founded.`
	spaceport `Little is here except for the many armed patrols the Rebel Jibauni keep patrolling the neighborhoods, looking for disruptors of the peace. The Jibauni around you all look frightened, and the number here that must wish to get back to normal Jibauni space must be large.`
