planet Owiay
	attributes jibauni uninhabited
	landscape land/water27
	description `This is a beautiful world, with rushing rivers and great trees. No other ships, hostile or friendly, seem to be here.`
	description `	The wildlife on Owiay is abundant, and there do not seem to be predators. All animals you see eat nothing but leaves.`

planet Taltahard
	attributes jibauni moon
	landscape land/mining1
	description `This small moon is much like many other moons, except for one thing-it has very good iron ore. This moon also has large reserves of deuterium, used to make hyperspace fuel. The one problem is there are few to no areas suitable for farming, and so food comes at a premium here.`
	description `	This system was the last of the five to be discovered. A captain on Landalmon had sensed it, with the rudimentary technology the Jibauni had. However, it was a captain on Baitoon who first jumped into it, and so he has the credit.`
	spaceport `There are few places in Jibauni space you have seen that have so many Nathars and Nathases around, and there are few passenger transports evident. Many large landing pads dot the site, and the main amenity is the fuel-which happens to be self-serve.`

	description `This station is uninhabited, but there is an eerie feeling about it, as if there was a reason it was abandoned. But it seems to be in fully functional condition and apparently only needs a few hard workers to put it right and make it livable.`
	description `	It was built by the Sheragi long ago, before the Jibauni drove them out of Lalin. The Sheragi presence is still evident, however, because of the hugeness of the station. It is rather spooky.`

		description `Not many people or Jibauni are here. Just a sad stillness and a huge emptiness. However, a few Rebels and Normals roam the passageways in peace, because this is important to them.`

	description `	This station was built fairly recently, only one hundred years ago. The company which built it, though, Dertoy Enterprises, has gone out of business, and most Jibauni think that the station has been there since the beginning-the same way the Station of Power has been.`
	spaceport `Quite a few Jibauni are walking around, many with black robes. There also many of the Jibauni who wear the uniforms which here are the mark of being a spaceport employee. There are many ships nearby, and many Jibauni unloading and reloading all aspects of them.`

There also are many religious buildings and none of the pubs and bars expected on a normal planet. Billboards are posted everywhere advertising something impossible to read.`

	spaceport `The spaceport here has many ships landing and taking off. But there are not many cargo handling facilities, and only a few ships look as if they were built for carrying cargo, while the number of passenger transports is great. Many Jibauni are in the bustle of security and luggage scanning that is common to most of their worlds. There is only one city; all the rest of the planet seems untouched by the Jibauni.`

Thus, the Jibauni are very careful not to let Rebel agents land on this planet, because if someone working for the other side gets in, it could be disastrous.`
	description `	This planet is in the first system discovered by the Jibauni. The official story was that government ships found it after long periods of trying to make hyperdrives, but common belief says that a captain named Rindil Jibson discovered it just a few hundred years after the Jibauni started.`

	description `	The credit for discovering this planet goes to Wahlkin, a Jibauni who had been a peaceful planet-dweller until the Sheragi came. When the war was over, he started exploring, and subsequently started the colony of Andwerfen, which grew into the planet it is today.`
	description `	Many Jibauni wish that Andwerfen had never been founded.`
	spaceport `Little is here except for the many armed patrols the Rebel Jibauni keep patrolling the neighborhoods, looking for disruptors of the peace. The Jibauni around you all look frightened, and the number here that must wish to get back to normal Jibauni space must be large.`

	spaceport `The small amount of things to do here all have to do with the immense amount of trading this planet is involved in. Few buildings dot the site, but many things like sheepfolds are scattered everywhere. There are also many weird silos and grain bins.`
