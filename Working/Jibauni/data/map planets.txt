	landscape land/rocks1
	description `That this is the place where the Rebels have their government is easy to see, because there are many fortified buildings and bunkers in readiness to shoot any invaders, and the many planetary defenses are very powerful.`
	description `	The credit for discovering this planet goes to Wahlkin, a Jibauni who had once been a peaceful planet-dweller. Eventually, however, he started exploring, and subsequently started the colony of Andwerfen, which grew into the planet it is today.`
	description `	Many Jibauni wish that Andwerfen had never been founded.`
	spaceport `Little is here except for the many armed patrols the Rebel Jibauni keep patrolling the neighborhoods, looking for disruptors of the peace. The Jibauni around you all look frightened, and the number here that must wish to get back to normal Jibauni space must be large.`

	description `This is where the Jibauni started, and presumably where the seat of the Normal Jibauni government is. Many Jibauni are moving about in the long, narrow passageways between the landing pads, many of which are old and cracked.`
	description `	There used to be other dinosaurs on this planet, but the Jibauni have transplanted them to a different planet, Owiay, where they thrive much better.`

	spaceport `This is the oldest existing spaceport in Jibauni space, and has many different sizes of hangars and pads to compensate for the large amounts of traffic this planet gets, because it is the third tourist destination in all of Jibauni space. All the buildings here are also old, and many of them are small and close together.`

	description `This is the farming world that feeds Jibauni space. No other planet produces as much food as this one, and the crops that grow well here just so happen to be the ones that are best for Jibauni growth. Thus, the Jibauni are very careful not to let Rebel agents land on this planet, because if someone working for the other side gets in, it could be disastrous.`
	description `	This planet is in the first system discovered by the Jibauni. The official story was that government ships found it after long periods of trying to make hyperdrives, but common belief says that a captain named Rindil Jibson discovered it just a few hundred years after the Jibauni started.`
	spaceport `There is not much here in the way of servicing passengers. A few immigrants are scattered about to get checked through, but most of the facilities of this spaceport are for cargo. The area outside the spaceport is immense, and filled with plant colors of all kinds.`

	description `	This station was built fairly recently, only one hundred years ago. The company which built it, though, Dertoy Enterprises, has gone out of business, and most Jibauni think that the station has been there since the beginning.`
	spaceport `Quite a few Jibauni are walking around, many with black robes. There also many of the Jibauni who wear the uniforms which here are the mark of being a spaceport employee. There are many ships nearby, and many Jibauni unloading and reloading all aspects of them.`

There also are many religious buildings and none of the pubs and bars expected on a normal planet. Billboards are posted everywhere advertising something impossible to read.`
	description `	This is the planet of the gods to the Jibauni. Their ancient legends tell of a place where the rulers of the universe lived, and where all was quiet and peaceful.`
	description `	This, they believe, is that planet, and so have been very careful not to spoil it.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here has many ships landing and taking off. But there are not many cargo handling facilities, and only a few ships look as if they were built for carrying cargo, while the number of passenger transports is great. Many Jibauni are in the bustle of security and luggage scanning that is common to most of their worlds. There is only one city; all the rest of the planet seems untouched by the Jibauni.`

	description ``
	description `	This planet is also a mining planet, so the rock has great scars in it at places and there are many machines to do the digging, which are scattered around parked looking very untidy.`
	spaceport `When coming down for landing, most of what can be seen is rock, though ships above the city see nothing but planets and trees, due to the haphazard nature of the Rebels that terraformed this planet. However, once down, the streets are wide and cool, with luxurious buildings and shady pathways.`

There are also many oceans on this planet.`
	description `	The ground also shivers and quakes, and there are great cranes and craters scattered across the surface.`
	spaceport `The facilities of all kinds here are quite large, this planet having one of the best of the Jibauni spaceports. Rumor has it that there are secret passageways all over underneath the spaceport, and that in fact the whole spaceport is a cover for something far bigger that the Rebel Jibauni are building.`

But the animals here do not like light, and so there are artificial shades over a good portion of the planet, though the top of them has been very cleverly painted to look like the surface of the planet beneath.`
	spaceport `Many animals and barrels, baskets, and buckets of food are here at the market, and the price of Food here is astoundingly low. Clothing is also very cheap and plentiful here. However, noticing that the traders for Luxury Goods and Heavy metals are few and far between is easy, and they do not seem to be getting very much business.`

	description `	This system was the last of the five to be discovered. A captain on Landalmon had sensed it, with the rudimentary technology the Jibauni had. However, it was a captain on Baitoon who first jumped into it, and so he has the credit.`
	spaceport `There are few places in Jibauni space you have seen that have so many Nathars and Nathases around, and there are few passenger transports evident. Many large landing pads dot the site, and the main amenity is the fuel-which happens to be self-serve.`
