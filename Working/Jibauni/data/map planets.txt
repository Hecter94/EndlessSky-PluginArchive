planet Andwerfen

	landscape land/andwerfen
	description `Obviously, Andwerfen is occupied by the Rebel Jibauni government. Fortified buildings and bunkers dot the whole city, in readiness to shoot invaders, and planetary defenses jut out of the landscape everywhere - even on the tops of buildings.`
	description `	Wahlkin, a Jibauni once a peaceful planet-dweller, was inspired by stories of new spacecraft and heroic feats of flight. Eventually he started exploring, and subsequently started the colony of Andwerfen, now grown into a full-fledged military academy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is filled by armed patrols keeping an eye out for any sign of rebellion. Every Jibauni you see wears a frightened expression, and many wish to escape back to normal Jibauni space.`

	description `	Other dinosaurs used to live on this planet, but the Jibauni have transplanted them to a different planet, Owiay, where they thrive and grow much better then they would in a land of T. Rexes.`

	description `	This planet is in the first system discovered by the Jibauni. The official story was that government ships found it after long periods of trying to make hyperdrives, but popular tradition contradicts with the idea that a captain named Rindil Jibson discovered it just a few hundred years after the Jibauni were created - and years before the hyperdrive was invented.`
	spaceport `Little passenger service lies in the spaceport in the only city on Kahbani. A few immigrants are scattered preparing to officially enter the planet, but the vast majority of Kahbani's facilities carry cargo; another portion to feed Baitoon, one to go to Lamalmuq; it seems that plants fill the whole of the small spaceport.`

	description `Kanlil, as the stopover for pilgrims wishing to visit Lamalmuq, is quite busy. It also sells luxurious goods unavailable on the pilgrims' planet, such as personal tablets and cigars. Most trading in this system naturally passes through Kanlil.`
	description `	Surprisingly, the station is a fairly recent creation, only built two hundred years ago. Dertoy Enterprises, the original founder, went out of business soon afterwards; this contributes to the rumor that Kanlil has existed since the beginning of time as the Jibauni know it.`
	spaceport `Most Jibauni loitering on Kanlil wear black robes; the rest wear the generic spaceport employee uniforms that permeate Jibauni space. Many ships are docked to the station, and the spaceport workers are kept busy unloading and reloading the large amounts of traffic in Hajay.`
	spaceport `	The civilian landing area, called Qarib Najm, is the largest one of the rings composing Kanlil; apparently the other rings are reserved for military or Zaeim spacecraft. Many of them are unlighted; apparently uninhabited at present.`

	description `	This, they believe, is that planet, and so have been very careful not to spoil it.`
	spaceport `Compared to other Jibauni planets, and the station of Kanlil nearby, Lamalmuq is quite sparsely populated in the matter of spacecraft. Most of the ships are built for the sole purpose of passenger transport. One city exists on the surface; every other continent is untouched by any Jibauni methods.`

	description `	This planet is also a mining planet, so the rock has great scars in it at places and there are many machines to do the digging, which are scattered around parked looking very untidy.`
	spaceport `When coming down for landing, most of what can be seen is rock, though ships above the city see nothing but planets and trees, due to the haphazard nature of the Rebels that terraformed this planet. However, once down, the streets are wide and cool, with luxurious buildings and shady pathways.`

As the second largest planet in all of Jibauni space dedicated exclusively to food production, Sinsansun is famous in more ways than one - including the fact that all non-Jibauni animals here dislike light. Artificial shades cover much of the planet, although the above side is cleverly painted to look like the surface of the planet beneath.`
	spaceport `The market is flooded with animals, barrels, baskets, and buckets of other provisions; the price of food here is astoundingly low, as is the clothing commodity.
