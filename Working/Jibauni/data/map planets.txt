planet Andwerfen
	attributes capital jibauni "rebel jibauni" "seat of government"
	landscape land/andwerfen
	description `Obviously, Andwerfen is occupied by the Rebel Jibauni government. Fortified buildings and bunkers dot the whole city, in readiness to shoot invaders, and planetary defenses jut out of the landscape everywhere - even on the tops of buildings.`
	description `	Wahlkin, a Jibauni once a peaceful planet-dweller, was inspired by stories of new spacecraft and heroic feats of flight. Eventually he started exploring, and subsequently started the colony of Andwerfen, now grown into a full-fledged military academy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is filled by armed patrols keeping an eye out for any sign of rebellion. Every Jibauni you see wears a frightened expression, and many wish to escape back to normal Jibauni space.`

planet Baitoon

	landscape land/baitoon
	description `Baitoon is the planet where the Jibauni were created, and presumably where the seat of the Normal Jibauni government convenes. Many Jibauni move about in long, narrow passageways between the landing pads, many of which, old and cracked, have received no maintenance for generations.`
	description `	Other dinosaurs used to live on this planet, but the Jibauni have transplanted them to a different planet, Owiay, where they thrive and grow much better then they would in a land of T. Rexes.`

	description `	This planet is in the first system discovered by the Jibauni. The official story was that government ships found it after long periods of trying to make hyperdrives, but popular tradition contradicts with the idea that a captain named Rindil Jibson discovered it just a few hundred years after the Jibauni were created - and years before the hyperdrive was invented.`
	spaceport `Little passenger service lies in the spaceport in the only city on Kahbani. A few immigrants are scattered preparing to officially enter the planet, but the vast majority of Kahbani's facilities carry cargo; another portion to feed Baitoon, one to go to Lamalmuq; it seems that plants fill the whole of the small spaceport.`

	spaceport `Most Jibauni loitering on Kanlil wear black robes; the rest wear the generic spaceport employee uniforms that permeate Jibauni space. Many ships are docked to the station, and the spaceport workers are kept busy unloading and reloading the large amounts of traffic in Hajay.`

	description `	This, they believe, is that planet, and so have been very careful not to spoil it.`
	spaceport `Compared to other Jibauni planets, and the station of Kanlil nearby, Lamalmuq is quite sparsely populated in the matter of spacecraft. Most of the ships are built for the sole purpose of passenger transport. One city exists on the surface; every other continent is untouched by any Jibauni methods.`

	description `	This planet is also a mining planet, so the rock has great scars in it at places and there are many machines to do the digging, which are scattered around parked looking very untidy.`
	spaceport `When coming down for landing, most of what can be seen is rock, though ships above the city see nothing but planets and trees, due to the haphazard nature of the Rebels that terraformed this planet. However, once down, the streets are wide and cool, with luxurious buildings and shady pathways.`

But the animals here do not like light, and so there are artificial shades over a good portion of the planet, though the top of them has been very cleverly painted to look like the surface of the planet beneath.`
