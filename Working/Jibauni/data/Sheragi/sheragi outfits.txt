	description "This shielding system was initially developed to combat the ion storms splitting the middle of the new Sheragi territory. However upon discovering its effectiveness at reducing ion damage from Particle Waveform Cannons the Sheragi refined and improved the design allowing the charged particles to release absorbed energy into the ship's power systems, unleashing a new wave of warfare. One should be careful not to let the shield matrix of a ship using this system fully deplete as the resulting discharge will short circuit the capacitor, shutting down the system and resulting in a lengthy reboot."
