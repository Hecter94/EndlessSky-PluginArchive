			`	"Just so you know, I've contacted a few people in the Syndicate and floated your name around. Ever need anything, just tell them you know me. Might even be worth heading to Foundry and applying for the Syndicate."`
			`	The mood turns sour though when Sal steps off your ship to meet with Alvice and is grabbed by a group of heavily armed pirates. Sal looks shocked, but doesn't fight back against them. "Not like this!" he yells. "Think of all the good I've done you boys." The pirates don't seem to pay any attention to you.`

			`	You pull your gun and fire on the pirates. You take down two of them and duck for cover from the returning gunfire. That's when you hear a loud gunshot go off in the distance and feel a sharp pain in your chest. You fall down and retain consciousness for just long enough to turn around and find a giant hole in the hull of your ship where you were just taking cover. You aren't sure what you just got hit by, but it didn't feel good.`
