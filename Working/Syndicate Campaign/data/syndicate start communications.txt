# In one of these missions, I want to have some sort of interaction that highlights how the Syndicate sees religion. For example, one of the soon-to-be Syndicate workers that you see might have some religious iconography on them. Nate scoffs at it and mentions something about "brainwashing." The player can then either question Nate or agree with him. Should you question Nate, he asks you if you believe in a god. If you say no, he says "good." If you say yes, he says something like "I'd've thought you smarter than that. Just don't let the higher ups hear about that though. They'd be more pissy about it than me."
