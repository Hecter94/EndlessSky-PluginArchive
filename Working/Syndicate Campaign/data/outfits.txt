# 36 tons of cargo space becomes 12 tons of outfit space and 24 tons of space devoted to making sure that cooling outfits still work as intended. The downside of the Outfits Expansion is how it hurts cooling. The downside of the Precision Expansion will be how it hurts turning and acceleration given how much more massive it is.
# 1 outfit : 3 cargo space conversion compared to the Outfits Expansion's 3 outfit : 4 cargo space conversion.

	description "An outfits expansion system which converts cargo space into outfit space in a more precise manor, allowing for cooling systems to work properly at the cost of converting less space." # Description not finalized

# "Korath technology is highly complex," the engineer says to you. "The Syndicate has been studying it for over a century, and it may take a century more before we even begin to recreate it. But that does not mean that we have yet to gain any knowledge from it. Please, come with me."
# You follow the engineer to a large subterranian hangar containing a single Prospector. "The Prospector is a massive ship, truly capable to handling itself in combat, but almost no match to even the weakest of Free Worlds' capital ships. It simply doesn't have the space to contain all the weapons and systems it would need to be a viable warship, and using outfits expansions to convert its impressive cargo space into usable outfit space only yields disaster on the ship's cooling systems. We have found that Korath ships have much this same struggle in needing to prevent their hideously inefficient technology from overheating their ships."
# The engineer enters the Prospector's cargo hold, beckoning you to follow. "One way that the Korath seem to get around this is by rearranging the inner workings of their ships in order to better handle heat production from systems. It was quite difficult, but we've figured out how to do the same to a Prospector without harming the ship's integrity."
# The engineer waves his hand in front of him, drawing your attention to the cargo hold of the Prospector. It looks far different from the inside of any Prospector you have seen before. Rather than the massive empty space of a normal Prospector, this Prospector has been modified with additional walls and cooling ducts snaking around running power and shield generators. It isn't a pretty sight, but at least it is functional.

# Precision expansions require specific knowledge of the design of the ship itself. This means that at first they will only appear on a select few Syndicate ships where the design with precision expansions has been perfected, and only later on will they become available to the player to install on all ships. Yes, lore pretty much ends up going out the window with this outfit as soon as you talk about bringing alien ships to human space in order to install these things.

# The following is MZ's explanation of outfits expansions reducing cooling efficiency.
#
# The idea is that when ship designers determine the layout for a new model
# of ship, they carefully account for the amount of heat that the outfit
# sections will produce and either lay them out in a way that avoids hot
# spots, or add built-in heating ducts or heat sinks to wick the excess heat
# out to the hull. (Basically, the same way that CPU designers spread out the
# components of the chip that draw the most power.)
#
# If you start rearranging the interior of your ship, that careful balance
# gets out of whack, and it also becomes harder to lay out extra cooling
# ducts and stuff like that.

# Have fun.

# Excerpts from a discussion regarding what unique outfits should be unlocked through the Syndicate campaign
# "To my understanding, the Wolf Pack have only recently aquired nukes. The Syndicate on the other hand have been planning things out for a while and have had much more time than the Wolf Pack. There's also the fact that the Syndicate have better infrastructure than the Wolf Pack, so it wouldn't be surprising to me that the Syndicate would have some sort of loading system for their nukes and the Wolf Pack wouldn't.
# Taken from FW Checkmate: `He laughs. "I'm afraid that's not possible. Unlike most missile systems, we haven't yet developed any sort of feed system that would let you fire multiple missiles from the same gun port. So, it's a weapon you can only fire once from a given port."`

	description "It has been centuries since the last nuclear war was fought, and until very recently, most people in the galaxy assumed that that era of chaos and destruction was forever behind us..."

# "If you're interested in buying one, go to <pirate planet> at these coordinates. We're keeping our stores of nuclear weapons off Syndicate soil in case things go south. We'd rather be able to deflect the blame on to pirates and a select few Syndicate employees instead of the whole of the Syndicate itself."

# So, who's going to have fun with this monstrocity?
#	Too massive to fit on anything smaller than a light warship, and even then a few smaller light warships can't equip it
# 	Fires once every 10 seconds (a bunch of singular missiles would fire faster)
#	Takes 40 seconds of non-stop firing to empty its hopper
#	Yields a maximum of 45,000 shield damage or 35,000 hull damage
#	This is beat out by the Punisher Torpedo's total yield of 60,000 shield damage or 76,000 hull damage, but it takes longer (52 seconds) for the Punisher Torpedo to fire all its ammo
#	7.6 million credits to buy and fill with ammo vs the Punisher Torpedo's 2.65 mil

# Do you think it's worth passing up over a cloaking device? Probably not, but I'd say its pretty damn close compared to the FW Checkmate-Reconciliation reward different. Like seriously, who wants some afterburner, some shield generators that become obsolete as soon as you meet more aliens, and a crappy nuclear missile that you can only load one of in each gun port when you can have a device that can't be beat at any tier (yet)? This warhead loading system on the other hand is useful as long as you have the money and as long as we can't buy Finisher Launchers, as the Finisher Torpedo is the only secondary weapon that beats out the warhead loading system in terms of damage yield. (By comparison, the Nuclear Missile obtained through the Checkmate branch is technically beat by all but the Javelin, Meteor, and Sidewinder missile launchers.)
# Going to be honest, I would totally take this over a cloaking device just so I could use a bunch of them on a Kar Ik Vot. Load up 5 on a Shield Beetle and say goodbye to whatever you're staring at, because it's about to eat 4,500 shield damage and 3,500 hull damage of pure pain per second multiplied by however Shield Beetle you have (along with an instantaneous 45,000 shield and 35,000 hull damage right from the start from the first launched nukes. Three Shield Beetles with 5 loading systems each and that Kar Ik Vot is going to be instantly disabled, and unlike the normal Nuclear Missile you still have 4 more left over for whoever else enters the system.)

# We all love our cannon weapons: the Plasma Cannon, Particle Cannon, and Proton Gun. The Plasma Cannon gets its own little upgrade in the FW story, gaining a dual turret version. Maybe the Syndicate's cannon, the Proton Gun, should get its own little upgrade. Seeing as how the Proton Gun now has its own single turret version, just giving it a dual turret version would be bland. So how about something more powerful instead?

# "Now the Proton Gun has never been capable of competing with the Particle Cannon. In a market sense, maybe, but never in military terms." He pulls the cloth off of the object in front of you, revealing a massive gun. "The Neutron Gun changes everything about that."

# The magnificant Neutron Gun seeks to compete with the Particle Cannon of the Navy; it fires further (even if only by 4 range), travels almost as fast (26 vs 30 velocity) and deals 37.7% more damage thanks to being able to fire 33.3% faster than its predecessor. Although it doesn't have the accuracy of the Particle Cannon and it does require more energy and produce (way) more heat, you should still totally buy it, because as we all know, the Proton Gun is the best cannon there is!
