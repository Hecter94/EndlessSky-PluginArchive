This file is a draft of the PR summary for when I PR the Syndicate campaign. This'll be a big one, so I want to write down any idea that pop into my head as they come.



After months and months (and years) of procrastinating, the Syndicate campaign is finally finished! Even with the ability to pull the trigger on my own, this PR will likely be sitting here for a while to take feedback before being merged. I'd very much prefer a review and feedback from @endless-sky given the scale of this addition before it is merged.
Speaking of the scale of this addition, this PR summary is rather large in its own right. I'd highly suggest reading the entire thing before reviewing the contents of the PR, or at the very least read the first two parts if you don't want to spoil yourself, as this PR summary will include a summary of each part of the campaign as a TL;DR for those who don't want to go through the entire thing until it's finished.

# Special Thanks

I'd like to start with a special thanks to everyone who helped me finish this, no matter how small their contribution.
Startome, Elyssaen, Kiko, and Messy for contributing various ideas as we discussed what to possibly do with the Syndicate campaign far before actually doing any writing for it, whether or not their ideas ended up being used.
Kiko for providing rough (and I mean very rough) drafts for the pre-war and Sal strings of missions.
Kiko, @LocalGod79, and @Wrzlprnft for the initial development of the Prospector
@MessyMix and @Fzzr for directly contribution various small spelling and grammar fixes and/or wording changes.
@Vilhelm16 and @Disuize for generally catching typos.
@RestingImmortal for bug catching.
@TheUnfetteredOne for emotional support and for kicking me into working on this when I realized that I've been spending way too long ["world-building."](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/blob/62cb2897bc8eaf93a5f1e0c24bd84481e274a959/data/news.txt#L343)

# Design Philosphy and Troubles

Wanted more branching and for karma to play a bigger role. One intro that lead into the player choosing one of three jobs to apply for, each job being a separate start. Would also be three middles. Each start and middle would also contain its own branch at some point akin to the FW decision to attack the pirate worlds and get booted from the FW for a bit, although with more morally ambiguous decisions that still effected your karma. Wanted four ending branches; the player would be given the choice of defecting (going with Sawyer and making sure he safely reaches the FW/Navy), becoming an extremist (being one of the ones to kill of Sawyer), or staying within the Syndicate to root the extremists out from the inside. This final decision would branch again based off of your karma, having an entire ending branch be based off of your past decisions; if your karma is good, Sawyer makes it safely to the FW/Navy. If your karma is bad, Sawyer is murdered and you have to somehow fix things with the FW now flinging nukes at the Navy.
Ultimately realized that the scale desired was too much to get anything done. Decided to cut down the planned work to be on the same scale as the FW campaign; one intro, one start, one middle, two ends. Open to the possibility of expanding the Syndicate campaign with the other ideas in the future though, perhaps alongside an expansion to the FW campaign to allow the player to join the Wolf Pack instead of the FW proper. 

One of the things I struggled with is the idea that the Syndicate seems to bar females from positions of power. "All Syndicate leaders are male" according to the wiki, and FW Syndicate Diplomacy 1C describes the Syndicate as "notoriously misogynistic." Given that no assumptions can be made of the players sex, I was prevented from giving the player any sort of real power within the Syndicate, as otherwise the player could be female and therefore break lore. Instead, the player ends up interacting with various characters within the Syndicate that follow the corporate orders but also often act of their own accord, helping to give the player a level of autonamy that they might otherwise not have within the corporate and "misogynistic" structure of the Syndicate. 

Looking back at the wiki, this time looking toward the Story Ideas page, I had a look at the "Korath raids," "Pirates and anarchists," "Corporations," and "Rich vs. poor" paragraphs. 
With regards to the first two paragraphs, I often mention Eve Online from time to time, and something I've heard about from Eve Online is corporations having a griefing arm that will attack pilots who just bought goods from the manufacturing arm, therefore forcing the pilot to purchase the goods from the manufacturing arm again and increase the profits for the manufacturing arm. This tied into the Syndicate story by dealing with the idea of the Syndicate paying pirates to attack merchant convoys, therefore enticing said merchants to purchase Syndicate defense goods, or as mentioned outright requiring captains of fleets to repurchase Syndicate goods for new ships that replace the lost ones. In this way, the Syndicate subsidizes and encourages the pirate lifestyle for those already in it.
With regards to the latter two paragraphs, I tried to have these ideas play into some of the internal conflict within Syndicate place that the player partakes in. E.g. deal with (relatively) smaller corporations like Megaparsec, with the poor conditions of Syndicate workers and how the Syndicate may exploit workers for all they're able, leading to protest.
