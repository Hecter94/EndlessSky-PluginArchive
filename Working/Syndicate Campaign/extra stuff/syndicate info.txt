Syndicate Worlds:
	Lesser Worlds:
		Amazon
			A tropical world with no edible plants and is difficult to farm on. Some oil drilling, a good tourism destination, a frontier world.
		Antipode
			A tundra planet covered in glaciers. Few settlements. Mines rare earth metals for electronics. A frontier world
		Bluestone
			Dim, red skied world, barely populated. Researches edible hybrid crops that grow on similar dim worlds. Drills for oil to make plastics. A frontier world.
		Burthen
			Super high gravity for humans. Produces short, strong, health issue ridden population. A mining world.
		Canyon
			High gravity for humans, but not as uncomfrotable as Burthen. Most of the farming occurs in fertile canyons, as the high mesas are lifeless. Rumors of being home to an ancient alien civilization. A frontier world.
		Charybdis Station
			A deuterium refinery owned by the Syndicate. No spaceport, so can't repair or refuel.
		Crossroads
			Uranium strip mining. Sandstorms have apparently been getting worse in recent years, and given the urnaium mining the sands are somewhat radioactive. Likely has a high cancer rate.
		Hippocrates
			Mostly settled by scientific research outposts. 10 billion years old around a small red dwarf, so lots of time for life to evolve, but nothing advanced. Spaceport not designed for large ships. A frontier world.
		Icefall
			Far from sun with wide tilt. Cold and hard to farm on, but farmers still farm. Oil drilling near equator. A frontier world.
		Kraken Station
			700+ years old. The first space station build outside of Sol. A deuterium refinery. Near earth
		Lodestone
			Rich in rare minerals, but otherwise difficult to live on due to being volcaniclly active. Eruptions take out the spaceport every once in a while.
		Nimbus
			Wild weather, going from stormy to sunny in no time. Industry is driven by sea, e.g. fishing. Extract medical compounds from the micoorganisms.
		Oberon Station
			Another deuterium refinery owned by the Syndicate.
		Placer
			A frontier world, mostly uninhabited except for a small mining outpost. Inhabitance must wear breathing masks due to the amonia and sulfur rich atmosphere. Has had unsuccessful research experiments to have micro-organisms change the atmospheric composition to be more human.
		Quicksilver
			Volcanic mining world. Has violent weather, such as lots of hurricanes and thunderstorms. 
		Sundive
			A tropical world with enough open plains to make it a major farming world. Tornadoes and thunderstorms are fairly common during the summer. Has large radio telescope arraies that study the galactic core and the super massive black hole there. A frontier world.
		Trove
			A small moon where the Syndicate does something called "jack mining" where they bust open the crust to mine the core. Most of the work is done by machines.
	Greater Worlds:
		Delve
			The biggest mining world in the region. Most cities are actually underground in old mines, and the inhabitance fear of cave ins and power failures given that ventilation must get breathable air kilometers down into the mines.
		Foundry
			Home to the Syndicated Shipyards, where >50% of freighters are made. High pollution from all the factories. The Syndicate is generous in its worker attitude here, allowing workers as much as an entire month of vacation time each year. Claims that this leads to better rested and relaxed workers that do better at producing ships, so less errors that could be terrible in space. Urban planet.
		Furnace
			The military capital of the Syndicate. Largely uninhabited aside from the military.
				`Syndicate doctrine claims that corporate structure and process produce a leaner and more effective military force without the perceived wastage of the Republic Navy. But in practice, they seem to have combined all the worst aspects of military and corporate bureaucracy.`
		Hephaestus
			Home to Syndicated Systems, which makes the outfits that the Syndicate use. Known to be highly efficient and dependable in their production, but not the best outfits around.
		Maker
			Where most inhabitance of Earth leave to go to. The Syndicate offers free transportation and housing to here, but essentially put people into indentured servitude for five years in a mine or factory. Takes anywhere from five to ten years to work up the money to leave.
		Millrace
			An overpopulated factory and manufacturing world. The second greatest destination for those leaving Earth. Most of the production here goes to other worlds for building ships or driving other industries, so this is a key world for basic materials. Pays a living wage for workers to be able to leave. This feeds a cycle where old workers leave and new workers come in to replace them. The Syndicate believes that this will not stop any time soon. Near Earth.
		Moonshake
			Another overpopulated factory world. Production doubles every few decades given the incoming immigrants. A regional center for reactor-grade plutonium, textiles, and molded plastic parts. Dense wilderness wherever there isn't a factory or city that will get plowed over whenever expansion is needed.
		Reunion
			Mostly urban factory world, very Earth like and inhabited early on. A highly political planet. Near Earth.
		Shangri-La
			An ideal paradise. Mostly rich and urban, if not is uninhabited mountains. Nearly self-sufficient. Use to be a big target for pirates before the Syndicate started protecting it more. Pirates would attack the rich ports and carry off goods and even human slaves. A frontier world.
		Sunracer
			Home of Megaparsec Industries. Nearly half a billion people. Diverse economy, with fishing, farming, and ship factories. 
		Tinker
			A highly industrial world that exports electronics to all of the Syndicate. More of a skilled-labor world than a poor-worker world. Most of the materials for the electronics actually come from the world itself, with regions devoted to mining and refineries. Near Earth.

Stuff we learn about the Syndicate from the story + some other important info
	Intro
		* The Barb gets released 20 days after the war starts along with the X1050 Ion Engines.
			* The proton variant gets released about 230 days after the war starts
		* Ijs "Eyes" Springborn is hated by the Syndicate. He goes from world to world, checking the emissions of their nuclear plants.
		* The Syndicate had a situation a while back when they had fully autonamous mining colonies that would be raided by pirates, and Parliament passed an act that made leaving robots unsupervised be considered a legal salvage operation.
		* The Syndicate have a long record of environmental and human rights violations, but they are also the single largest employer in the galaxy, and a main reason for the stability the Republic has enjoyed for the last few centuries.
	Start
		* The Free Worlds manage to defeat the Navy twice, and decide to sent a diplomatic mission to the Syndicate
		* The Syndicate heads are considered "trusted friends of the Republic" and learn some things about the war situation that the public does not.
		* The Free Worlds diplomatic mission strikes a deal between the Syndi and FW that the FW will defend Syndi convoys to Tarazed, and in return be allowed to buy Syndi weapons indirectly through Tarazed, along with the Barb.
		* Tarazed is run by a female CEO named Emily Lane. 
		* After all this diplomacy, Tarazed becomes neutral in the war. 
		* Poisonwood gets "alien visitors" that are also concerned about the Alphas.
		* The Poisonwood governer tells the player about the Disappearence and the Alpha situation on the planet that happened three decades ago, leading to Poisonwood remaining loyal to the Republic.
		* Barmy Edward thinks that the quad turret blasters are crap. Develops the Plasma Turret near the end of FW start
		* The FW liberate the Men system. Now that they aren't pirates, they need their deuterium refinery fixed
			* The Syndicate and the Free Worlds make a deal to get Men parts for a deuterium refinery. They meet on Tundra and swap the parts/money

			* `set "fw first chapter done"`
			* Player is left on own for a bit
	Middle
		* The Syndicate and FW have almost no contact through most of the middle
		* The Syndicate, near the end of FW middle, attack New Tibet because they are sheltering the defector. This would be the branching situation. Do you let the defector go to the FW, do you join the battle to get him back, or do you defect with him?
			* The FW learns that the Syndicate started the war and tested their nukes on Mutiny, but do not have the evidence unless they have the defector.
			* If you help the defector
				* Sawyer is the defector. He helped to create the nuke but did not know what it was for; and he didn't ask either.
				* Sawyer tells you that the Syndicate profits have doubled because of the war. 
				* Sawyer defects because, after the last major battle, he realizes that millions will die for their crime if something is not done. 
				* Katya is given back to the Free Worlds if they decide to shelter the defector
			* If you don't help the defector
				* The FW and the Wolf Pack start fighting together
				* The Wolf Pack start nuking Navy fleets
				* FW "liberate" Delta Sagittarii
			* FW Middle ends
	Rec
		* After the Syndicate attack New Tibet to get Sawyer, Raven states how they have essentially incriminated themselves at this point.
		* Syndicate has so much power in Parliament that even with large amounts of evidence, the Syndicate are still not persecuted.
		* An FW captain along with Raven go to Mutiny to collect samples of the nuclear testing, and the Syndicate try and stop them.
		* The Syndicate have begun using new technology.
		* The Navy doesn't attack the Syndicate until they are given the order, even though the Syndicate are clearly at fault here and are attacking FW ships.
		* The Syndicate would prefer war over major economic recession.
		* After the hearing in Parliament, the Deep contact Sawyer and the FW captain. The Deep protect Sawyer (the safest place for him to be) and send the FW captain alongside Oathkeepers and Deep ships to retrieve someone who was behind the bombing.
		* Everyone across human space realizes that the Syndicate are guilty, but the hesitation comes from not knowing what to do about it.
		* There are plenty of contacts on the anarchist worlds around the Core that have information on the Syndicate. A former Syndicate manager turned pirate provides the FW and Navy with information on the people who were behind the bombing.
		* The Navy decides to capture Alexander Soylent, a big financial leader for the Syndicate who was the first to decide to start a war.
		* The Syndicate begin using nukes after the allied fleet takes Soylent.
		* The Syndicate spin a narrative that a renegade fleet tried to assasinate a Syndicate Exec, and have used this as an excuse to move nuclear armed fleets to Sol.
			* Danforth comments that should the Syndicate fleet be attacked, humanity might end up splintering into half a dozen factions at a possible loss of Republic Parliament and thus the collapse of the Republic.
			* Katya comments that an FW ship entering Sol could be a spark that ignites a flame.
		* Hyperspace links begin disappearing. Rand is the first to fall. Confusion spreads, but there is an idea that the Syndicate might be doing this.
			* At the moment that the Syndicate fleet over Sol retreated, the link between Earth and Syndi space was cut. 
			* The number of coincidences lead everyone to believing that the Syndicate is doing this.
		* The FW captain meets with Parliament, and they want them to go through the only remaining link to Syndicate space in the north.
			* There are rumors that just before the links were cut there was massive fleet movement and rumors of some sort of internal power struggle going on.

			* The raid on Nimbus allowed some of the extremists to go into hiding.
			* The CEO reveals the existance of the Pug and Korath
			* The Syndicate have been dealing with the Korath for years and plundering any Jump Drives they can. 
		* The FW captain discovers the Pug and speaks with them. They then report to Parliament that it is the Pug that are cutting the links, but the Syndicate will be supplying jump drives for an attack fleet.
		* Marco Bugati - A senior exec that seems to head up Syndicated Systems, or at least the part of it dealing with alien tech.
		* The Navy, FW, and Syndicate together beat back the Pug. Focus changes to taking down the Extremists.
		* "Years ago" the Syndicate obtained the Oracle from the Alphas in exchange for jump drives.
