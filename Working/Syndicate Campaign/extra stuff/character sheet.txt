Syndicate:
	Established:
		* Alastair Korban: Syndicate CEO. Described as being someone who doesn't like to admit that he has done something wrong.
		* Marco Bugati: The Syndicate executive in charge of the engineers working on Korath technology.
		* Sawyer: A Syndicate physicist involved in the creation of the nukes. Didn't ask questions, but felt that he needed to out the Syndicate after seeing the destruction that the battles between the Navy and Free Worlds was causing. Good friends with Johansen. No given first name (Give him one? Kevin?).
		* Alexander Soylent: High ranking exec that is part of the main financial team for the Syndicate. One of the big players in deciding to incite a war.
	Creating:
		* Adam Johansen: Merchant that does business for the Syndicate, eventually fully hired into it. Seems to be genuine and down to earth on the surface but in reality cares nothing more than to get money.
			Predisposition: Justice branch. Adam is new to the Syndicate, just like you, and in the end all he wants is some sort of stability to be able to do his job and get paid. Wants you to stay and try and sweep the extremists out under the radar, as Alastair Korban wants, and thinks that defecting is too risky.
			
		* Salidar Garcia: Although not technically part of the Syndicate, has vast amounts of sway due to corruption. Is able to dodge the beauracracy that would normally go along with the player.
			Predisposition: Extremist branch. He's already practically an extremist
			
		* Nate Remington: Public affairs dude. A very "doesn't matter as long as it looks good" kind of person. Young and new to the Syndicate, but is so successful making the Syndicate look good that he's already at a high position after only a few years. Likes to play hero, thinks he's above everyone else. Loves the sound of his own voice. Might be an acoholic/sex addict. Used to rich living.
			Predisposition: Defector branch. Originally supported the extremists. Even did much of the coverup when something was about to go public when the nukes were originally being made and tested. But Remington has the same type of realization as Sawyer and ends up trying to get you to defect as well.
			
		* Thomas Hensley: Some sort of Syndicate military leader. HATES the honor above all else attitude of the Navy, and the Navy itself in many ways. Always speaks as if he's 10 minutes late to something. Usually a strict and by the (Syndicate) books guy, but will change his attitude on a dime to try to play situations into his favor. Tends to repeat himself when in this mode. Very obvious to someone who knows Hensley and has seen it happen before, almost appearing bipolar. This also means that he's going to seem very different to the player once the player is part of the Syndicate as compared to when the player meets him as a merchant. "You aren't a merchant anymore, cadet <last>, so you follow my orders now!" Could turn this into some sort of option that the player can play on in the future. e.g. Hensley tries to go into nice guy mode during an argument with the player and you can say "don't you pull that shit on me!" or something to that effect.
			Predisposition: Extremist branch. Wants to support the extremists against the Navy and FW just to try and stick one over on the Navy.
		
		* Hensley and Remington are good friends
		* Sal and Hensley aren't on good terms
		* Sawyer and Johansen are old friends, but Johansen doesn't really know anyone else
		* Soylent and Remington hang out together a lot
