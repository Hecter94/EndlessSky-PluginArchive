	3) Travel to Shangri-La, where a large pirate force has attempted to plunder the rich frontier world.
	4) Travel to Deadman's Cove, the source of the attack, and retrieve any stolen goods and slaves

Post-bombing main string: Meet and help Sal, a Syndicate fixer and contractor, who is dealing with some shady business.
	1) Run into Sal while in a spaceport and he asks you to transport something from the Deep to the Syndicate. The pay is rather large and the way he describes it seems off, so the player is able to decline without consequence. 
	2) Arrive in the Deep to have the cargo loaded. Get stopped by a DS Guard and questioned about what you're doing. Be allowed to go on your way. Speak with Sal on return.
	3 + alt) Sal wants you to transport a few friends of his friends to a frontier world. Followed by a Syndicate ship.
	4) After landing with the "friends", they board another ship and make their way toward the pirate worlds. Sal wants you back on some other world.
	5) Notice someone sneaking around the spaceport when Sal shows up, late, and pulls your attention away. Look back and the stranger is gone. Sal wants you to scan the cargo of a ship that's about to leave, then land on the planet once you're done. Scan the ship and it has nuclear testing equipment. On return to Foundry to Sal's private hangar, Sal says he's trying to find out who's behind the bombings and thinks who you just scanned has something to do with it. "Get out of my hangar and meet me in the spaceport. I don't enjoy having guests here for too long."
	6) Meet with Sal in the hangar and he bad mouths the FW. "It's probably them. Innocent until proven guilty and all, you know. No one has any hard proof and the Navy's too afraid to pull the trigger and find it." Sal asks you to bring him to a nearby pirate world so that he can speak with his "contacts".
	7) Sal brings you to a island complex on Deadman's Cove because he wants you to stick near him and make sure you're fine. Bump into a pirate, he pulls a knife and looks at you, he looks at Sal and puts the knife away, then says "Be careful who you associate with, punk." Sal speaks with contact who says how everyone's loving the situation because of how the Navy are disoriented. "This'll be great for business." "I'm sure it will be for scum like you." They both laugh. "Now get off my island!" the warlord says as he motions to his men to remove you, still laughing along with Sal. On return in a private hangar of Sal's, he speak with the CEO.
	8) The CEO suggests speaking with more warlords. Sal explains to the player how most pirates may be anarchists and not give two shits about what the Syndicate wants, but Sal is the Syndicate's main contact to the major pirate warlords. He makes a joke about the last guy he had to bring him places looking at a warlord wrong and being shot, then laughs it off and suggest you go to Stormhold to have a chat with another warlord.
	9) Chat with a warlord on Stormhold. This warlord says they have a rat in the Navy giving them some intersting information about the possible origins of the nukes. Also suggests checking Covert and Bucanneer Bay, but Sal mentions how the last time he spoke with the warlords down there they said they'd kill him if he ever showed back up. Player does something that they shouldn't, and as you leave Sal looks you dead in the eyes and says he wasn't joking about the person before you that died. Land back on a Syndicate world where Sal says he needs to do some work in the Paradise Worlds.
	10) Land on Glory. Meet some plastic surgeried moneybags pissed about the Navy spreading out more. Moneybags gives a sealed box to Sal, which isn't explained to the player.
	11) Land on Prime to meet a "business associate" in private.
	12) Land on Hestia for Sal to meet an "old friend." Sal makes a joke about thinking of retiring there. Get word of needing to pick something up on Geminus.
	13) Pick something up from Geminus; Sal refuses to leave the ship and tells you where to find the pickup point, which is a box marked radioactive. Return it to a Syndicate world.
	14) Sal wants you to bring him back to Stormhold to have a chat with the warlord again.
	15) Sal is pulled off of your ship as soon as the doors open. "Not like this. Think of all the good I've done you boys." The pirates tell you to get back and leave. Try and save Sal and you die. Leave and as you try to get out of there quick, you hear a number of shots go off. Sal "dies" off screen. Launch.

	Having met with multiple Syndicate employees or afiliated people and learning a bit about how the Syndicate works, decide to apply for the Syndicate in one of three jobs.

__________________ Side Plots __________________

_________ Start (shared plot points) ___________
Learn about the Navy/FW fight
Hear about creation of Oathkeepers

____________ Communications Start ______________
# Syndicated Communications: more diplomatic and directly involved in the dealings that the Syndicate has with the Free Worlds (you get to meet Alondo) and Republic. Probably going to have a situation where you fly through a warzone and get shot at by some trigger happy FW interceptors. Maybe even involve coming into contact with the Hai. Will focus on passenger missions, but might also have combat in the form of fighting bounty hunters. Probably won't deal with the Korath Raiders (but might hear about them). 

Major plot points:
	* Syndicate supporting both sides of the war
	* Deal with drop in migration to Syndicate factory worlds caused by the war
	* Syndicate speaks with Megaparsec about creation of new ship(s) or cheaper ships for the Syndicate
	* Remington investigate disappearance of Sal

Internal Politics
	7. Return to worrying about home base; the fear caused by the war has dropped migration numbers to factory worlds ever since the bombing. Bring Nate to some major Syndicate world to discuss this. [Transport]
	8. Continue the work from the into of building up frontier worlds; making frontier worlds better places increases the cost of moving there, therefore keeping more workers in the factories longer. "We can't just force them to stay." Five missions or so working with frontier worlds. [Transport/Cargo/Combat/Escort]
	9. With less workers leaving, now get more workers to show up. Travel to urban Republic worlds to advertise for the Syndicate. Three or four misions doing this. [Transport/Cargo/Escort]
	10. Now travel to Megaparsec to speak with them; make a deal about buiding a new ship (Prospector). Megaparsec also promises to provide ships at a discount to the Syndicate, helping to build up their fleets. Help bring supplies to Megaparsec for the building of the new ship. Fight off pirates. Say three missions. [Transport/Cargo/Combat/Escort]
	11. Megaparsec have to deal with raids from Stormhold; travel to Stormhold to negotiate. Say two missions, involving fighting pirates that refuse to negotiate. Remington calls in Syndicated Security to deal with it. [Transport/Combat]
Disappearance of Sal
	12. Having visited the pirate world, Nate thinks about Sal. Asks you about what happened. [Transport]
	13. Travel to Deadman's Cove. Speak with Alvice about what happened. Alvice doesn't budge, claiming he needs work done first. Storyline branches depending on if player does the work for Alvice or not, doing the work being bad karma. [Transport]
	14a. Do 7 or 8 jobs for Alvice, giving the player bad karma but letting them in on Sal's fate. Involve flying pirate colors for a bit. Deal with Alvice's friends in the far north.
	14b. Refuse Alvice's offer. Do 7 or 8 normal jobs instead. One includes bringing the refinery equipment to be picked up by the FW.
		Nate leaves the choice up to you. "You were there when he got dragged off. I can't believe Alvice would've had him killed, but if you were there and saw it then I'll believe you."
	15. Nate hears about a spy in the FW that's gone cold. Tells you he needs to deal with it. Break in the storyline.
	16. When Nate contacts you again, tells you about your "promotion." Given choice of which middle branch to go into next.
_______________ Security Start _________________
# Syndicated Security: A combat focused branch. Early on involves fighting local pirates, maybe even having some diplomacy with local warlords to swap them to independent. Later involves fighting the Korath Raiders and acquiring jump drives. Given access to war-freighter versions of the Prospector for testing.

_____________ Prospecting Start ________________
# Syndicated Prospecting: mining and exploration focused. Has some pirate fighting and you do have a runin with the Korath. Includes stuff like mining uranium and other materials for the construction of nukes and other new tech (not entirely known to the player). Directly involved in the unlocking of the Prospector ship. Might get to meet the Hai since you'll probably be hanging around in the Far North.

Major plot points:
	* Creation of the Prospector
	* Mining uranium for the Syndicate
	* Mining of strange minerals for study
	* Bump into Hai
	* Bump into Korath

The Breakout of War
	1. The player is contacted about getting the job; told to travel to some planet.
	2. Find Johansen at said planet. Receive word that the FW and Navy have started fighting. Johansen says something about being happy he doesn't need to worry about it. "Mining asteroids all day is grunt work."

	11. Stumble upon the Hai wormhole. Go to the other side and explore Hai space. Two missions.
	12a. Tell the Syndicate about the Hai. 7 or 8 missions dealing with the Hai. (bad karma)
	12b. Don't tell the Syndicate about the Hai. 7 or 8 normal missions. 
	13. Vacation time. Break in the storyline.
	14. When Johansen contacts you again, tells you about your "promotion." Given choice of which middle branch to go into next.
_____________ Technology/Research Middle ________________
# Technological Advancement: Deals with making contact with the Korath and Hai. Create new technologies based on alien tech. Syndicate shield generators could be directly based off of Hai generators. Korath likely too advanced for the Syndicate to create much from their tech. Possibly create a precision expansion outfit by working with Korath heat shunts, figuring out how the Korath make such dang good cooling.
# Meet Marco Bugati
# Either you tell the Syndicate about the Hai, or Johansen does.

______________ Military Middle _________________
# Military Expansion: The Syndicate ramps up their military in these "uncertain times." Involves conquering a pirate world (for show) and testing out new technology on the Korath (mod proton gun) and local Pirates (Class C Freighter). Given that the Navy is split between the southern front and northern front, the Syndicate offer to act as security where the Navy has had to pull out. Might even involve some frontline battles, having the Syndicate fly Republic colors. (Some Navy fleets used Protectors during the war. Whether these were Syndicate in disguise or just the Syndicate selling warships to the Navy while they were low on capitals is unknown.) Having Syndicated Security act as the Navy will likely create tensions with Deep Security and the Oathkeepers.

______________ Espionage Middle ________________
# Corporate Espionage: the player gets noticed by some higher ups for their work in the start and is offered a high paying position as a corporate spy. Involves spying on companies outside of the Syndicate, and even on the workings of the Republic itself.

________________________________________________
# Justice: The player decides to let the defector go and prove the innocence of the Free Worlds while trying to take down the extremists from inside. This branch will split based off of your karma, because whether the FW go after the defector is a toss-up.
_____________ Justice-Recon End ________________
#	Justice-Reconciliation (Good karma): The player's good karma means that the FW end up going after and rescuing the defector. This means that the FW can prove itself innocent, and the extremists are backed into a corner. The extremists send their nuke armed fleet to Earth. The player goes after fleet before being trapped in Pug captured space. The player finds the remains of the nuke-armed fleet and must return to Syndicate space with the news.

_____________ Justice-Check End ________________
#	Justice-Checkmate (Bad karma): The player allows the defector to go, but the FW doesn't go after the defector. The defector gets killed by the few extremist forces that go after him and the FW start using nukes. With the Syndicate basically pointless when it comes to the war now, this branch will take a very different direction than has been seen before.
________________ Defector End __________________
# Defector: The player is lead to believe that most of the Syndicate is part of the extremist faction and defects with Sawyer, fighting off the extremists who come after him. The player ends up personally meeting members of the Free Worlds and Navy and essentially plays along a merged branch. Given that the player makes sure the defector gets to the FW alive, they have a means of showing their innocence and the FW don't use nukes; FW go Reconciliation

_______________ Extremist End __________________
# Extremist: The player decides to go after the defector and successfully returns him. From there it is a matter of making sure the Free Worlds are framed for the bombings and that no ties to the Syndicate are ever found. Because the player kills the defector, the FW can not prove its innocence and must turn to using nukes, so the FW go Checkmate.
