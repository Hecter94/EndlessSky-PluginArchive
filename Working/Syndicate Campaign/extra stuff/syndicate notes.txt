Replayability is the name of the game: we want the player to be able to play through the Syndicate story multipe times and be able to get a different experience each time, even if that's just tiny things like changing what you say to a character and having them treat you differently in the future, which doesn't change the plot.

Concern: I tend to write missions strings with some lengthy exposition before you get to the point of accepting or declining; this might need to be changed so that the player is given a chance to defer early on so that the player may defer if they don't want to do the mission and don't need to go through the exposition each time.

And what is said and who says it is based off of who you know more based off of who you've been around.
So hanging around Nate Remington in the start and then deciding to stay around him in the middle will lead to him having more say in conversation in the end
So say we get to the end of the middle and you get to the decision to go down the three end branches, Remington will have a predisposition to a certain branch and try to persuade you into that branch
And the player, having been around Remington for so long, will probably be more likely to choose what Remington says.
That's kind of part of what I don't like with the end decision in the FW story.
Freya and Alondo try and persuade us one way or another
The thing is, we've been around both characters the entire time so what they each want ends up meaning nothing to me
Because they're both characters worth listening to.
So I listen to neither of them in that moment.

Another idea I have, which seeks to fix how MZ hates that the end branch you take hinges on a single decision.(edited)
Your end branch is based off of two decisions instead of one, and on the second decision you can decide to go to one of the other two.
Might be complicated to explain, but here's how I see it:

Lets say one branch is that you go with the defector with evidence of your own against the Syndicate.
You fly to that monk planet and find Sawyer.
(at this point you're going down some sort of Defector branch)(edited)
Sawyer says that he has enough to incriminate the Syndicate on his own and that you should return to get rid of the extremists.
You either stay with him or go back. (your second decision)
If you decide to go back then once you return, you either fight the extremists or join them (the decision that decides which branch you're going down instead)

Now lets say you decide to let the defector go to the Free Worlds. (starting down an anti-extremist branch)
One of the characters tries to persuade you otherwise in a different mission to go get the defector.
You can decide to intercept the defector's escort (breaking off of current branch)
And then once you get to the defector, you can decide to kill him (switching over to an extremist branch) or go with him (switching over to a defector branch)
That being your second decision.

Now lets say you decide to go after the defector (first decision into an extremist branch)
You fight off the FW trying to get to him, then land and meet Sawyer.
Face to face with Sawyer, you can either let him go (switch to a flux between defector and anti-extremist) or kill him (final decision into extremist branch)
And if you're in that flux between defector and anti-extremist branches, then you break that flux by either returning to Syndicate space or following the defector.
____________________________
Seeing as how the FW story doesn't mention many characters that would be in the Syndicate and Navy story I guess it makes sense to keep away from naming names.
Like all we really hear about in terms of the Navy is Danforth and Nguyen, and for the Syndicate it's just Marco Bugati, Alastair Korben, Sawyer, and Alexander Soylent
So sticking to just mentioning Katya and Danfroth (other people remaining nameless to the player) makes sense to me
Unless (dun dun dun) the player did the intros of the other two branches before joining the Syndicate
Because at that point the player would know poeple like JJ, Freya, Katya, and Tomek having done the FW intro and will be able to know anyone in the Navy intro.
____________________________
Yeah. The player will end up being a useless person if they decide to defect and prove the FW innocent but the FW start nuking the Navy.
Maybe we can have mentions of your karma in the other branches. e.g.

Decide to defect. Your karma is good. You find that the FW also went after Sawyer, and together you fight off the extremists.
Decide to defect. Your karma is bad. You rescue Sawyer from the extremists and go to meet the FW council, finding out that they were preparing to use nukes but did not yet.
Whether your karma was good or bad at the beginning, the branch continues as normal.(edited)
And for Extremist

Decide to go extremist. Your karma is good. The FW try to go after Sawyer, but you blow them up. This forces the FW to need to use nukes
Decide to go extremist. Your karma is bad. You have no problem tracking down and killing Sawyer, and you hear news of the FW using nukes on Navy fleets.
____________________________
So the Defector branch is going to need to utilize conversation branching
____________________________
The Syndicate have a rat inside of the FW. For much of the start, the rat allows inside information to get to the Syndicate, and depending on who you're with to the player. This rat goes cold near the end of the start. Remington and Hensley finish the start by telling you they're going to investigate. 
During the Wolf Pack campaign, find out that the rat was actually taken out by the Pack.
____________________________
Syndi end where you're part of the nuke fleet (Extremist):
	Launch from Earth, fleet using patrol mechanics to warp ahead of you and stay in the next system, warp out of Sol, link closes behind you, fleet gets swarmed by Pug, eventually get a dialog saying they won't stop coming, warp to next system over and land, find the Syndicate scout who jump drived in, take their jump drive and escape.
Syndi end where you're w/ the Syndicate (Justice):
	You are the scout, warp into Pug space, find the decimated fleet with nuclear weapons, learning about what the Syndicate were up to.
_________________________________
When Prospector is being tested, it gets attacked. The player must stop it from being destroyed. Use this scenario to explain why the Prospector is not released when playing FW or Rep storylines; without the player, the destruction set the Prospector project back, and the Syndicate shut down the project
_________________________________
Something I just realized about the way we're doing the endings: it's ENTIRELY dependant on us. These endings are literally our decisions, and they aren't steering the entire faction in a certain direction(edited)
Unlike the FW storyline where our single decision steers the entire Free Worlds strategy

The whole reason why we need to make the Justice branch split based on whether the FW goes Checkmate or Reconciliation is because it isn't really our decision when playing the FW branch. It's a decision that the council makes, and we were only part of it.
Hold on, I'm having an epiphany that I need to wrap up.

Anyways, since the end decisions that we have planned for the Syndicate story are entirely based on us unlike those of the FW story, we (or whoever does write it) don't need to worry about the decisions that the Syndicate make when writing the Republic story in the same way that we do right now with the Syndicate worrying about the FW decision.
So in short, if we go ahead with these end branches as planned, there will probably be very little that we need to rewrite for it.
As for the Republic story, that would probably be ideal that they be made in parallel in terms of getting them done, but I'm not so sure how it'll be on continuity between branches unless there's a lot of conversation between the two teams.
I wouldn't be against another team doing the Rep story right now though.

I also want to have the branches cross at certains points. e.g. that one part diplomatic mission to a pirate world I mentioned. The role you play depends on your job but in the end it's essentially the same mission.
_________________________________
I talked to @Elyssaen in the past about what the Syndicate might be able to do with the pirates in the story. I recall talking about some pretty ballsy warlords becoming so much of a nusance that the Syndicate just has to deal with them. The Syndicate, not exactly liking what they need to do, decide to take over one of the pirate worlds in the region as a show of force to get the other pirates to calm the heck down. To the public they say something good like "we're arresting all the warlords. The end of their tyranny will be a great boost to prosperity in the core." But in reality they're just holding a fleet over the planet while they make deals with said warlord. Eventually the world is returned to the pirates (the Syndicate say that a massive pirate presence pushed the Syndicate out of the system, but in reality they just left), and pirate activity returns to normal.

The Syndicate have so much influence in the Republic Parliament that a Syndicate-on-Republic military branch should perhaps be assumed to have some backing from the Republic. Which at first seems a little counter-intuitive, but what if you played up Parliament's 'unhappiness' with the Oathkeepers' actions? Refusing to protect the Republic in war could be cast as treason.
There might be reasons to directly pressure the Deep as well, though I can't remember too well how/if the Deep fit into any of the conflict.
Ultimately, corporate interests would be to have Syndicated Security be the pre-eminent provider of security across the Republic, with the Navy delegitimised and increasingly sold off. Directly ruling Republic space is... eh, not ideal.

Alright, if it works out then it works out. Just going to paste what I've been writing this entire time: The idea of "your choices don't really matter" is kind of something I've been weaving in to the Syndicate stuff so far. If you join the Syndicate, the Free Worlds will function in very much the same way as if you joined them. A few small things here and there might be different but a majority of the stuff will likely stay the same. Then there's the fact that when it comes to the branch you choose, you might miss out on certain things created through other branches but without you those things still happen. There's thousands of other merchants out there for the Syndicate to hire.
The realization that your choices don't matter would then probably only happen after playing the game in all possible manners.

The Syndicate appear to be working on automaton technology, at least when looking at the test dummy jobs that now have a high level of confusion for the test dummies. This could be an interesting plot point, especially in relation to the Korath.
_________________________________
Due to Republic laws about automated stuffs, all automaton fleets of the Syndicate would need at least one human supervisor present.

Planet info (stuff derived from the planet descriptions):
	* Sundive is actually used to study Korath.
	* Crossroads is not the source of the uranium used in the nukes as it would be too easy to track; uranium was mined form asteroids.
	* Canyon was inhabited by the Hai.
	* Furnace is the home-base of Syndicated Security.
	* Millrace: unforseen consequence of war is less migration; Syndicate worlds start bleeding workers as old workers leave but new ones don't show up (Moonshake, Maker)
	* Moonshake: produces plutonium
	* Sunracer: home to Megaparsec, but what is the relation between Megaparsec and the Syndicate?

	Not very many systems with uranium; perhaps make more.
