### Timeline

2490: The pirate worlds of Buccaneer Bay and Greenrock are founded in the Core and the Rim, respectively.

2600: The Deep and the Paradise Planets have grown into powerful, isolated enclaves of high technology. The inhabited Core worlds and much of the Rim have fragmented into individual systems or small regions doing constant battle with each other and funding privateers to steal cargo from the others.

2660: In the Core, which is the end point of one of the major caravan routes, the Syndicate is beginning to gain power as it merges with smaller corporations in the area.

2680: Because none of the small Rim and Core corporations are as powerful as them, commerce is vastly unbalanced in favor of the Deep. Some of the small corporate governments try to establish their own trade zone, essentially boycotting the Deep and their caravan fleets.

2720: Several independent planets in the Core and Rim begin discussing joining together and forming a representative government with Earth as its capital.

2730: The Republic is formed, initially comprising Earth, the Rim systems closest to Quarg space, and several Core systems close to Earth, plus the few Dirt Belt worlds that are already inhabited.

2740: The Republic imposes trade embargoes on the Deep, the Syndicate, and the paradise worlds, exerting pressure on them to join the Republic.

2750: After years of nonviolent protests by their citizens, the Syndicate worlds agree to join the Republic, with the local governments becoming democratic instead of being solely administered by the Syndicate itself. Many of the newly elected officials, however, have ties to the Syndicate.

2810: The Syndicate shipyards begin producing small freighters to be piloted by one person or only a small crew. This is the first time that small merchant ships have been produced - previously all small ships were shuttles or fighters.

2850: The Syndicate is developing more mining colonies to supply the increased demand for ships and equipment.

2870: The Syndicate and other mining and manufacturing corporations are funding people to move to their colony worlds as workers.

2920: The spread of new colonies has stretched the Republic Navy thin, and piracy is once again on the rise in the corners of Syndicate space and on the Rim.

3000: The galaxy is beginning to slip into decadence, with megacorporations like the Syndicate once again gaining power.

### Regions and governments of space

The Core

You grew up in a crowded workers' barracks; your parents were both mill or factory workers, or perhaps miners on one of the frontier worlds. For as long as you can remember your parents have been talking about getting free of debt and moving someplace else, perhaps a farmstead on a Dirt Belt world where they can be their own masters. You were in school until the age of 13 or 14, but now you work alongside your parents. Your parents are quietly religious, but are ashamed of expressing their faith too openly (even to their children) because most people here regard religious faith as a mark of a backwards or uneducated person. If you are a girl, from a very early age you have been made to feel intellectually inferior to men.

Parliament

The Republic is government by elected members of Parliament. Worlds with large populations may have several representatives. In regions of space where planets are sparsely populated, a single member of parliament may represent an entire sector. Members of parliament are almost always elected from among the very wealthiest people, because of the cost of frequent space travel and other expenses associated with running a political campaign. Some people say that Parliament is entirely dominated by the Syndicate and the rich Paradise worlds, and does not look out for the interests of the poorer planets.

The Syndicate

The Syndicate is a powerful corporation that controls most of the worlds in the Core. Although technically part of the Republic, they have been given considerable autonomy to govern their own territory. All Syndicate leaders are male, and nearly all of them are fundamentalist atheists: that is, people who think atheism is the One True Religion and who treat members of other religions with open prejudice and disdain. The Syndicate is the source of much of the Republic's tax revenue, so Parliament seldom interferes in their business. Although criticized by some for their close ties to slave-trading pirates and for the outright misogyny of their leadership, the Syndicate is also recognized as the largest employer in human space, and people who need stable work flock to their planets.

The Southern Mutual Defense Pact

The Navy has increasingly taken to only defending the richer Paradise Worlds and left the southern part of human space to fend for itself. The Pact is the result of that: a loose coalition of planetary militias pledged to aid each other against any major pirate threat. Unlike the Syndicate, their leadership is almost half female... and almost entirely white, although this is mainly due to the demographics of the Rim and Dirt Belt worlds that they draw their members from. The Pact militias are generally viewed as heroes in the south, but regarded with suspicion by the citizens of the richer worlds in the North.
___________________________________________________________________
### Story ideas

Korath raids

Occasionally on the coreward edge of Syndicate space you get attacked by Korath ships. My plan for the Syndicate early story was that it would involve fighting various pirates, culminating with taking on the Korath themselves. There is a conversation with the Korath that happens if you land on the one planet in their territory, but that's really just a placeholder and could be completely rewritten.

Rich vs. poor

Think of the Free Worlds as something akin to the Occupy movement, with all the idealism and justice focus and naivete and disorganization and issues with authority that that implies. (They aren't quite communists, but like Russia / Cuba / N. Korea they talk about equality while in fact a few charismatic leaders (the Council) make all the real decisions.) They're very focused on a perceived "war" between the rich and the poor, the 1% and the 99%.

Having this sort of populist / anti-wealthy sentiment gaining traction in the galactic south could create all sorts of tension elsewhere in the galaxy: with household servants in the Paradise sector, poor workers in Syndicate space, etc. The Syndicate, in particular, operates similarly to "company towns" in the late 1800s and early 1900s.

### Syndicate Worlds
## These worlds are only defended by small syndicate fleets (17 worlds)

planet Amazon
	attributes core tourism oil frontier
	description `Amazon is a lush, green, tropical world, a popular tourist destination for many who live in this region of space. The indigenous forests are dense and hardy enough that growing human crops here is a constant battle, and none of the native plants or fruits are edible. Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining.`
	description `	The forests are home to a stunning variety of wildlife, some of it dangerous but most of it entirely indifferent to human presence. Plant life is so abundant here that even the oceans are green rather than blue, teeming with kelp and algae.`
	spaceport `The Amazon spaceport is unique, built on top of tall pillars more than fifty meters above the ground, directly above the forest canopy. The landing pads, buildings, and catwalks between them are laid out in a random branching pattern, forming a shape that from above looks almost organic. Directly over the railings, you can see brightly colored birds circling beneath your feet.`

planet Antipode
	attributes core mining frontier
	description `Antipode is a world of creeping glaciers and year-round snow, orbiting far enough from a dim star that even when the sun breaks through the clouds, it brings little warmth. The few settlements that exist here are built near surface deposits of rare earth metals that were discovered recently, and that are mined for use in electronics and equipment throughout this sector.`
	description `	The inhabitants of Antipode are among the best downhill skiers in the galaxy, and they have made some attempts to draw off-world tourists to the ski resorts here, but the weather is so hostile that they have had very little success.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists of a single enormous warehouse. The air inside is cold, but you are glad to get out of the howling wind. In one corner is a counter advertising skiing adventures, but no one is staffing it; they must be out to lunch or taking the day off. As with many of these small spaceports, it seems that the only option for food is a pub, but the smells coming from it are enticing; for once, you may have found a spaceport bar whose chef actually knows how to cook.`

planet Bluestone
	attributes core oil research frontier
	description `The sunlight that filters through Bluestone's atmosphere is too dim and reddish for ordinary Earth plants to thrive. The native plants, mostly grasses and lichens, have adapted their own unique chlorophyll-like molecules in response.`
	description `	Bluestone is sparsely populated. Aside from one small research village dedicated to cultivating edible hybrid crops that can grow on similar worlds, most of the industry here is focused on drilling and refining oil to make a variety of plastics.`
	spaceport `Aside from the metal roofs on a few of the largest warehouses, the spaceport buildings are constructed largely of durable plastic resin, pre-cast into interlocking beams and panels. There is a small pub in the center of the port, with its exterior walls painted a cheerful yellow. All the other buildings are the same red-brown color of the raw plastic.`

planet Burthen
	attributes core mining
	description `Burthen is only sparsely populated due to crushingly high gravity. The locals - exceptionally strong and short - take a stoic pride in this misery and the many health issues that result. The land in most regions is suitable for farming, but mining of heavy metals is the primary industry, and the source of ready wealth that ties people to this uncomfortable planet.`
	description `	Some of the excavation vehicles used here are as large and costly as a capital starship and as noisy as a volcano. Vast scars of strip mines span across the landscape. On this planet the environment is something to be endured rather than cherished.`
	spaceport `You could feel the oppressive force of this planet's gravity as soon as you landed. The spaceport is a small cluster of single-story buildings. More cargo seems to be handled by robotic vehicles than by actual human operators, but the few people walking past you are all much shorter than you are. You feel like a giant, clearly out of place.`

planet Canyon
	attributes core farming frontier
	description `Canyon is a large world, with gravity near the high end of what human beings can comfortably bear. Much of its surface is sandstone, leading scientists to believe that the planet was once home to large oceans, before some cataclysmic event, perhaps a rogue star drifting through the system, caused much of the planet's water to boil away. The few settlers who live here mostly farm the deep canyons; the mesas above are dry and almost lifeless.`
	description `	The angular rock formations that cover most of the mesa land are identified in local mythology as the ruins of an unspeakably vast and ancient alien city. A gullible tourist can find any number of opportunities to tour these alleged sites. Off-world science has been largely skeptical of these claims.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a wide, flat stone field with no individual landing spots marked out; you're simply responsible for finding an unoccupied space large enough for your ship, A half kilometer away from the field is a small village with a marketplace and a pub. There are only a few starships parked here. In the village, you can recognize the locals because of their stout, muscular stature; you are taller than almost everyone here.`

planet "Charybdis Station"
	attributes core station
	description `Charybdis station is privately owned by the Syndicate. It is a massive deuterium refinery, with harvester drones constantly flying in and out to scoop hydrogen gas out of the upper atmosphere of the planet below. If you need to repair or refuel in this system, you will need to visit the neighboring world of Delve, instead of this station.`

planet Crossroads
	attributes core mining
	description `Crossroads is a thoroughly unbeautiful planet. The scrawny local vegetation has blue and purple leaves, shocking to your human eyes, and grows only reluctantly, leaving the land looking like a blighted wasteland.`
	description `	The Syndicate's vast operation strip mining for uranium ore does nothing to improve this situation. They say that sandstorms were frequent here even before the Syndicate arrived, but the storms have gotten far worse in recent years, with some storms now reaching several kilometers high and dozens of kilometers in diameter.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is marked out with radio beacons to allow ships to land or take off even if the air is too dusty to see the ground. The dusty air tastes metallic on your tongue. It is laced with radioactive elements, and you try your best not to breathe in too much of the dust while making your way from your ship to the low stone buildings of the port.`

planet Hippocrates
	attributes core research frontier
	description `Hippocrates is a sparsely settled world, home mostly to scientific research outposts. The environment here, orbiting so close to a red dwarf star, is very different from most other settled planets. The scientists estimate this star system to be over ten billion years old, enough that life here has had much more time to develop and evolve than on any planet orbiting a brighter, more short-lived star.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a single building, and half the landing pads are just packed dirt. This port was not designed for large volumes of cargo or of visitors. Within the building is a sun-lit atrium, with separate storefronts for the commodity exchange, the job center, and the bank. The only place you can see where you might be able to get something to eat is a bar, advertised by a sign showing an Erlenmeyer flask with a folding paper umbrella hung over the rim.`

planet Icefall
	attributes core farming oil frontier
	description `Icefall is far from its sun, but with an axial tilt of roughly 38 degrees. This means that the climate is cold, but the year is also long, and each hemisphere has a short summer - barely enough to fit a terrestrial growing season. There are only a few major towns, and no major metropolitan centers. Most of the inhabitants make a living as farmers, although near the equator there is also some oil drilling industry. Icefall's oceans are filled with constantly shifting pack ice and icebergs, making them nearly unnavigable.`
	description `	The most distinctive feature of the local ecology is the vast flocks of gooselike migratory birds, which raise two broods a year: one in each hemisphere's summer. The farm workers migrate in similar fashion, and many landowners have farms in both hemispheres.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located near the equator, in this world's industrial zone. Along the horizon are fields of pumpjacks and oil derricks. The port consists of rows of hangars, plus two large square towers that house the marketplace and storage space for cargo. A constant howling wind sweeps in between the buildings, but thankfully they are well constructed out of sturdy cement.`

planet "Kraken Station"
	attributes "near earth" station
	description `Kraken Station is seven centuries old; it was the first space station built outside of the Sol system. The station has been modified and repaired so often since that time that in all likelihood not a single deck panel or bulkhead that was part of the original station remains. Four centuries ago it was nearly destroyed by an asteroid impact, but other than that it has been a working deuterium refinery for its entire lifetime.`
	spaceport `The main ring of the station consists of three different levels, with living quarters, repair shops, a few small cafeterias, and even a barber. The lower levels also house some of the refinery equipment, but much of the harvesting is done automatically by robotic drones. For a station that is so old, everything feels surprisingly sturdy; the bolts and beams that make up the station are much thicker than they probably need to be.`

planet Lodestone
	attributes core volcanic mining
	description `Lodestone is a young, volcanically active world. The atmosphere is often filled with choking dust or sulfur dioxide, and new eruptions can occur with hardly any warning. Building any sort of structure here is an exercise in futility.`
	description `	The only reason Lodestone is inhabited is because of the planet's unusually rich reserves of heavy metals and other rare minerals.`
	spaceport `This port is known as "Fourth Port." The previous three ports are partly or completely buried under lava flows. The present port is built on a raised platform a hundred meters above the ground. The steel stilts supporting the platform are intended to keep the port from being buried by any encroaching lava flow. However, given that some explosive eruptions here have been known to launch lava nearly a kilometer into the air, sooner or later Fourth Port will need to be replaced by a fifth.`

planet Nimbus
	attributes core fishing medical
	description `Nimbus is a stormy ocean world, where a rain shower can descend on you almost without warning, only to be replaced with equal suddenness by bright sunshine. It draws mostly the sort of people who can weather such changes with placid, unperturbed calm; tourist guidebooks often rank Nimbus near the top in their lists of "friendliest natives."`
	description `	All the industry on Nimbus is driven by the sea. Fish are plentiful, and the oceans here also contain some unique microorganisms that are harvested to extract useful medical compounds.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is on a small island, but well above the high water mark. The mixture of ocean spray and fog and drizzling rain is enough to turn your clothes damp even just on the short walk from your landing pad to the main cluster of buildings. Thankfully, the weather is warm, but you are glad to find a cozy, dry, and welcoming space in the coffeehouse across from the warehouse district.`

planet "Oberon Station"
	attributes core station
	description `Oberon station is a deuterium refinery owned and operated by the Syndicate, and aside from a few docking bays for visiting ships to use in an emergency, the rest of the station is sealed off to non-employees.`

planet Placer
	attributes core mining frontier
	description `Placer is uninhabited aside from one small mining outpost; the atmosphere contains uncomfortable levels of ammonia and sulfur dioxide, and although brief exposure is not considered a health threat, those who live here must wear breathing gear when they leave their pressurized homes and mine shafts. Several scientific experiments over the last few centuries have sought to introduce microorganisms that would break down the harmful chemicals and transform the atmosphere to make it safer for human beings to breathe, but none have been successful.`
	spaceport `The port consists of a large atmospheric dome, with landing pads and airlocks around the periphery. Although brief exposure to the air is not considered harmful, you find yourself holding your breath as you run from your ship to the airlock. Inside the dome, hanging gardens and open park land create a much more hospitable place, but the spaceport is nearly deserted, aside from one small pub that seems to be full of mine workers whose shift has just ended.`

planet Quicksilver
	attributes core volcanic mining
	description `Quicksilver is a world of highly variable, violent weather: hurricanes, hail, and earth-shaking thunderstorms. Under the planet's crust, it is equally turbulent and unpredictable, leading to frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity.`
	description `	Although Quicksilver has vast mineral resources, the tectonic activity makes underground mining far too dangerous. However, a few enterprising settlers work in surface mining and mountaintop removal. The results are ugly, but this is a far too inhospitable world for anyone to care what it looks like.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a single, enormous hangar built as a geodesic dome. It is filled with the constant dull roar of rain beating against the dome from above. When an especially strong blast of wind strikes the dome, its joints flex slightly and you can see the whole structure ripple and move.`
	spaceport `	Amenities here are minimal: a small cafeteria selling hot drinks and warm stew, and a marketplace mostly filled with stacks of refined steel and aluminum and titanium for sale. A smaller stack of lead-lined crates hold radioactive metals. The air is not particularly cold here, but it is very damp, and the howling weather outside seems to weigh on everyone's spirits.`

planet Sundive
	attributes core farming research frontier
	description `Sundive is largely covered in tropical rainforests and savanna, but with enough open plains that it has also become a major agricultural world. For most of the year, the weather here is quite mild, but tornadoes and massive thunderstorms are not uncommon in the summer months.`
	description `	Sundive is also home to a large astronomical laboratory with radio telescopes and other devices for studying the galactic core and the massive black hole that resides there.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in a wide, open plain; most of the landing sites are just packed dirt. Surrounding it is nothing but farmland and forests; the laboratory and telescopes are far beyond the horizon, where incoming ships will not interfere with their operation.`
	spaceport `	The buildings are short and made of wood; even the roofs are clapboard shingles rather than metal or rubber. Several farmers have brought in goods to sell; most of them came in trucks, but you also see a few horse-drawn wagons.`

planet Trove
	attributes core mining moon
	description `Trove is a tiny moon, too small to have a breathable atmosphere. It is home to an experimental "jack mining" operation that has split is surface open in order to gain access to the metal-rich core. Most of the work here is done by machines, but a few people live inside an airtight complex in order to supervise the work and to sell ore and metal to visiting ships.`
	spaceport `Within the mining complex, you find a small cafeteria with an uninspiring menu, and windows overlooking offices where dozens of people are staring at flickering video screens. Because of the low gravity, everyone moves languidly, as if in a dream. It is nearly silent.`

## These worlds are defended by large syndicate fleets (11 worlds)

planet Delve
	attributes core mining
	description `Delve is a world of towering mountains and valleys so steep that some slopes never see the light of the sun, where snow and ice remain on the topmost peaks year-round. The Syndicate's mining operations here are among the most extensive in the region, with some shafts descending several kilometers below the surface. Some of the mines are as large as a city, and in fact many of the mining cities are under ground, built in sections of old mines that have long since run out of useful metals. With all the mines and underground cities reliant on mechanical ventilation from the surface, the miners live in constant fear of two things: cave-ins, and power failures.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an enormous hollow carved out of the side of a mountain, with a network of steel beams and mesh holding the rock in place. Inside the hollow, the landings are caves carved into the rock itself, again with steel beams above to protect the ships within. A tiered set of cog railways transport passengers and cargo between the landings and the large town at the base of the hollow. Beyond the hollow, the mountainside falls off into a steep cliff and a mist-filled valley below. Although the port is well-built and modern, you cannot help an irrational fear that the whole place will slide off the edge of the mountain one day.`

planet Foundry
	attributes core factory urban
	description `Foundry is home to the Syndicated Shipyards, where more than half of the commercial freighters in human space are manufactured. Although much of the planet is blanketed in smog from the factories, there are also regions of pristine forests and majestic mountains. The Syndicate has a generous vacation policy on Foundry that allows workers to take as much as a month of vacation time every year, and many choose to take that time to escape from the cities and explore the wilderness. The shipyards claim that this vacation time is partly responsible for the high reliability of the ships built here, because a well-rested and relaxed worker is less likely to make the sort of mistakes that can quickly become disastrous in outer space.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is surrounded by kilometers of hangars and factories where new ships are being assembled. The port itself is a trio of towering buildings, with a skywalk on the top floors to provide a view of the surrounding area. Larger ships land on pads on the ground surrounding the towers, while smaller ships can fly into hangars built into the sides of the towers themselves. Everything is made of gleaming metal, and each tower is slightly tapered and adorned with painted fins that make it resemble an enormous starship.`

planet Furnace
	attributes core military moon
	description `Furnace is a nearly uninhabited world, used mostly as a waypoint for shipping and as a staging point for the Syndicate fleets that seek to keep this region of space free from pirates. The atmosphere is barely thick enough to be breathable, and none of the plants that grow here are useful for eating. However, because it is only a large moon instead of a full-sized planet, moving cargo and fleets of ships to and from its surface is fairly easy and inexpensive.`
	description `	Conducting any business here is a nightmare of tedium. Syndicate doctrine claims that corporate structure and process produce a leaner and more effective military force without the perceived wastage of the Republic Navy. But in practice, they seem to have combined all the worst aspects of military and corporate bureaucracy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is mostly a military base. Uniformed crew members hurry back and forth without giving you a second glance. The food in the mess hall is standard military fare, hearty but bland and unappetizing, and there are few shops or other services catering to civilians.`

planet Hephaestus
	attributes core factory urban
	description `Hephaestus is home to Syndicated Systems, which manufactures parts used in shipyards throughout human space. Although not always the highest quality or most technologically advanced, ship outfits produced by the Syndicate are quite affordable and sufficient for any ordinary pilot's needs. The executives of many other companies have been known to make a pilgrimage of sorts to this planet, to witness firsthand how the Syndicate has made their production lines here so efficient and dependable.`
	description `	Nearly all the inhabitants of Hephaestus live in a single metropolitan area that has spread to cover almost an eighth of the total land mass. As with many Syndicate worlds, pollution is a growing problem that they are working hard to address.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists of a double row of hangars of all different sizes, with shops and warehouse space in between. In many of the hangars you pass, mechanics are busy installing new parts or making repairs to old ones. The flash of arc welders and the squeal of bolt drivers and rivet guns is everywhere. Above the hangars is a tier of supply rooms with all different sorts of ship outfits on display, rows and rows of gleaming, identical parts. Robotic gantries swing overhead at frightening speeds, stocking and fetching parts. It serves as both a functional storage space and a massive advertisement for Syndicated equipment.`

planet Maker
	attributes core factory mining
	description `When families or young adults on Earth find themselves stifled by the crowded conditions on humanity's home world, Maker is where many of them end up. The Syndicate offers free transportation and housing in exchange for anyone willing to sign a five years contract to the mines or factories on Maker. The living conditions are often unpleasant, with young men and women packed into dormitories, and with those who are most in need of income taking dangerous jobs in the mines. Five or ten years of work will earn you enough to set up a homestead on any of the frontier worlds, and to many, those years are worth it.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Maker is enormous, but laid out very efficiently. In one sector, a steady stream of passengers, most of them young and dressed somewhat shabbily, are disembarking. They are funneled straight to a labor and immigration center, from which they will be assigned to different factories. Meanwhile, a smaller stream of older, tired-looking but better dressed workers flows in the other direction; people who have finished their terms of service and are boarding ships for other worlds.`
	spaceport `	In the commercial sector of the port, robotic cargo trucks rumble through the streets at frightening speeds, while pedestrians walk from building to building along skyways several stories up.`

planet Millrace
	attributes "near earth" factory urban
	description `Millrace is an overpopulated world, full of factories and manufacturing plants. It is one of several planets in this region of space where people trying to escape from the crowded squalor and polluted cities of Earth come looking for work. Most of the goods manufactured here end up being used by the Syndicate for constructing starships or driving industry on other worlds.`
	description `	The Syndicate is a fair employer: living conditions here may be squalid, but most workers are earning a living wage and some are able to save up for a new life on a more pleasant planet. The Syndicate trusts there will never be a shortage of new immigrants to replace them.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is ugly. As the population of Millrace has grown, the spaceport has been expanded to support the increase immigration; you can recognize the different sections because in the newer ones, the bare cement walls are lighter and have accumulated less soot and grime. Most of the restaurants are of the greasy spoon variety.`

planet Moonshake
	attributes core urban factory
	description `Moonshake is a planet of overpopulated cities side by side with dense wilderness. A few centuries ago it became a local center of industrial production when the Syndicate began building factories here. Since then, immigrants looking for steady work have been pouring in, doubling the planet's population every few decades. It is now a regional center for the production of everything from textiles to molded plastic parts to reactor-grade plutonium.`
	description `	It is characteristic of the Syndicate that the wilderness is entirely ignored, both scientifically and agriculturally, until it is plowed under to make way for expanding industry. Nowhere else in the galaxy is the local fauna so plentiful and yet so poorly characterized.`
	spaceport `The smog is so thick here that you could barely see the landing pad until you were only half a kilometer above it. At street level, the smog is less evident, but the air leaves a faint metallic taste in your mouth. The spaceport, like the rest of this city, is overcrowded, with people walking along the narrow streets and trying to thread their way in between large cargo trucks loaded with crates. You see signs for restaurants of every variety imaginable, but most of them look dirty and dimly lit.`

planet Reunion
	attributes "near earth" urban factory
	description `Reunion is one of the most Earth-like planets found by the early settlers, all the way down to its moon and tides. It has grown into a mostly urban world, which supplies manufactured goods of all sorts to the neighboring systems.`
	description `	Local politics are unusually lively for a Republic world, to the point where a seat in the local legislature is often more hotly contested than one in the Republic Parliament. Topics of debate include trade and taxation, of course, but also seemingly fringe issues like biodiversity regulations for city green space. It may be that a world with no terraforming needs is focusing instead on tweaking society itself.`
	spaceport `The spaceport, although designed as a clean and modern building, is a place of barely controlled chaos: vendors selling food on the sides of the hallways, tourist families with young children, and even a few farmers driving cattle. People of every age and race and occupation rub shoulders here, but there is no sign of the extreme sort of poverty that you have seen on some other worlds.`

planet Shangri-La
	attributes core rich urban frontier
	description `Named after a mythical paradise, Shangri-La is an almost ideal planet, with a mixture of advanced, developed cities and uninhabited mountains. It is a rich and prosperous world, and nearly self-sufficient, but the cost of living here is prohibitively high for anyone from off-world. Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is state-of-the-art. So are the laser turrets and missile silos spaced out along its periphery. But somehow, instead of making you feel more secure, the defenses only serve to remind you of how far on the fringes of civilization you are, and of how rich this planet is compared to some of its neighbors. Everyone walking through the port is moving at a brisk, purposeful pace; loitering and sightseeing are not encouraged here.`

planet Sunracer
	attributes core urban factory farming fishing frontier
	description `Sunracer is home of Megaparsec, Inc., a shipyard that specializes in designing fast, lightweight ships. It is a well-settled planet with a population of nearly half a billion, and a diverse economy that includes farming and fishing in addition to the shipyards.`
	description `	Outside the cities, large regions of undeveloped land still remain. Hovercraft racing is a major local sport, and some massive and elaborate courses have been constructed in the wilderness.`
	spaceport `On Sunracer, the spaceport and shipyard are one and the same. As you walk among the landing pads and hangars, it is not immediately clear which ships are visiting starships undergoing minor repairs, and which are new ones under construction. A series of enormous cranes tower over one section of landing pads. From them hang hull fragments, engines, and even a few small ships, each being swung from one location within the shipyard to another. Meanwhile, forklifts and flatbed trucks are weaving between the buildings in every direction.`

planet Tinker
	attributes "near earth" factory mining
	description `Tinker is a highly industrialized world, exporting electronics both to the Syndicate and to Earth. The electronic goods manufactured here span the gamut from wires and capacitors to sophisticated microchips, and because many of the jobs here require skilled labor, it is a relatively prosperous planet.`
	description `	Outside the cities, large areas of this world have been set aside for mining and for refineries and smelters, ensuring that the industries here have all the raw materials they need, plus extra to sell.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is nearly five hundred years old. As with many ports from that era, it is constructed as a single large complex, a towering building with hangar bay openings on all levels and a dedicated crew of flight controllers directing incoming starships in order to avoid collisions. Around the spaceport a city has developed.`

### Mentions of the Syndicate in the Free World campaign

### Intro

mission "FW Katya 2B" (Intro)
	`	"I go from world to world checking out plant emissions, to see if they're leaking isotopes into the air, the sea, or the groundwater. And if they are I sic the Department of Atomic Safety on them. The Syndicate hates my guts right now."`
	- Ijs "Eyes" Springborn


mission "FW Katya 3" (Intro)
			`	"Well," she says, "it started when the Syndicate began experimenting with fully automated mining facilities on uninhabitable planets. Pirates started raiding the mines to steal equipment, and the Syndicate claimed that these installations were 'colonies' and it was the Navy's job to defend them. The Act was Parliament's response, stating that taking goods from a human being is piracy, but if the owner or some living representative of theirs is not present in system, taking those goods is a legal salvage operation. The point was to keep the Navy from being obligated to defend every equipment cache or abandoned station in the galaxy. But by the same law, those Navy surveillance drones become abandoned goods the moment their motherships leave the system."`

I won't describe what the 'checkup' involved, but it was bewildering and unpleasant. And nearly all those girls disappeared, that day. They never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. Most of the leftovers were girls who had been unlucky enough to already be pregnant at that age. Or lucky, as it turned out. But I didn't understand why they didn't take me."`
			`	Alondo seems very disturbed by the story. "They were selling girls into prostitution?" he says.`
			`	"That's what we assumed," she says, "but there were dozens of girls like me who were not taken, even though we were not pregnant. It didn't make sense. Anyway, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the slaver fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the girls were being kept. But the facility was rigged to self-destruct, and they never found out what had been going on inside the facility. No one inside it survived."`

We were all infertile. Had been already, the day of the Disappearance. Which means that either a bunch of pirates had suddenly decided they wanted to leave behind their lives of crime and settle down and raise families... or those girls were being used as incubators."`
			`	Alondo says, "I hear that was common during the Alpha wars. Alpha genetics were so unstable, they needed hundreds of test subjects to produce a handful of viable Alpha babies. Those were evil days."`
			`	"Days that may yet return," she says. "Somewhere, maybe even nearby on Bloodsea or Greenrock or Albatross, the remnants of the Alphas may still be hiding. Creatures bred to be strong and clever and able to kill without a hint of remorse. And now that this sector of space is yours, the duty of defending against them becomes yours, as well. That is why I agree to talk with you: to warn you of that reality."`

They do not know where the defector landed, but they say they will destroy whatever settlement is harboring him unless he is returned to them immediately."`
		`	After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds was innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`

	`	Back at the spaceport, you meet up with Raven. "Here's the deal," she says.

From the perspective of someone who values economic growth above all else, war was a better alternative than recession."`
	`	"That's utter nonsense," says the man. "That's the sort of absurd conspiracy theory that someone with no understanding of business would invent."`
	`	The rest of the hearing is little better, but as you are leaving one of the representatives from the Deep shakes your hand, and you feel a piece of paper being pressed into your palm. You pocket it quietly and open it once you have returned to your ship. It says, "Visit us on Valhalla."`

There, he introduces you to several other regional governors and authorities.`
	`	"You may be aware," Edrick says, "that the Deep was self-governing before the formation of the Republic. Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe.

Such an action would satisfy the technical requirements of legality provided that immediately prior to the arrest, one of our courts hears Sawyer's testimony and pronounces that Syndicate individual guilty."`

	`	Ijs laughs at that. "Relax, Captain. I've been doing 'technically legal' stuff for years. It only occasionally goes disastrously wrong. But governor, if the Syndicate sees you coming, you'll need a full-scale war fleet, not just a handful of ships."`

	`	"That's why the fleet will be composed of ships from three different organizations," says Edrick. "You will find a reason to travel to Earth with perhaps one of your fancy new Dreadnoughts as an escort. When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`
	`	"We'd need to know exactly where and on what planet our target lives, prior to entering Syndicate space," says Katya. "And, if you want to have a court trial immediately prior to the arrest, it sounds like Sawyer will need to stay here."`
	`	"Indeed," says Edrick, "but I assure you, he is safer from the Syndicate here than anywhere else in human space, your own territory included. As for locating a target, that's why the Oathkeepers have requested that you visit them on Farpoint."`

mission "FW Reconciliation 2B"
	`	Raven says, "Governor Edrick mentioned a plan for tracking down the Syndicate executives who were behind the attacks in the Castor and Pollux systems."`
	`	"Indeed," says Danforth. "Southeast of here is a region of uninhabited star systems, a sort of back entrance into Syndicate space. Few ships travel through there, because there is nowhere to refuel, but with a ramscoop or enough fuel capacity, travel is possible. One of the first inhabited worlds on the other side is the lawless world of Stormhold. There, you can surely find a contact who knows enough about the inner workings of the Syndicate to tell you the home of at least a few of our targets... for a price." He hands Katya a large stack of credit chips.`

mission "FW Reconciliation 2C"
	`You land near one of the small villages on Stormhold, and after handing out a few small bribes from the money Danforth gave you, finally one of the villagers recalls that a local gang of pirates is led by a former Syndicate manager. With some trepidation, you fly to his stronghold, and he agrees to "do business" with you.`
	`	Katya shows him Sawyer's list of names. "So, these are the bad boys, huh?" he says. Clearly the news of Sawyer's revelations has spread even to this remote world. He looks through the list, and is able to tell you where three of the five men live. "I'd love to see all these bastards taken down," he says.`
	`	You give him the rest of Danforth's money and thank him for helping you - and ask that he keep your visit secret. "No problem," he says. As you are leaving, he adds, "Also, Mister Springborn... you're my hero, man. Glad you're still finding ways to pester the Syndicate." Ijs seems pleasantly surprised to be recognized.`

mission "FW Defend Farpoint"
	`When you land back on Farpoint, Danforth eagerly meets you and asks what information you were able to obtain. You tell him. "So," he says, "one executive on Foundry, and one on Hephaestus. Both of those are core Syndicate planets, with billions of people on them. No way that would work. But this financial guy, Alexander Soylent... your contact says he lives on a giant yacht that sails around the ocean on Nimbus. Now, that's a much more inviting target. And from what Sawyer says, the Syndicate's financial arm were the ones who decided war would be beneficial in the first place."`

mission "FW Reconciliation Break"
	`	Alondo says, "We should use this time of peace well, to prepare for another battle ahead. Those Syndicate ships on New Tibet had equipment I've never seen before, and who knows what else the Syndicate has up their sleeves - especially if they've begun producing nuclear weapons. Captain <last>, you should take this time to make sure your ship is as well armed as possible for our next strike. Ijs and Katya, what will you do with this time?"`

You tell him about your narrow escape from Syndicate space, and the fact that the Syndicate used nuclear weapons against your fleet, in violation of the rules of war that humankind has abided by for centuries.`
	`	"Unfortunately," says Edrick, "all the other witnesses to that event were allied with the Syndicate, so people will believe whatever they want to believe. Already the Syndicate is spreading stories about a renegade fleet of rebels and extremists that attacked one of their worlds in an assassination attempt on one of their leaders. Worse, they've taken this as an excuse to send a massive Syndicate fleet to the Sol system - to defend Earth from attack, they say."`

Then, more recently, the Syndicate fleet that had been occupying the Sol system retreated to Syndicate space - and the moment the last of their ships left, the hyperspace link disappeared behind them.

	`	"How do you know this?" asks Alondo.`
	`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`

So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`

		`	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
			goto deal
		`	"Wait, you're saying that your fleet that was in orbit around Earth... was armed with nuclear weapons? Are you genocidal?"`
			
	`	Alastair seems like the kind of person who seldom admits he is wrong, but your question definitely flusters him. "Okay, okay, I admit, we've been making one bad decision after another ever since... well, since that first bad decision. It just got out of control. We thought the Navy was going to raid us and put us all behind bars. We thought we needed a deterrent. It was stupid. I admit it, okay? Now please, let's just move on. We need your capital ships, and you need our jump drives."`

	`	"Hold on," says Alondo, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
	`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`

Freya whispers to you, "Just think of this as another step toward peace and reconciliation."`
	`	The new shipyard is some distance away from the old one, which is still in ruins, a radioactive crater a few kilometers away from the spaceport. "The attack happened at night," says the supervisor. "Three hundred and forty-seven people were killed. If the attack had been during working hours, that number would have been in the thousands. We're recovering some metal from the old shipyard, but other than that it's a total loss. The radiation is slowly dying down, though."`
	`	There is deep anger in his voice as he speaks. You are glad that the Free Worlds have been proved innocent of involvement in the attack, but you suspect that on the worlds that were bombed, most people will not accept peace with the Syndicate on any terms except the full surrender of all the Syndicate personnel who were responsible.`

You ask if he can send a courier ship to Earth to inform them of the new situation, to have them begin massing a fleet there. He agrees. He also tells you that a few of the Syndicate ships that met you in orbit have been designated as additions to your attack fleet, so they will be traveling back to Maker with you if the reflector succeeds in reopening the link.`

But the Oracle gave us a way to predict the future, for everything from supply chain management to stock trading to the commodities market."`

We even asked the Oracle if dissolving the Syndicate would avert the recession. But its predictions remained the same. Then we learned from our contacts in Parliament about the Southern Defense Pact, and the fear that they were about to declare independence. So we asked the Oracle what would happen if war broke out."`

	`Soon after you land, more Navy ships begin pouring into the system, including Admiral Danforth's own cruiser. Navy soldiers and ships are scouring the whole surface of the planet; there is very little chance that any of the Alphas who remain here will be able to escape their detection. Admiral Danforth meets with you and Freya and thanks you for providing the decoy that kept his own ships from bearing the brunt of the Alphas' nuclear arsenal.`
	`	"Do you need us to do anything more here?" asks Freya.`
	`	"No," he says, "and I hear that Parliament wants to speak with you, Captain <last>. Something about an official commendation for your part in the battle against the Pug, I think. Meanwhile, this may not be the end of our trouble with the Syndicate, but at least it's a good start. It's been an honor to fight alongside you."`

	`	"What, does peace and reconciliation sound boring to you?" he says. "Don't worry about that. With that jump drive installed in your ship, the whole galaxy is open to you. Who knows what you might discover beyond the boundaries of human space?"`

	`	You return to your ship, and prepare for the journey back to Earth, hopeful that at last Parliament will be willing to negotiate a permanent peace with the Free Worlds.`

	`On Earth, you return to something of a hero's welcome, far different from the first time you were here on a diplomatic mission. A crowd of locals gathers in the spaceport to watch your ship land. With the Free Worlds having been instrumental in defeating the aliens, and absolved of any guilt in the terrorist attacks, it seems that most people here are ready to see you as a hero rather than a criminal.`
	`	You discover that Parliament has made a treaty with the Free Worlds, agreeing that the Free Worlds will be allowed autonomy in the region they currently control as long as they do not seek to expand their territory further. As of now, your war against the Republic is officially over.`
	`	Your meeting with Parliament is long and grueling, as they press you and Freya for every detail you can give them about the enigmatic Pug and their apparent motivation in invading human space. The questions about the Syndicate are equally hard to answer. But at the end of the session, one of the members of Parliament informs you that they have authorized an official commendation for you, along with a reward of five million credits "to cover any of your expenses from fighting the aliens, and to help you integrate back into civilian life."`
	`	The war is over; your work for the Free Worlds is at an end. What you do next is up to you...`

### Epilogue

mission "FW Epilogue: Danforth"
		`	Danforth is quite excited to see you. "Captain <last>!" he says. "So good to see you back up here in my neck of the woods again. It's funny, you'd think that with the war over they'd just dissolve the Oathkeepers, since the whole Republic is at peace with the Free Worlds and there's no longer any oath left for us to keep. But, the Oathkeepers became so well known for our role against the Pug and the Syndicate that now everyone wants to join our division."`
		`	"Are the pirates giving you any trouble?" you ask.`
		`	"A bit," he says. "We still have far too many pirates in this sector, in part due to the Free Worlds driving them out of the south. The pirates grew stronger and more bold as the war dragged on, when all our fleets were busy elsewhere, but now we're beginning to get them under control again."`
		`	Then he leans forward and says, more quietly, "Of course, you and I both know the pirates aren't the main threat. Raven is off infiltrating Syndicate worlds even as we speak, and several of my other best intelligence officers, too. The Syndicate wants us to believe that they've weeded out all the rotten apples from their ranks, but we're keeping an eye on them, all the same."`
