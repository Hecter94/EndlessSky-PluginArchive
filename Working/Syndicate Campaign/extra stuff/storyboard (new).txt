Post-bombing main string: Meet and help Sal, a Syndicate fixer and contractor, who is dealing with some shady business.
	1) Run into Sal while in a spaceport and he asks you to transport something from the Deep to the Syndicate. The pay is rather large and the way he describes it seems off, so the player is able to decline without consequence. 
	2) Arrive in the Deep to have the cargo loaded. Get stopped by a DS Guard and questioned about what you're doing. Be allowed to go on your way. Speak with Sal on return.
	3 + alt) Sal wants you to transport a few friends of his friends to a frontier world. Followed by a Syndicate ship.
	4) After landing with the "friends", they board another ship and make their way toward the pirate worlds. Sal wants you back on some other world.
	5) Notice someone sneaking around the spaceport when Sal shows up, late, and pulls your attention away. Look back and the stranger is gone. Sal wants you to scan the cargo of a ship that's about to leave, then land on the planet once you're done. Scan the ship and it has nuclear testing equipment. On return to Foundry to Sal's private hangar, Sal says he's trying to find out who's behind the bombings and thinks who you just scanned has something to do with it. "Get out of my hangar and meet me in the spaceport. I don't enjoy having guests here for too long."
	6) Meet with Sal in the hangar and he bad mouths the FW. "It's probably them. Innocent until proven guilty and all, you know. No one has any hard proof and the Navy's too afraid to pull the trigger and find it." Sal asks you to bring him to a nearby pirate world so that he can speak with his "contacts".
	7) Sal brings you to a island complex on Deadman's Cove because he wants you to stick near him and make sure you're fine. Bump into a pirate, he pulls a knife and looks at you, he looks at Sal and puts the knife away, then says "Be careful who you associate with, punk." Sal speaks with contact who says how everyone's loving the situation because of how the Navy are disoriented. "This'll be great for business." "I'm sure it will be for scum like you." They both laugh. "Now get off my island!" the warlord says as he motions to his men to remove you, still laughing along with Sal. On return in a private hangar of Sal's, he speak with the CEO.
	8) The CEO suggests speaking with more warlords. Sal explains to the player how most pirates may be anarchists and not give two shits about what the Syndicate wants, but Sal is the Syndicate's main contact to the major pirate warlords. He makes a joke about the last guy he had to bring him places looking at a warlord wrong and being shot, then laughs it off and suggest you go to Stormhold to have a chat with another warlord.
	9) Chat with a warlord on Stormhold. This warlord says they have a rat in the Navy giving them some intersting information about the possible origins of the nukes. Also suggests checking Covert and Bucanneer Bay, but Sal mentions how the last time he spoke with the warlords down there they said they'd kill him if he ever showed back up. Player does something that they shouldn't, and as you leave Sal looks you dead in the eyes and says he wasn't joking about the person before you that died. Land back on a Syndicate world where Sal says he needs to do some work in the Paradise Worlds.
	10) Land on Glory. Meet some plastic surgeried moneybags pissed about the Navy spreading out more. Moneybags gives a sealed box to Sal, which isn't explained to the player.
	11) Land on Prime to meet a "business associate" in private.
	12) Land on Hestia for Sal to meet an "old friend." Sal makes a joke about thinking of retiring there. Get word of needing to pick something up on Geminus.
	13) Pick something up from Geminus; Sal refuses to leave the ship and tells you where to find the pickup point, which is a box marked radioactive. Return it to a Syndicate world.
	14) Sal wants you to bring him back to Stormhold to have a chat with the warlord again.
	15) Sal is pulled off of your ship as soon as the doors open. "Not like this. Think of all the good I've done you boys." The pirates tell you to get back and leave. Try and save Sal and you die. Leave and as you try to get out of there quick, you hear a number of shots go off. Sal "dies" off screen. Launch.

Syndicate commitment
	Having met with multiple Syndicate employees or afiliated people and learning a bit about how the Syndicate works, decide to apply for the Syndicate. Only one available job opening that isn't factory work: Syndicated Communications. 
	
	
	
____________ Start: Communications ______________
# Syndicated Communications: more diplomatic and directly involved in the dealings that the Syndicate has with the Free Worlds (you get to meet Alondo) and Republic. Probably going to have a situation where you fly through a warzone and get shot at by some trigger happy FW interceptors. Maybe even involve coming into contact with the Hai. Will focus on passenger missions, but might also have combat in the form of fighting bounty hunters. Probably won't deal with the Korath Raiders (but might hear about them). 

Major plot points:
	* Syndicate supporting both sides of the war
	* Deal with drop in migration to Syndicate factory worlds caused by the war
	* Syndicate speaks with Megaparsec about creation of new ship(s) or cheaper ships for the Syndicate
	* Remington investigate disappearance of Sal

The Breakout of War - Player learns about the situation of the Navy attacking the FW, and helps to make preperations for the war's continuation.
	1. The player is contacted about getting the job; told to travel to some planet. [Travel]
	2. Find Remington at said planet. Receive word that the FW and Navy have started fighting. Bring Nate to a meeting on Foundry. [Transport]
	3. Learn about what occured in Kornephoros, get word of the capture of Katya. 
	4. With the war now ongoing, the Syndicate has some work to do. Accompany Remington to a private ceremony where the Syndicate reveals their new autonamous ships. Unlike the plans for the Syndicated Security variant of this mission, have this occur within the Syndicate instead of within the Paradise Worlds, showing them to various bigwigs from around the galaxy. The Paradise Worlds tour would be more of a public showing of these ships, designed to sway the people of the Paradise Worlds. End up getting attacked by pirates and help fend them off alongside the autonamous ships. Meet some important Syndicated Shipyards character. Two or three missions. [escort, combat]
	5. The Free Worlds reach out to the Syndicate; accompany Remington to a meeting, which is the one where Alondo and the player would have come to the Syndicate for diplomacy. [Transport]
	6. With FW-Syndi ties made, bring Remington to the Republic to discuss the Syndicate supporting them and the Navy; Remington makes deal where Syndicate will supply ships to the Navy (reason for appearance of Navy Protectors). Like 3 missions. [Transport]
Internal Politics - The player deals more with the internal workings of the Syndicate, bolstering the Syndicate's strength.
	7. Return to worrying about home base; the fear caused by the war has dropped migration numbers to factory worlds ever since the bombing. Bring Nate to some major Syndicate world to discuss this. [Transport]
	8. Continue the work from the intro of building up frontier worlds; making frontier worlds better places increases the cost of moving there, therefore keeping more workers in the factories longer. "We can't just force them to stay! That'd be a breach of contract." Five missions or so working with frontier worlds, bringing supplies and defending from pirates. [Transport/Cargo/Combat/Escort]
	9. With less workers leaving, now get more workers to show up. Travel to urban Republic worlds to advertise for the Syndicate. Three or four misions doing this, including escorting ships of new workers back to the Syndicate. [Transport/Escort]
	10. Now travel to Megaparsec to speak with them; make a deal about buiding a new ship (the Prospector). Megaparsec also promises to provide ships at a discount to the Syndicate, helping to build up their fleets. Help bring supplies to Megaparsec for the building of the new ship. Fight off pirates. Say three missions. [Transport/Cargo/Combat/Escort]
	11. Megaparsec have to deal with raids from Stormhold; travel to Stormhold to negotiate. Say two missions, involving fighting pirates that refuse to negotiate. Remington calls in Syndicated Security to deal with it. You hand the issue off to them. Start spotting Prospectors among security fleets. [Transport/Combat]
Disappearance of Sal - With work done, help Remington to track down what happened to Sal... or don't.
	12. Having visited the pirate world, Nate thinks about Sal. Asks you about what happened. [Transport]
	13. Travel to Deadman's Cove. Speak with Alvice about what happened. Alvice doesn't budge, claiming he needs work done first. Storyline branches depending on if player does the work for Alvice or not, doing the work being bad karma. Nate mentions how there's some work that the Syndicate need done elsewhere, but he can get some grunts to do it if you decide to accept Alvice's offer. [Transport]
		Nate leaves the choice up to you. "You were there when he got dragged off. I can't believe Alvice would've had him killed, but if you were there and saw it then I'll believe you."
	14a. Do 7 or 8 jobs for Alvice, giving the player bad karma but letting them in on Sal's fate. Involve flying pirate colors for a bit. Deal with Alvice's friends in the far north.
		15. Despite the outbreak of war making things much easier for pirate activities, Alvice's influence can only spread so far. He had a deal with a warlord in the North to transport weapons and illicit goods to the Core, but the shipment never showed up. Travel to the North to find out what happened. [Transport]
		16. While in the North, you talk to some new pirate character. This character mentions something to you about the Syndicate paying off pirates, but Remington doesn't seem to react to the accusation. After asking what happened, this character tells you that the Navy still has a strong hold on the area, and the shipment that was suppose to reach the Core was apprehended. He asks you if you could distract the Navy for him so that the ships can get through, and he pulls out a container of red paint. [Transport]
			If the player agrees, they paint their ship red, essentially become a pirate for a bit, and continue this string.
			If the player disagrees, you leave, return to Alvice, and make up some BS about not being able to finish the job. Alvice keeps his mouth shut about Sal, and the player hops back on to the other branch of missions as if they'd refused Alvice's offer.
		17. The player attacks a small Navy patrol in one of the uninhabited systems. They return to one of the pirate worlds, only to find that the Navy has send a strike force in retaliation. Fend off the Navy fleet with the help of some pirates. Two or so missions. [combat]
		18. Upon defeating the Navy, you return to Alvice's "friend," and he tells you how most of the ships made it through, but there's a few that hadn't gotten off the ground because his crew was slacking. Escort the remaining ships back to the Core, still in pirate colors. [escort]
		19. When you return to the Core, you find that the Syndicate aren't firing on you or your escorts (but you might spot them firing on normal pirates). You get the rest of the shipment to Alvice, for which he thanks you. To your surprise, he tells you that he knows nothing of Sal's status or whereabouts, despite having acted as though he did. He tosses you some spare credits for helping him. You repaint your ship purple and leave.
	14b. Refuse Alvice's offer. Do 7 or 8 missions for the Syndicate instead. Have these missions deal more with other characters as oppose to always having Nate with you. 
		15. Nate mentions needing to stop by another pirate planet nearby (probably the southern Core ones), so you bring him there. There he picks up his Arrow from "the shop," now a Marauder Arrow. Spot MMK's Fury parked nearby. [Escort]
		16. Return to Megaparsec and get an up close look at a Prospector. There you meet with Hensley, who tells you that the pirates attacking Megaparsec have been "dealt with." Part ways with Nate as he needs to deal with some "sensitive matters."
		17. Escort a couple Prospectors to Hephaestus, where you see Syndicated Shipyards making upgrades to the shipyard to fit such a massive ship. Also spot a bulk freighter with some drones being lifted into it, foreshadowing the use of the Class-C Freighter. [Escort]
		18. You're contacted about how the FW have requested parts for a deuterium refinery. Pick up the parts.
		19. Bring the refinery parts to Tundra for the FW to pick up. The player ends up saying exactly what the Syndicate employee says from the FW perspective. Return to Syndicate space. [cargo]
	20. Nate hears about a spy in the FW that's gone cold. Tells you he needs to deal with it. Break in the storyline.
	21. When Nate contacts you again, tells you about your "promotion." Given choice of which middle branch to go into next.
	
	
	
____________ Middle: Military ______________



________________ End: Defector __________________
# Defector: The player is lead to believe that most of the Syndicate is part of the extremist faction and defects with Sawyer, fighting off the extremists who come after him. The player ends up personally meeting members of the Free Worlds and Navy and essentially plays along a merged branch. Given that the player makes sure the defector gets to the FW alive, they have a means of showing their innocence and the FW don't use nukes; FW go Reconciliation

_______________ End: Extremist __________________
# Extremist: The player decides to go after the defector and successfully returns him. From there it is a matter of making sure the Free Worlds are framed for the bombings and that no ties to the Syndicate are ever found. Because the player kills the defector, the FW can not prove its innocence and must turn to using nukes, so the FW go Checkmate.
