# Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky, v0.4

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

## Current status

Main story and most side-things, complete. This will take you up to the end of the civil war, all completed and ready to continue the game as if you'd completed the main-game story.

Remaining: logs on all the events; a few more epilogue conversations; and various hopefully-minor issues, both discovered and undiscovered.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky. You probably already know how. If not, let me know, and I'll get round to updating this readme with the instructions.

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the continuous build in the main Endless Sky project.

- Changes to the Korath have impacted this plugin. The current version tracks the current git repository for endless sky. (2022-09-04)
