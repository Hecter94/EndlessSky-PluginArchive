	description "As is traditional with the Sestor's fighters, the upgrades to the Pai Lek included a doubling of its available firepower. Cramming two detainers into a small package like the Pai Lek was only made possible by the reduction of the detainer's size during earlier technological development."
	description "In addition to enhanced firepower, the upgraded model features greater energy generation and superior mobility, allowing it to direct its powerful long range fire where it's needed most."
