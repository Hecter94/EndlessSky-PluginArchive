	description "This tiny model of Wanderer engines is intended for use on the smallest of ships. Ships unable to fit dedicated propulsion and steering systems can now take advantage of the unusual cooling behavior of Wanderer engines."

	description "This massive engine was designed by the Wanderers to replace the weaker engines used on their heavy warships. Like all Wanderer engines, its incredibly efficient design allows it to double as an unusual alternative to classical cooling systems."

	description "This large steering system provides great turning force for any Wanderer warship with enough engine capacity to carry it. It is powerful enough to spin most ships around with ease, and, at the same time, is also so efficient that it can actually cool a ship carrying it even while it is firing, as with its smaller siblings."
