	description "This robotic drone serves as a cargo and fuel transport for R2 however it is entirly capable of autonamous operation for however long it needs. Since it is designed to harvest minerals from asteroids it has very large thrusters compared to it's steering. This is one of R2's auxiliary ships so is much more on human scale than their habitats."
