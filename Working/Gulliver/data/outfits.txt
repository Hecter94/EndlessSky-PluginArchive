	description "The R2 Utility shipâ€™s ramscoop generates enormous electromagnetic fields that progressively constricts to compress and collect loose stellar mass. The ramscoops operates with greatest efficiency when R2 Utility Ships are deployed to skim the corona of the stellar object or after the stellar object has already ejected sufficiently large quantities of material after supernova. When the R2 Utility ship is inevitably confronted by hostile assailants, the ramscoop can be re-calibrated to instead compress and fire an intense stream of super heated plasma to incinerate the hulls of any ship in range."
