Add that add various modded ships to vanilla fleets to add more variety to the space.

Based on 250 mods from the archive. (https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive)

INFO:
<name> fleets.txt add ships that never got added to fleets
<name> patch.txt add ships that is added on its own plugin but with events to circumvent (likely accidental) override from other plugins, can be removed if already working correctly before this. Else might cause these fleets to be more common than it should.
