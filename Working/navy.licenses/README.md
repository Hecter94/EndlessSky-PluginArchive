Adds a mission on Stormhold (Alcyone system) which leads you to Geminus (Castor system) to buy the four Navy licenses.<br>
<br>
The mission can get started with 550,000 credits cash available. You have to pay 50,000 credits for making the contact and 500,000 credits for each of the four licenses.<br>
If you reject the mission, you can restart it on other visits. Also not buying all licenses lets the buying mission on Geminus restart on other landings (until all are bought).<br>
You get the following licenses: Navy license, Navy Auxiliary license, Navy Cruiser license, Navy Carrier license.<br>
