# Prometheus-Flame
A content expansion plugin that aims to overhaul the campaign and human content in general to make it relevant for mid and late game while introducing new ships, factions and storylines fleshing out the world of Endless Sky. It introduces a new corporation: "Paradeigm AT Group", a major player in the periphery which became vital to the Free Worlds war effort and later the development of human civilization.
