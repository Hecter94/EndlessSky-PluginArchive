# Epsil Notes: the main themes that I got for the Southern Rim's new ships are that they are bulky to withstand pirate attacks, modular since many of the designs were converted from civilian ones to speed up development.


# ANTI-MISSILES
# Based on Zoura's ideas from HSO.
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles. 
# Epsil Notes: I will retain the Tarazed origin, they will become available when war starts as imports will be cut, giving impetus to the creation of this anti-missile.

	description "The inability to import Anti-Missile Turrets from Lovelace Labs without heavy duties has forced the Southern Defense Pact to develop a local anti-missile system, so that they can more easily protect southern merchant convoys from ever-increasing pirate attacks. Drawing from the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

# WEAPONS
# Before the war, Paradeigm already experimented with weaponry, like the Syndicate, wanting to have a equivalent for the Navy Particle cannon. Unlike the Syndicate though, they don't have ships large enough to accommodate them so instead they aim to replace energy blasters. Their guns will be somewhat weaker than the Hai Pulse Cannon but will have disruption in exchange.
# Currently they are not very useful against shields which is why I have piercing, but the weapons will need balancing to be somewhat useful by themselves.
# In talks with plugin-chat I got the idea to make the Meson a shield disruptor instead of piercer and the Kisat a hull shredder.
# after more analysis, I decided to make this weapon a miniaturized ion cannon.

	description "Developed as a competitor to the Deep's lasers, Mesron Phasers were designed to destroy efficiently in the smallest package possible. They work by accelerating a packet of protons and electrons trough metal sheets, creating an pulsed beam of subatomic particles (called a Pulsed 'Laser' Cannon) launched at sub-light velocities into enemy vessels."
	description "	While they cannot do much damage by themselves, the ability to disrupt electronics of ships paired with their compact size makes them a powerful weapon, when used in conjunction with other more lethal armaments."
