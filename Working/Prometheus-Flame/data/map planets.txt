	description "Phenyria is on the far edge of Alniyat's habitable zone. Although that means its climate is very Earth-like, it is much colder even at the equator. Despite this, Phenyria is home to just over a hundred and ninety million people from all regions of space, and thanks to its vast resources, it is a major industrial and scientific hub in the South."
	description "	The largest industries on the planet include Paradeigm Group, who employ a tenth of the world's population, and Ikaros Engineering, who develop and manufacture all kinds of outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located inside the main city near the government house, and is divided into two 'rings.' The innermost ring is the oldest, built when the planet was first discovered. Although it was once well trafficked, now it isn't capable of servicing most modern freighters and only processes smaller starships; the oldest facilities are closed off and is in the process of being converted into a museum. The outermost ring, built a hundred years ago, is one of the largest spaceports in the South, handling everything from massive food-laden bulk freighters to shipbuilding and engineering convoys."
	spaceport "	Just outside the planetary spaceport, there is a private port owned by Paradeigm. Occasionally it's possible to see bright flashes inside one of the hangars."

	description "Ilmyria is the first moon of Phenyria and the only one that humans can inhabit. When the South was initially settled, Ilmyria was used as a stopover for repairing ships in long hauls; throughout the ages the colony found new life as a tourist destination and education center, especially for the developing middle class of the Dirt Belt and beyond. As such, more than half of its residents are off-world students. Today the moon is home to various ski resorts, mountain climbing and winter homes, courtesy of the local government who provides substantial benefits to workers as well as large universities which attract many to learn."
	description "	In addition to the overarching education industry, Ilmyria also houses the headquarters of Ikaros Engineering."
	spaceport "Although not outdated in any sense, the spaceport has a distinctive vintage style from the early days of exploration. The main terminal is littered with advertisements for many resorts and schools in the zone and many buses come and go from the terminal. The port is located some kilometers of the main settlement, which resembles the alpine villages that you would see in antique movies. Just outside the the village there is a large campus, where students gain their qualifications for the many industries in the system."

	description "During the early days of space exploration, it was believed that Nymbu was an Earth-like world, and so it was a prime target for early colonization efforts in the Southern Rim. But later atmospheric analysis showed that it was closer to Venus in its composition, and so the colony ship sent to settle Nymbu was redirected to assist in the settlement of its icier brother, Phenyria."
	description "	While the cloudy world was ignored for most of of the system's history, when the first caravans from the Deep arrived in the 2600s there was a qualitative jump in industrial capacity, to the point that a new attempt was made to colonize Nymbu. A new model of colony ship named the 'Cloud City' was constructed to settle Nymbu, and it remains the first and only colony established here. Nymbu is also famous for hosting the Strato GX, a racing competition across the planet."
	spaceport "The port consists of a spire located in the center of Cloud City. Most ships dock on the outside, but larger ships enter at the base where it has more space; some don't even land, but just dump their cargo for the port's drones to pick them up."
	spaceport "	At the center of the spire is a elevator that takes you to the more recreational, commercial and business areas. A few people are using the upper floors to do attempt some skygliding, a popular sport in this cloudy world."

	description "Austral is a quiet, Earth-like world with a single large continent and a few islands surrounded by ocean. Its first settlers, wanting to escape the crowdedness that plagued Earth, scattered across the continent and established thousands of small independent villages, instead of large urban centers that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	Being an idyllic agrarian world, Austral is a popular retirement destination, with a population recently reaching a hundred million inhabitants. Due to the planet's remoteness and the decentralized nature of the settlements, most Austral villages are not shown on local maps of the planet. This makes Austral a perfect hideout for wanted individuals across the galaxy, who wish to disappear among the numerous uncatalogued settlements in the middle of the vast continent."
	spaceport "The spaceport makes up a small section of the largest city, which happens to be located on the shores of Austral's all-encompassing ocean. From the spaceport, ships land and discharge whatever they are carrying to a warehouse, where the cargo is sorted to various depots and sent by land, sea, or air to its destination."

	description "Misoes is a very religious world here in the Periphery. Established by Christian missionaries in the 25th century, the quiet colony grew to house a significant population who took sanctuary here."
	description "	A popular folk tale found here commonly centers on a pirate crew who came to pillage a local village. When they landed and began to terrorize the inhabitants, they were astonished by the Misoans' kindness even in the face of hostility, and many of them elected to defect from their captain and live out peaceful lives in the village."
	spaceport "While quite small for a planetary spaceport serving a planet this populated, the spaceport has the ability to serve large ships. The spaceport is of an older design, where ships park in rows adjoining a terminal building that connects to the spaceport's main complex."
	spaceport "	The spaceport serves the oldest city on Misoes, which also happens to be the location of the first church here. It is a popular destination for offworlders and pilgrims, who come to admire the architecture and the natural valleys of the moon. One of the most well-known sights in this part of the galaxy is the gas giant Providence setting under Misoes' horizon, creating a spectacular vista."

San Paolo is also home to Taurus-Ikaros Defense Group, one of the largest weapon manufacturers in the South."
	description "	As the first planet to be settled in this region, its customs and culture differ somewhat from the other planets in the Periphery. Many people from all corners of space come to San Paolo's pristine beaches during the summer. Although prosperous, San Paolo is not without its issues. It is well known for being the center of the criminal underground in the Southern Rim, with significant connections to pirate planets like Greenrock."
	spaceport "The spaceport, a collection of dozens of ring-shaped platforms, is located by a lake in sight of the capital city, constructed recently to accommodate the large influx of tourists and immigrants.

	description "Inova was once a thriving colony. However, during a gruesome fight between the planetary miltia and a band of pirates in orbit, debris from the battle rained over the planet and destroyed its major settlements. Aid efforts were particularly hampered by intense dust storms across the planet, which was made worse by the battle debris, and so relief efforts focused more on evacuation than mitigation. Today, few human settlements remaining on Inova, and those that do live in abject conditions independent of any outside government."
	description "	Occassionally, researchers have been known to travel to Inova and camp out on the planet for weeks at a time, performing studies on exotic meteorology and dust storms that would not be possible elsewhere. Although the landing beacon for the spaceport is still active, what's left of it has sunk into the sea, leaving a large crater in its wake."

	description "Mars was humanity's first attempt at terraforming. When the first experiments yielded mixed results, the project was abandoned as far more hospitable planets were available to those with enough money to pay for interstellar travel."
	description "	The major decline in interstellar trade during the 25th century forced Earth to find a new breadbasket for its unparalleled population, prompting the development of greenhouses away from crowded Earth. Escaping famine, Mars received millions of settlers from Earth to set up a new life as farmers in the greenhouses. Successive terraforming efforts has made Mars more habitable and suitable for farming."
	description "	Mars was also the headquarters of the Republic Navy, until Geminus took that position when the Paradise Worlds joined the Republic."
	spaceport "The planetary spaceport on Mars is situated in the southern hemisphere, next to a vast inland sea. The port itself is very utilitarian, with vast entrances that connect underground while the surface reserved for the cargo vessels. Large electric carts speed along everywhere in the port, taking and loading containers in and out of starships."
	spaceport "	In the main structure of the spaceport large historical recounts adorn the walls, describing events stretching back to the initial colonization of this planet in 2080. The bar appears even more ancient than that; clearly the loss in traffic from the relocation of the Navy Headquarters has had its toll."

	description "Venus was a planet where surface temperatures were hot enough to melt lead. But with the dawn of the space age, many organizations focused on making the planet habitable for humans due to its Earth-like characteristics. After half a millennia of work the planet is now mostly habitable, but the atmosphere is still unbreathable without assistance."
	description "	Since the Republic's formation, Venus has been home to Republic Intelligence and the Interstellar Court of Justice, giving it a high position in Republic politics despite its low population."
	description `	Another distinctive feature of Venus are its especially tailored biospheres, providing a similar function to Pearl but with a particular focus on the preservation of Earth's dwindling wildlife. The success of these biospheres has led to Venus being popularly known as the "Garden of the Republic".`
	spaceport "Unlike Earth's spaceport, Venus' busy spaceport is surprisingly clean, and far more evoking. Consisting of a ring of skyscrapers covered in greenery, pilots have complained more about the impracticality of the vegetation covering the docking areas far more than they have commented on the beauty of the gardens that bring a sense of life to the port; to the tourists, it's all part of the awe-inspiring view that Venus uniquely provides."
	spaceport "	From the spaceport, there's a series of elevators that connect to multiple maglev stations, which themselves connect to the ever growing network of urban settlements. In the distance you spot another spaceport, most likely for Navy or private Republic vessels."

	description "New Sichuan was one of the first Earth-like worlds to be settled. A steep mountain world, colonists initially introduced livestock, but came to favor farming rice in terraces sculpted from the mountains. As the centuries passed the cities grew to become some of the largest and the farms became more automated, creating a system of farming complexes and distribution centers that provides for itself and nearby planets."
	description "	During the Alpha Wars, New Sichuan was briefly occupied by Alphas. In their retreat, they systematically destroyed farming complexes and distribution centers, causing widespread famine across the planet. When the Alpha Wars ended, the population was largely restored during the Caravan Era and measures were taken to ensure tragedy never struck again. Each city holds large towers housing aquaponic farms to supplement the rice fields. These towers are symbols of the human ability to adapt, and receive many off-world visitors."
	spaceport "New Sichuan Starport is a massive complex carved into face of a mountain, extending deep underground, with enough hangars embedded in the cliff for thousands of ships. The main building is on the side facing one of the few valleys in this mountain range where the capital resides."

As industrialization took hold, those villages gradually became floating cities large enough to rival metropolises on Earth, and thanks to the discovery of massive silicon deposits, the burgeoning electronics industry that emerged is now the largest export of New Guangdong."
	description "	Along with Vinci, much of the electronics utilized in human space originate from components fabricated here. The competition between the two planets can be quite fierce at times; while New Guangdong tends to have a higher output of electronics, Vinci tends to be further on the bleeding edge."
	spaceport "The spaceport can be described in one word: massive. The main platform is at least seven kilometers in diameter, and surrounding it are smaller platforms capable of taking multiple bulk freighters at the same time, and even then there are too few platforms for all the bulk freighters to land on. Cargo is unloaded from the spaceships and moved by automatic loaders to titanic ships that transport it to factories all across the ocean."
	spaceport "	The central complex of the spaceport could be considered a city by itself. Hundreds of thousands of people move through the building every hour; from large shopping centers, casinos, and hotels, one could visit all of those and still have the rest of the planet to see."

Named for Gregory Mikhail, a politician on old Earth, he financed the expedition to Magna Comae and intended to fly alongside the first colonists to the planet. While Mikhail wouldn't survive the journey, when the colony ship arrived in Magna Comae they gave the planet his name to honor his deeds."
	description "	Over the years Mikhailnov became an industrial world, large enough to create its own shipyards to facilitate the exploitation of the system's other resources. The burgeoning shipbuilding industries have evolved over time to become Yatsunov Shipyards, which holds the title of being the the first shipyard outside the Sol system, and the oldest continously operating shipyard."
	spaceport "Like the spaceport on Chiron, Mikhailnov has two spaceports; a defunct landing site created by the first settlers with their nuclear-powered starships, and the relatively newer spaceport that developed after repulsors became commonplace. And yet the spaceport is still very old among spaceports."
	spaceport "	From the air, you can see how spaceport city grew around the new spaceport, carefully planned to ensure top-of-the-line efficiency for the 27th century galaxy it was built for. This port, unlike most other major spaceports, was made constructed underground. It consists of rows of rings where ships park in deep vertical tunnels, from which lifts move cargo to the surface."

As years passed, the small settlement became a major colony with tens of millions of residents making their livelihoods here. Recently it became a tourist spot, and the many temples here constructed receive thousands of visitors every year. Despite this leap in connections with the rest of the galaxy, there are still many more communities who are truly secluded from the rest of the world."
	spaceport "The spaceport is quite far from the capital; you can see a few buildings on the horizon, but not much more. The port itself is a circular building, with smaller circles acting as platforms to the starships. From the air it's obvious that the building was deliberately designed to resemble a symbol, but you can't recognize it."
	spaceport "	At the center of the circle there's a terminal where people gather before they head off to their next destination. The ground level is a transport hub, where ground vehicles come to take or drop off people before going to the city. Close by, there's a large terraced garden with local flora, placed in a position where people can watch the ships take off."

The settlers are still struggling to establish themselves; although it is an hospitable climate, the amount of labor needed to clear forests and to plow rocky fields has meant that the towns here can only grow very slowly."
	description "	The farms grow both food crops and cotton, and very recently they have begun manufacturing their own textiles instead of just shipping the raw cotton off-world for processing."
	spaceport "Asrayapur's spaceport is a ring of low wooden buildings around a wide landing area paved with concrete slabs. Around the perimeter carts of trade goods are driven, some being pulled by tractors and others, by horses or oxen. You even think you see a few carts being pulled by water buffalo."
