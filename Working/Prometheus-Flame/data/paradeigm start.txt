After graduating and working on a shipwright for ten years, you finally have enough to afford the License and even keep some savings. `

	`The bank's interior is a strange mix of urban office design composed of wooden walls and floor with patches of plants and grass that break the brown walls every so often; despite this the building is imposing, with story after story of columns and spires and balconies, some looking to be very tall. A doorman stands by a heavy set of glass doors each leading to an office. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The loan broker's office is equally imposing, with large display monitors filling the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only seen in movies: Aldebaran. Tarazed. Earth.`
	`	The pen is heavy as lead but glides almost without friction as you print your initials on the bottom of page after page of ominous legal documents and sign several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a balding middle-aged man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, flips the pages past you quickly, uttering a curt, "Sign here.

	`	The elevator is so well-tuned that you do not even realize it is moving until it has deposited you back in the lobby. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and rocket fuel; wonderful smells. There are many ship models to choose from, but only some are within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your path...`
