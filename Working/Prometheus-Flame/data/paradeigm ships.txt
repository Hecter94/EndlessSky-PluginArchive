	description "When the Borderworlds and South began to establish trade routes of their own, the need for a cheap ferry ship was done using the Betelgeuse Shuttle, for centuries that was the norm until the early days of the Republic when constant pirate attacks coupled with the Shuttle own shortcomings left a toll far to large for Paradeigm, so a replacement was desired by novice Border captains and Company Logistics. Seeing this as an opportunity Paradeigm developed their own shuttle derivative, the Zokef."
	description "Although its bulky and more expensive compared to its closest competitor, the F2 'Zokef' compensates with a larger cargo and passenger capacity while having enough space to equip better engines and systems for endurance, its modularity and large outfit space (for its size), allows it to undertake multiple roles like a basic combat ship using its two gun-ports wisely or operating like a miner starcraft, however because this is a Shuttle derived vehicle first and foremost it can't compare to a specialized vessel so captains should take note of that."
