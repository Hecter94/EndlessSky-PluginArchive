		description "New Guangdong is an ocean world almost devoid of landmasses. The first settlers that came here established small outposts and fishing villages on the few islands rose above the surface. As industrialization took hold, those villages gradually became floating cities large enough to rival metropolises on Earth, and thanks to the discovery of massive silicon deposits, the burgeoning electronics industry that emerged is now the largest export of New Guangdong."
		description "Ever since the attack to the Starport is slowly sinking, thousands of starcraft came to help the evacuation and ships escaping to not be swallowed by the former starport. The nuclear blast also created a massive tsunami that struck cities on the other side of the planet so an evacuation order was sent by the central government to neighboring New Sichuan."
		spaceport "Whats left of the starport is a mess, with the crater left by the blast sinking the whole structure, you can still see some navy ships entering the structure to try and save the people trapped here. more merchant vessels land in the smaller pads still functioning to take the survivors off-world."

			`As you pass through the spaceport something catches your attention, a group near another video screen in the local bar.`
			`	The scene is of a large government hall, where an important looking man is standing before a crowd, It seems to be announcing something, "... and for those reasons we decided that regardless of the doubts caste by the attacks to the White Belt. We will continue to advocate for the reformation of the election of planetary representatives and reevaluation of all existing trade tariffs in the Republic, until then we will continue to support the Free Worlds on their cause. `

		description "As the Planet recovered from the attacks, the people are returning back to the cities, meanwhile a new port is now being planned. While New Guangdong will not recover what had lost in the attacks there's an optimistic feeling as new people come and help build the cities."
		spaceport "The planned port for New Guangdong is expected to surpass its predecessor, an estimated ten kilometers in diameter its planned to become the largest structure in all of human space, until then, the temporary port will continue to operate as the center for interstellar trade."
