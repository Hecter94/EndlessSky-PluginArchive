		"Medium Graviton Steering"

	description "The Skylark is used by the Quarg as a freighter and warship. Although inferior to any true Quarg warship, the Skylark is more than capable of defending its cargo from attack, and often defends against attacks by less advanced civilizations."

ship "Quarg Wardragon"

	description "The standard Quarg thruster trades power and space efficiency for a reversible thrusting system. This innovation allows Quarg ships an unprecedented level of maneuverability, if not speed. While most would consider the massive power usage crippling, the Quarg’s reactors are powerful enough to render energy a non-issue."

outfit "Medium Graviton Steering"
	description "The Quarg's Medium Graviton Steering is strangely ineffective for such a technologically advanced engine. The Quarg's focus on reversible thrusters and beam turrets has led to a peculiar situation. The turning speed of most vessels is considered mostly irrelevant."

#Guns+Turrets

outfit "Quarg Skylance"
	thumbnail "outfit/skylance"
	description "The Skylance has been the Quarg’s standard weapon for millennia, and for good reason. Powerful enough to punch through shield and hull alike, accurate enough to eliminate fighters, and small enough to fit on freighters; it’s easy to see why most Quarg captains never use any other weapon. Its only drawback is the sheer amount of energy needed to fire, which is rendered a non-issue by Quarg reactor technology."

outfit "Quarg Anti-Missile"
	thumbnail "outfit/quargantimissile"
	description "The standard Quarg anti-missile system is so ubiquitous it lacks a name. Literally called `The Anti-Missile`, `The Anti-Missile System`, or `The Anti-Missile Turret`, the Quarg have never seen a need for another missile defense system. Some have hypothesized that the focus on damage over fire rate may give some insight into the Quarg missile technology of the distant past."

#Systems+Power

outfit "Quantum Shield Generator"
	thumbnail "outfit/quantumshield"
	description "This space-efficient Quarg shield generator is both powerful and energy-efficient. While the Quantum effects exploited by the generator require a large minimum size for maximum efficiency, any ship capable of fitting this device will shrug off all but the heaviest of fire."

outfit "Nanotech Battery"
	thumbnail "outfit/nanotechbattery"
	"fuel capacity" 200
	description "These batteries use exotic miniaturization techniques to fit massive quantities of fuel and energy. The capacity of these wonders of miniaturization is such that many non-Quarg vessels could conceivably use a single one of these batteries in place of a reactor. The fact that most Quarg vessels install one of these devices in addition to an Antimatter Core is testament to the extreme energy costs of Quarg technology."

outfit "Antimatter Core"
	thumbnail "outfit/unknown"
	"ramscoop" 10
	description "The Quarg Antimatter Core is the core of their technological doctrine. This highly heat and size efficient reactor fuels the energy-guzzling, but mass and thermal efficient, Quarg systems. Able to run for centuries without refueling, their only downside is the extreme cost and complexity of construction."
