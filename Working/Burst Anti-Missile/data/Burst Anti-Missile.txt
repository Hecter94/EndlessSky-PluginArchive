	description "This unusual turret was designed as a counter to burst fired missile barrages. The Hai designed this system as protection for their merchant vessels, which are occasionally targeted by brief, but intense, bursts of tracker fire. It combines improved power and fire-rate with a large Energy Core magazine."

	description "This unusual turret was designed as a counter to burst fired missile barrages. The standard Wanderer Anti-Missile can destroy almost any missile in a single shot, but is limited by its fire-rate. This version solves that problem at the cost of endurance. While the Energy Core system improves the fire-rate by a factor of ten, it risks complete depletion of anti-missile capacity."

	description "This unusual turret was designed as a counter to burst fired missile barrages. Most anti-missile systems are limited by the amount of energy they can pump through their systems. This weapon, produced by Deep research facilities, avoids thats problem by way of disposable energy cores. These non-rechargeable cores have massive energy densities and can replace that energy with heat as it is depleted. Combined with rapid cycling systems, they allow a greatly improved fire rate."
