	description "Cobbled together from old pieces of disused Carriers and Cruisers, the Poseidon is more than the sum of its parts would imply; designed to be capable of enormous maximum speeds, it is capable of ripping through an enemy force while being sturdy enough to withstand a more protracted battle; when reinforcing the hull segments, it seems that the designers overcompensated, leaving the Poseidon with one of the toughest hulls in Human space."
	description "When the shipyards on Geminus are finally rebuilt, it is likely that the Navy will begin manufacturing Poseidons from new parts, vastly increasing their durability."
