	description "The Syndicate CT-75 Star Barge is little more than a cluster of cargo containers with an engine at one end and a cockpit on the other. It is a slow and ugly ship, but it can carry enough cargo to earn its captain a steady income even in parts of the galaxy where it is hard to find passengers to carry or courier missions."
	description "	Because they often carry valuable cargo, and because they are too slow to evade any attackers, Star Barges are a common target of pirates."
	description "	This is an enlarged version with additional cargo containers."

	description "The Hauler Z is the smallest thinkable Hauler. Introduced only two years after the Hauler freighter, the ship's name derives from the fact that this warship has zero cargo space. In the decades following its release, the Hauler Z saw widespread service in the first Republic military. This ship has recently returned to prominence in the South, fueled in part by the militia's need for a dedicated light warship to suppress the growing pirate presence in the sector."
	description "	Because of its great combat ability, the Hauler Z is extremely cost effective, delivering an inordinate amount of firepower for an affordable price. Some small convoys utilize the Hauler Z as a cheap and robust defensive platform to fend off attacks. Larger convoys often rely on the newer Bastion series."

#	description "The Hauler Z is the smallest thinkable Hauler ship. It was introduced just two years after the Hauler freighter. Its name was derived from the fact that this light warship has zero cargo space."
#	description "	In the following decades, the Hauler Z formed the backbone of the first military forces of the new Republic. They were also used to enforce the trade embargos in the 2740's."
#	description "	Recently, demand for the Hauler Z has increased in the South. The ship's return to prominence was fueled in part by the militia's need for a dedicated light warship to suppress the growing pirate presence in the sector. This ship delivers good firepower at an affordable price, which makes it a great choice for captains who need cheap yet robust ships to fend off attacks."

#	description "This entry level warship uses standard Hauler components."
#	description "	Recently, the old Hauler Z series gained popularity again. As the pirate fleets in the South got stronger every year and the Southern Defense Pact was formed which lead once again to a sudden demand for lightweight warships. This ship still delivers high firepower for a low price."
