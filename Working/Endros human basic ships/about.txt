This plugin adds:
- Hauler Zero Light Warship to the Southbound Shipyards. Simply a Hauler with zero cargo pods.
- A ct-75 (large) Star Barge.
It does not modify the fleet definitions though, because they are generally subject to change with every new ship and thus any fleet definition in this plugin might become outdated pretty soon.
