			`As you are flying to the landing pad, you see the fruits of the Kor Efret collaboration: where once there were deserts, now there are grasslands or even small forests, mostly composed of short trees like you've never seen before. All over the planet there are small settlements in the middle of these woods, probably because they were the key component in the growing of those shrubs. You land in the spaceport of the largest establishment, a city with some buildings almost a hundred meters high and large landing pads placed in the middle of a major forest, which predates the Wanderer settlement by at least a century. There are many automated robots circling the pads and taking care of the nearest plants. The Wanderers haven't been here for long, but in a couple decades this landscape hardly will be distinguishable from some photographs of the Human paradise worlds, excluding the exclusive resorts and expensive hotels.`
			`	What you see in the spaceport, however, is totally different from the kinder appearance of the planet. Most of the Wanderers here have ruffled feathers, a shabby appearance, and some are even whimpering; you can't tell if they are sad, or scared, or both. You try to ask somebody what is going on, but all you can gather is some whispered words in the Wanderer language. After some searching, you finally find a nervous Tema'a Iriket.`

You continue flying and then land near a large treetop village, next to three 'Strong Wind'. You assume were used to transport the other elders who already moved to the new worlds. Iriket, hesitantly, disembarks with you. She adjusted her feathers during the trip and her tail has almost stopped quivering, but you can tell she is as nervous as when you met her.

You arrive in a large room, with a very high roof and where you see at least two dozens Wanderers, presumably the elders, having a discussion in the Wanderer language. As you look better at them, you notice that many seem to have the first evidence of the Molt, some are on wheelchairs akin to the one used by Rek months ago and a few seem to have already survived the Molt. None of them seem to notice your presence, nor to shift into Hai language to allow you to understand.`

"I believe he is still in quarantine," she answers, "but he should finish molting in a few days. Maybe even tomorrow." Your attention is caught by a Wanderer child, probably an elder that molted, who climbed on a table, swelled his chest and started buffeting his wings towards another Wanderer. "It is an [old, ancilliar] form of intimidation." Irket explains to you. Her crest droops while she talks: maybe that means she is ashamed, or perhaps angry; you can't say for sure. "It's what our ancestors used to do to display dominance or to reclaim territory. It's considered by many as gross and aggressive, and definitely not something adequate for this situation."`

We were [outraged? confused?] by that suggestion, and we tried to understand why they were suggesting something so [useless? atrocious? terrible?]." Your translator is having some difficulties figuring out what Iriket means, probably because it can't work out the tone she is trying to give to the conversation.

			`	While Iriket is talking, you see Tele'ek walking towards you. She hails him. "Greetings, Aker'at Tele'ek." As with Rek, his role name changed, from Sobari to Aker'at. "Greetings. Can I talk with <last>? I have some news," he says, followed by some words in Wanderer language. She walks away in the direction of the spaceport, rapidly disappearing in the crowd. "The last time we met was months ago, and I was still [trapped? immersed?] in my old [body, form]. I imagine you might have some [interrogatives, questions] to ask me, so feel free to do it now.`

			`	While Iriket is talking, you see the Molted who, at the meeting, buffeted his wings to intimidate another elder. He is walking towards you. She hails him. "Greetings, Aker'at Tele'ek." It takes you a second to understand that he is Tele'ek, and that his role name changed as it did with Rek. "Greetings. Can I talk with <last>? I have some news," he says, followed by some words in Wanderer language. She walks away in the direction of the spaceport, rapidly disappearing in the crowd.

			`	"I imagine Iriket explained you the [meaning, value] of the gesture." You nod, and explain that she also said it is something only the Wanderer ancestors used to do. "It's true," he says, "usually the Wanderer have now a good control over their [sentiments, impulses]. But after recieving the Molt i feel more [combative? bellicose?]. I have less control over my primal instinct, I feel the desire not only to resist, but to [win? do justice?]." You realize it's probably the first time you hear a Wanderer talking about 'winning'. You aren't sure if that's a good or a bad thing.`

			`	"Follow me, Captain." You enter in a large metal building, where you see at least a hundred Wanderers are flying from a room to another. Tele'ek seems start to opening his wings to fly as well, but then remembers you don't have wings and decides to walk next to you. You arrive in a hangar, where a dozen scientists are busy working on some kind of laser beam mounted on a Tempest.`

			`	"Since we met the [warlike, belligerent] robotic factions in Korath space," he says, "we have been working on a new weapon, to [succeed, prevail] where the Sunbeam fails. A [strong? capable?] weapon, created to damage the hull of a ship and disable it effectively." During all his speech, Aker'at Tele'ek has been staring at the white and azure weapon that the Wanderers in the room are moving to the Tempest. He doesn't seem disgusted or displeased, more like excited or, even, proud. Just for a moment, an unexplainable thrill passes through your spine.`
