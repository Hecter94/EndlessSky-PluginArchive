	description "This is the most advanced weapon to ever be created by humans.  It harnesses exotic particles to create a burst of energy much more intense than the one generated by the standard particle cannon.  The tradeoff is that it requires much more energy, generates much more heat, and takes up more space.  Built in capacitors help mitigate the energy draw and allow the weapon to fire faster, but these must be allowed to recharge between short bursts."
