	description "This is a prototype fast warship equipped with the best humanity have to offer with speed of Tarazed Falcon and durability of a Navy Cruiser. Other features includes built-in advanced sensor arrays, better ramscoop."
	description "*Disclaimer, due to its in-development nature certain function may work at reduced efficiency, however we've made sure it will still provide a performance unmatched by any other ships(Disclaimer: for this case, only human ships as in ships manufactured within human settlements according to Republic official Galaxy Map, such as ships manufactured by Republic, Syndicates, Megaparsec, Betelgeuse, Southbound, and Tarazed shipyards.)."
