# Deprecated Korath ships in Continuous, placed here to maintain fleet/npc compatibility.
# While my primary goal is to maintain compatibility with the most recent stable release (v0.9.14 as of this writing), I didn't want to leave fans on continuous out.

	description "After the Korath were exiled from their homelands, efficient resource collection became a priority. World-ships were too precious to risk on dangerous forays, and Raiders lacked the cargo capacity. The Dredger was born as an answer to this problem, featuring an abundance of cargo and passenger space, with formidable defensive armament. With such a complement, these bulky ships can also offer potent support for frontline Raiders."
