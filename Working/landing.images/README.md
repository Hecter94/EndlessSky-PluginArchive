Replaces all planet landing images with better fitting ones.<br>
<br>
These images replace the boring vanilla images you see when you've landed on a planet with new, AI generated, better fitting ones. The old ones look like photos from earth or taken from public NASA archives(which they are). According to the description of the planets I tried to generate better fitting, more futuristic, more alien-looking images. And I think that went well :) <br>
0.10.8 with 472 planets<br>
