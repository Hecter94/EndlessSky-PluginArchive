 	description "Advanced gunship made for sole purpose of being one of the best solo combat ship packed with as much weapon as it can fit, some even rumoured to be of alien origin. Designed by a wealthy bounty hunter as his personal ship before the blueprint got leaked, this highly capable gunship is now available to anyone with money and know where to find them. It is said that in skilled hand this ship can punch far above its own weight."
