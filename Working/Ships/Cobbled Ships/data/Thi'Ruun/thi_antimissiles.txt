	description "The Thi'Ruun have never progressed far beyond missiles; what little energy weapon tech they have is crude and underdeveloped. Even their anti-missile technologies require counter-missiles to keep up, and even the lowly pencil rockets are fine-tuned to intelligently destroy swarms of missiles."
	description "Being little more than a handful of rocket cradles and a reloading system, the Sentence-class Countermissile System is used only on tiny defense drones and fighters."
	description "Using ammunition does mean that the Countermissile Systems employed by the Thi'Ruun can be a liability in longer battles, but Pencil Rockets are tiny, and many dozens of them can be stored even within this tiny countermissile battery."

	description "This larger Thi'Ruun countermissile battery includes a magnetic accelerator, greatly increasing the range and fire rate as well as slightly increasing the effective interference delivered. This countermissile battery also holds a significantly larger quantity of ammunition, allowing for greater usage in the field."

	description "The largest Thi'Ruun anti missile battery that uses pencil rockets, and a considerable threat to even the largest of missile batteries. The improvements to range and shot power are minimal, but the fire rate has been massively increased, to the point that even specialized missile boats may have trouble overwhelming one or two of them."

	description "This massive countermissile system is intended to certainly destroy high-powered missiles that would otherwise deliver significant damage to a Thi'Ruun ship. This turret fires its countertorpedoes slowly, but when nothing else will stop a projectile, this system can get the job done."
	description "Unlike pencil rockets, which only have a cursory disabling charge, Eraser Torpedoes have massive shaped-charge warheads that can even punch through the Thi'Ruun's missile shield technology. They're overkill against all but the largest missiles; however, they're quite sluggish to arm."
