	description "Though hard to acquire and expensive to modify, this Corvette is quite the favorite among many pirates. Going beyond the unmodified version of the already powerful Corvette, the shield matrix has been boosted with more emitters. And, its hull has been reinforced some, perhaps to help against nervousness flying a ship that'd get punched through like a piece of paper if it were hit by an asteroid while shields were down. Room has been made for an additional turret mount, as well."

	description "Though hard to acquire and expensive to modify, this Corvette is quite the favorite among many pirates. Going beyond the unmodified version of the already powerful Corvette, the shield matrix has been boosted with more emitters, and its hull is moderately reinforced. Opportunities have been taken to add two more gun ports to the sides, and two whole new turret mounts along the middle of the ship."

	description "Though hard to acquire and expensive to modify, this Corvette is quite the favorite among many pirates. Going beyond the unmodified version of the already powerful Corvette, the shield matrix has been boosted with more emitters, and its hull is moderately reinforced. Its engine mounts have been significantly expanded, allowing room for very powerful atomic thrusters, and giving it immense forward speed nearly rivaling competitive racing ships."
