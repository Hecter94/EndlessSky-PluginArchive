	description "The Consignare is the largest of the Reifan fleet. Since the Reifans were a peaceful race, and had no rivals, they had no real warships for combat. The occasional rogue ship meant the Reifans needed weapons on all of their ships, but only the Consignare, the largest of the Reifan fleet, had any real firepower. Thus, the Consignare has been made the flagship for almost all of the Reifan detachments."
