# The 'variant' attribute numbers add up to a total, and the probability of a variant spawning is the variant's number out of the total number
# These are edited versions of the Large Regional Merchants fleets, using Boarding Defense variants for freighters and given a heavier escort to provide more challenge than a typical merchant fleet.
