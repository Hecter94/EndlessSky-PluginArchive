	description "The fuel tanker is basically a flying gas station. The stock Jump Tanker holds enough fuel for 8 normal jumps, and has more ramscoop than any human device. It is used by long-distance fleets of all types throughout the galaxy, saving outfitting and cargo space for more useful items such as defensive items or trade goods, and is very cost effective in the long run."
	description "	The one shortcoming of the Jump Tanker is its very poor defence. The tanker, no matter how useful, is still that, a tanker. In order to fly smoothly, armor was sacrificed in favor of speed and shields, and thus is much more dangerous when it explodes, and much weaker in general. It is advised to have a good amount of defence on other ships to protect the tanker, or for it to be held back until either the need arises or just a system behind. If all else fails, it is highly advised that you promptly, get your hull the hell out of there."

	description "The recent asteroid mining boom prompted companies to expand their horizons, and start sending out larger fleets of vessels outfitted for mining. Unfortunately, paying to retrofit cargo ships, as well as crew them is expensive, as there are very few ships that are able to effectively mine."
	description "	These issues prompted shipyards to start accommodating for miners, but it wasn't enough. So, after petitioning the Republic to allow civilian drone use, the large corporations finally got the powers-that-be to give them rights to use drones, as long as they weren't equipped with any military armament."
