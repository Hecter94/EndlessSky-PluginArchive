	description `This is the Trillinox, flagship of the Lumeshi Initiative. A crescent-shaped superstructure of advanced white titanium composite, the Trillinox spans over three kilometers from bow to stern. Its outer hull features a layered adaptive plating system designed to shift molecular alignment in response to specific radiation spectrums. Along the dorsal arc, retractable sensor vanes and long-range subspace arrays are embedded flush with the surface, minimizing drag in atmospheric operations. Engine housings are recessed into the aft section, with four primary gravitic drives arranged in a diamond configuration for precision maneuvering.`
	spaceport `The landing bay is a pressure-sealed cavity carved into the ship's ventral section, ringed with magnetic stabilizers and docking clamps recessed directly into the deck plating. The interior is lined with reflective radiation baffles and segmented forcefield gates, allowing for atmospheric containment without full structural closure. Structural support columns double as integrated cargo lifts, with conduit channels concealed behind seamless paneling.`

			`The moment your ship exits jump into this system, a ping interrupts your navchart update. You're being hailed, by something... big. Outside your viewport, a stark white shape glides into view. It's massive, graceful, and gleaming with polished plating, though some parts of the ship look unfinished. No registry. No callsign. The signal is not local, not human.`
			`You accept the hail.`
			`"Greetings, independent traveler." a soft, high-pitched voice chimes in across the comms. "This is the Trillinox, flagship of the Lumeshi Initiative. We are currently redesigning our vessel for radiation adaptation. Your presence is of interest. Please dock for peaceful negotiation."`
			`You hesitate. Then again, who says no to a ship that size when it says "please"?`

			`They're about half your height, covered in soft fur of deep auburn, each wearing loose orange silk, like tunics. One steps forward, tail gently swishing.`
			`"Welcome, human captain! We are the Lumeshi, starfarers, thinkers, and adapters. Our ship is undergoing structural revision to prepare for passage into a radiation cluster. This system's asteroids are now depleted. But your vessel contains... interesting designs and materials."`
			`It waves a paw, and a projection of your ship's systems appears in high details, with several components highlighted, drive coils, power modulators, shield geometry.`
