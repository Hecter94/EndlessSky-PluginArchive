	description "This long-range flak cannon pairs well with vulnerable, high-damage missile weapons by showering the target with ballistic flak. A single projectile is launched, and at a pre-programmed distance it explodes into several small fragments which will trigger anti-missile systems. A well-timed salvo can ensure the survival of the desired payload."
	description "Naturally, if the targeted were to collide with the projectile prior to denonation, it would take considerable damage. After separation, however, the flak is relatively harmless."
