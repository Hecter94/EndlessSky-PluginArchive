# Caltrops-type secondary weapon. Variations deal different damage types.
# Ship launches a mine, mine has large trigger radius. When triggered, launches submunitions randomly towards
# the triggering target. Submunition launch pattern should approximate a circle around the target's current position
# Submunitions simultaneously expire into a 1-frame life explosive object with a blast radius such that, if
# launched in a circle, each blast radius would touch the center of the circle.
# Note: These outfits deal splash damage! you'll get hit too

	description "The Warp Snare Setter configures its traps to deal considerable slowing damage, which may aid in making quick getaways from larger or otherwise superior fleets - as long as the pilot avoids being caught in the blast as well."

	description "The Snare is a unique development in space warfare. Each guards a large section of space, and any hostile ships which approach are targeted with a barrage of small explosive charges. While not able to deal much damage, the microexplosives are typically designed to cripple some element of the targeted ship, along with other ships near it."
