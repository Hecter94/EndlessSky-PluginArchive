- This is version 0.4 of Red's Star Trek Prime Ship Pack Plugin.
 - This is the main ship pack to go alongside my other plugins.
  - Red's The Final Frontier is required to run this plugin as this is just a ship pack that adds more vessels to the final frontier plugin.


- I have changed things and will be adding more to my plugins and the Final Frontier with time so expect updates at random times.
- This pack contains ships from the prime timeline of star trek but in the modern eras.
- I have other Plugins dedicated to different species from Star Trek Lore
- I plan to work on other Plugins as time goes on, here is a list of some Plugins i aim to finish:

  -Cardassian Ship Pack
  -Dominion Ship Pack
  -Kelvin Timeline Ship Pack
  -Klingon Ship Pack
