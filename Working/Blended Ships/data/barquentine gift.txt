			`When you land on Tundra, Tomek seems glad to see Katya back, but you sense that he's also a little wary of how she will respond to the choices the Free Worlds have been making. "Using nukes, threatening orbital bombardment," says Katya, "treating the Syndicate as an ally. Anything else I missed while I was gone?"`

			`	Alondo says, "Unfortunately, we do have a plan. Our very last contingency plan. We call it the 'checkmate' option. Our fleet will push north--"`
			`	He is interrupted by one of Tomek's men running into the room. "Sir, we have a major Navy fleet incoming. We need all ships in the air immediately to repulse them. Reinforcements are on their way, but they may not get here for a while."`
			`	Tomek says, "So, it begins. Captain <last>, get back to your ship and aid in the defense."`

			`Tomek and Alondo meet you when you land. Tomek says, "Good work aiding in the defense. Now we need to move before the Navy has time to regroup. And the Senate has decided that you will be in charge of the fleet that makes our counterattack."`
			`	Alondo says, "They have also approved a salary increase for you, to seventeen thousand credits per diem. I know that's probably still not enough, but we are running a bit low on cash."`
			`	"One other thing," says Tomek. "Since you're going to be leading the counterattack, we decided it would be best if you had a more powerful warship. Ever since the Dreadnought was rolled out, Southbound's engineers have been working on a flagship for our fleet, the Barquentine. It was going to be mine, but I think you're going to need it more than me."`
			`	Tomek leads you out to the ship, a gleaming giant of polished titanium and green paint. One entire half of the otherwise ordinary Dreadnought has been removed, and no fewer than sixteen gun barrels stand in its place.`
			`	"Isn't the F.S. Kauri beautiful? She's both faster and more powerful than the Dreadnought, and fitted with all the latest technology. That includes nukes, by the way, although you can always sell them back to the outfitter and fit something else in their place. Make any improvements you feel are necessary to her: she's all yours, now and forever. Just make sure you take good care of her. She's the only Barquentine in our whole fleet at the moment, and if we win this war soon we may never build another."`
			`	Leaving you to admire the F.S. Kauri, Tomek turns to walk away. "Oh, and meet us back in the spaceport as soon as you've got her kitted out and ready to fly. Of course, if you're ready to go immediately that's fine, too."`

			`Freya meets you soon after you land. "I've heard the news," she says. "I talked to the Senate, and they think that I should travel with you during your assault on the Pug, in case I can help figure out their technology, maybe even how to restore the hyperspace links. And they say they need Alondo back here to do diplomatic visits and help keep people from panicking."`
			`	"I guess that makes sense," says Alondo.`
			`	"Also," says Freya, "Southbound has just finished producing another warship for us, based off the Dreadnought. Unfortunately, there's only one, but we thought it would be fitting for you to be the one to fly it. This way, you'll be able to go into battle against the Pug with the strongest ship possible."`
			`	Freya leads you out to the ship, a gleaming giant of polished titanium and green paint. One entire half of the otherwise ordinary Dreadnought has been removed, and no fewer than sixteen gun barrels stand in its place.`

She's the only Barquentine in our whole fleet at the moment, and if we win are able to defeat the Pug we may never build another."`
			`	As Alondo leaves to catch a transport to Bourne, Freya turns to face you. "Oh, and one more thing, <first>. The Senate approved a raise for you. Your new salary will be seventeen thousand credits a day."`
			`	Freya takes you to the spaceport and introduces you to the captains of the two Dreadnoughts that have volunteered to fight the Pug. She also asks you all sorts of technical questions: what sort of propulsion and energy sources the Pug seem to use, what their weapon capabilities are, and whether you saw any sign of the technology that was used to destroy the hyperspace links. You have a hard time answering her, but are glad that she will be with you this time to see the aliens firsthand.`
