			`Unfortunately, the Republic ambassadors turn out to match all your worst stereotypes of Republic diplomats: dressed in gaudy, impractical clothing, and carrying an absurd amount of luggage. At first you are worried about whether you have enough space for them, but one of them explains that they would not dream of traveling in your dirty old ship; they will be traveling in style, in a Star General luxury liner, and your only duty is to ensure their safety. You have little choice but to acquiesce: at least they aren't flying in something as insecure as a traditional Star Queen!`
