	description "Ever since the Tarazed Falcon was released, starship captains across the galaxy have argued over whether it or the Betelgeuse Leviathan is a better ship. After some arguments got out of hand, Greenrock Shipyards, Ltd. produced a new ship from the parts of the Falcon and Leviathan, complete with a big cannon in the front. Most of the time, the cannon is just a normal gun, but with some modifications, it can be used as a spinal mount. This ship has those modifications, along with some other ones."
