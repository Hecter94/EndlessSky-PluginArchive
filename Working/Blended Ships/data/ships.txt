	description "With the recent uptick in Unfettered raids in the north of Hai space, a new model of ship, the Ant, has become increasingly popular. The Ant is a modified Aphid that uses semi-automated systems to allow one person to command a defensible merchant ship, a must for traders in an increasingly violent galaxy."

	description "Originally designed as a flagship for the Free Worlds' war fleet, the Barquentine is a unique model based off the Southbound Shipyards Dreadnought. Armed with no fewer than 16 gun ports, the Barquentine is capable of taking down a Navy Carrier - and its full fighter and drone complement - in the hands of a skilled pilot. However, its mass imbalance and broadside weapon mounting makes it the most difficult ship to pilot in all of human space."

Seeing this, a young upstart company called Tomcat Shipping cut a Shuttle in half and bolted it to a mangled Clipper. The resultant product is the Tomcat Catamaran, the most versatile transport of its class!"

For this, the Syndicate hired Tomcat Shipping to turn the existing Bulk Freighter design into a carrier. The resultant ship is lighter than the original and is capable of carrying no fewer than twelve pleasure craft, plus a little bit of extra cargo on the side."

	description "Ever since the Tarazed Falcon was released, starship captains across the galaxy have argued over whether it or the Betelgeuse Leviathan is a better ship. After some arguments got out of hand, Greenrock Shipyards, Ltd. produced a new ship from the parts of the Falcon and Leviathan, complete with a big cannon in the front. Unfortunately, shoving two hulls together tends to produce extra drag, so the Eagle will forever be remembered as a compromise ship: neither fast, nor particularly strong."

	description "The Model 2 is the very earliest stage of a spacefaring Kor Mereti automaton. These tiny ships, incapable of even controlling their own motion, are ejected into space regularly from Kor Mereti planets, and made to fend for themselves. Few survive, but those that do grow in the depths of space, eventually gaining the ability to travel through hyperspace."

	description "While Mereti automata usually progress perfectly fine in their evolution, there are occasionally errors that can compound insanely quickly and produce some very war drones, nothing like the normal progression. These ships tend to be inefficient and weak for their size, but also mostly hollow, allowing them to be unusually light."

	description "The Greenrock Shipyards Rawalpindi is the most heavily armed freighter money can buy. Rumour is that it's even used by some pirates as a raiding ship. It is named after the HMS Rawalpindi, a legendary armed merchant cruiser that was destroyed on Earth more than a thousand years ago. Although naming something after a destroyed ship does not seem like the best business model, you are assured that, since many people struggle to pronounce the name, let alone know of its namesake, there is very little impact on its sales."

	description "After the recent success of the Sunder mining carrier, Syndicated Shipyards has decided to expand the Sunder family to include a freighter that can be built on the same assembly line. The resulting ship, dubbed the Trident, is stronger and more capacious than the Sunder, though it does not carry drones. Slightly less well-armed than other ships of a similar class, it is nonetheless quickly becoming popular among merchants due to its blazing speed - a trait usually lacking in freighters."

	description "Recently, the Republic has had increasingly difficult troubles with pirates on the fringes of human space. Rather than increase funding to the Navy, policy-makers instead decided to fund a new class of ship, assembled out of Star Queen and Rainmaker parts. The Star General is the result: it is slightly less agile than the Star Queen and has slightly less capacity, but is more heavily armoured and able to easily fend off small numbers of pirates with its impressive array of missile launchers. The Republic uses the Star General as a secure luxury transport, and it is also made available to a handful of individuals that have earned the Republic's trust."

A model dating back to soon after the Raven was first released to the market, this ship combines the Firebird's ruggedness with the Raven's unusual efficiency."

	description "The Woodchip, designed by engineers working on Canyon, is an absolutely horrible ship. Although it is reasonably powerful, it is exorbitantly expensive, painfully slow-moving, and has been considered a crime against humanity because each Woodchip contains a jump drive which could have been used in the war against the Pug. The only redeeming feature of this ship - and its main selling point - is the jump drive at its core, taken along with the rest of the raiding ship that went into making it. After some deliberation, the PR manager of the firm that manufactured these ships demanded that the extra engine lobes get removed, and he got his way before being summarily dismissed the day before the company went bankrupt from legal fees."

	description `When the Navy retires old fighters, they occasionally are sold on the civilian market as pleasure craft. These modified Lances, known as "Partisans," are not able to carry passengers like other pleasure craft, nor can they mount guns like a traditional Lance. Paired with the removal of some of their armour plating and the addition of the latest atomic engines, this makes them exceptionally manueverable - albeit not very survivable in combat.`
