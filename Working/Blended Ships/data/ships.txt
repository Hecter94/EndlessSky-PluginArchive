	description "Ever since the Tarazed Falcon was released, starship captains across the galaxy have argued over whether it or the Betelgeuse Leviathan is a better ship. After some arguments got out of hand, Greenrock Shipyards, Ltd. produced a new ship from the parts of the Falcon and Leviathan, complete with a big cannon in the front. Unfortunately, shoving two hulls together tends to produce extra drag, so the Eagle will forever be remembered a comprimise ship: neither fast, nor particularly strong."

	description "The Grackle is a popular ship for those wishing to board and capture pirate vessels. It can defend itself well, while still having space for a lot of passengers or crew, and it also is a formidible light warship in its own right. It is produced by the Sirius Carcenogenics Corporation, a company that exists for the sole purpose of providing demented starships to customers."

	description "The Greenrock Shipyards Rawalpindi is the most heavily armed freighter money can buy. Rumour is that it's even used by some pirates as a raiding ship. It is named after the HMS Rawalpindi, a legendary armed merchant cruiser that was destroyed on Earth more than a thousand years ago. Although naming something after a destroyed ship does not seem like the best business model, you are assured that, since many people struggle to pronounce the name, let along know of its namesake, there is very little impact on its sales."
