name Zone.of.Control
about "Provides a proper way to tribute human space after finishing the main plot without needing to save-edit (Free Worlds) or being dependent on time slots during campaign (Republic & Syndicate). Also handles independent systems by defining own polities to avoid issues with independent mission NPCs. And adds some vanilla mission chain related candy."
