			`The elders of the Skadenga and the Ranfolk voted to pay tribute to the deeds of Skadamarkadi, the one "marked by Skade", and to give support in the further voyage across the endless skies on the search of adventures to be besung in sagas which future generations will know as Edda Skadamarkada. May 800 credits a day be of good use on your path.`
