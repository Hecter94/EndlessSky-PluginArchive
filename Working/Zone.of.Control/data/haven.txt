			`You receive an encrypted message via the "Routed Onion Telemetrics" system. Only one person knows your onion address, so you transfer the message to a separate second-hand computer, type ******** into the password prompt, solve some tricky gotchas personalized on information only you and the sender can know, like birthdays, pet fur color and endearments, insert your keys -- literal ones, not alphanumerical ones -- and finally have 30 seconds to read before the message destroys itself and the computer.`
