			`The tales of your good deeds throughout the Deep start to become part of Norn's folk culture, with the usual exaggerations.`
			`	You can't remember to have saved Skaldgar from falling into a volcano on Helheim, descending with a white-painted ship from a smoke-filled sky like an angel, triggering his regret and wish to make amends with his family. You doubt that you have melted through two kilometres of ice on Hope just to place Tosti's family stone.`
			`	And you assume that you would have known if you had fought Ice-Slugs on Nifel or Shark-Krakens on Windblain with bare hands. But at least you have saved a "maiden in distress", though you're pretty sure, that Hjlod would scowl at how the story is told on Norn.`
			`	Anyway, the community councils decide to pay tribute to your contribution to Norn's society and culture, and will pay you a lifelong pension of 500 credits a day.`
