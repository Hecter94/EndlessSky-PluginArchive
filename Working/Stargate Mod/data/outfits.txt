	description "This data chip supposedly contains information on 12000 star systems closest to this one: planets, ports, governments, trade prices, available services, etc. Unfortunately it seems to be limited, perhaps some sort of damage, it is 10,000 years old after all. You can get all the same information just by exploring those systems yourself, but having a map can save you from making wrong turns if you are trying to travel through new territory to reach a certain system quickly."
