			`You see on the display that it has accepted your input and your personal vessel is being constructed.  The room is once again filled by the neutral voice.`
			`"While we wait for your ship to finish being constructed, you should make sure to allocate the remaining funds to repair the damaged portions of the station.  If you do not, the status of this station will continue to deteriorate and the cost of repairing it will increase."`
			`You hear a loud 'ding!' sound from the terminal.  Soon after; with a whirring of giant motors, your brand new Seeker model of reconnaissance vessel slides into view.`
			`"Please take this vessel and venture through the wormhole in this system to human space.  There you will engage in light commerce until you can afford to use this facility to construct a proper fleet."`

			`"Humans are unused to seeing non-human sentients in their space, so I have allocated for your use a device that will trick their simple neurology into recognizing you as one of them.  You will find it on the small shelf near the airlock on your way out.  All of your ships will be equipped with this technology, so you needn't worry too much about humans getting curious while you're away from your ship.  Would you like for me to offer suggestions pertaining to your next course of action?"`

			`"You could,` 
			`A: Check the job boards for passenger, escort, or cargo transportation missions.  This will be a simple and easy way to earn money in the short term, but this vessel's limitations will affect your earning potential.  Still, it's very safe, as this vessel is fast enough to outrun most pursuers.  If you are escorting other vessels, your pursuers will likely ignore them in favor of the possibility of capturing an alien vessel.`
			`B: Engage in piracy.  This vessel is uniquely equipped to sneak up on vulnerable targets and disable them.  You can then plunder a small amount of the target's valuables before sneaking away again.  This method will be faster than taking jobs, but you will gain the attention of the human governments, and you may want to wait until you are stronger to show your intentions to them.`
			`C: Join a military faction.  Human space is highly factionalized, and their military branches are always looking for new captains.  Especially when those captains possess a vessel such as this one.  The military will pay you for operations you complete for them on top of providing a modest salary.  This method is slower than piracy, but will place you in position to strike at the humans from within their organizations.  I have predicted that war will break out soon in human space, and the humans in this section of space will be in particular need of a captain such as yourself.`
			`Always check the spaceports for lucrative opportunities, and remember that if you sell your ship and buy a human ship, it could be a very long time before you are able to return to Relic Station."`

			`	As you initiate your landing on <origin>, your communications panel lights up and you are greeted by the familiar, neutral voice of Oracle.`
			`	"Greetings, Captain <last>.  While you've been busy I've been searching for anything that might be of use to you.  I think I've found something."`
			`	Your navigation console blinks to life and you see it start to lock in on a set of coordinates that Oracle is sending you.  It looks like a planet to the far south of space; <destination>.  The display zooms in on the planet, taking you near the northern pole.  The display continues to zoom in before switching to a cut-away to show you an object buried a few hundred feet beneath the surface.`
			`"I'm reading a faint power source  buried under the northern ice cap that matches a [data corrupted] power signature.  I would suggest setting a course for Pherkad at your earliest convenience.  Much of the information in my databanks is either corrupted or out of date.  Any lost technology you can recover will greatly benefit our cause."`

			`You set down at the spot that was indicated on your navigation console.`

				`"Oracle, perform a high-intensity scan of the site."`
			`"Scanning now, Captain."`
			`You hear a faint humming noise from the hull of your ship as Oracle performs a deep, probative scan.  A moment later, the humming stops and Oracle's voice fills the cabin again.`
			`"The object is buried deep under hundreds of feet of ice.  It appears to be intact.  Judging by size and power intensity, I'm guessing that this is some kind of data storage unit.  If the data is intact, I'm certain I can make use of it to further your cause.  It appears to be sheltered under a derelict ship hull.  A few well placed blasts from your ships weapons should melt the ice without damaging the datavault, but we would need take the shot from orbit.  Shall I initiate a takeoff sequence?"`
			choice
				`"Do it."`
			`Oracle fires up the drives on the <ship> and you go hurtling into orbit.  The moment you break through the planet's atmosphere, the brakes fire and your ship spins about to face the planet.  Oracle takes a moment to line up the shot, which you can watch on your targeting computer, before the weapons flash to life and bolts of energy go hurtling towards the planet.  The impacts are too small to see from orbit until Oracle zooms in on it for you.`
			`"Direct hit, Captain <last>.  I'm showing that the object has been uncovered, and all [data corrupted] technology is intact.  Setting us back down now."`
			`You set back down on the surface and prepare to retrieve the storage unit.`
			`"You may want to consider donning a protective suit before leaving the ship.  The environmental conditions outside are extremely hazardous."`
			`You hear a loud hissing noise as a panel to your right rotates outwards, revealing a chrome, segmented suit of armor with an awkward looking cubic helmet.  Despite it's appearance, you find that the suit is incredibly comfortable once it's on, and the moment the helmet clicks into place you hear it pressurize and a full AR experience blinks to life in front of you.  As the airlock unseals in front of you and swings open, you realize just what Oracle meant.  The blizzard outside is impossible to see through and the howling winds are almost deafening.  Still, you're able to make your way out of the ship and stumble along the lit path towards the impact site.`
			`You would think that snow and heat would make water, but it must be too cold for it to have remained a liquid.  You do see the dull grey hunk of metal sticking about thirty feet out of the snow though.  As you get nearer you see that a large section of it is missing, and there's a path leading inside the derelict vessel.  The cavity is only a few cubic meters, and the module glows a faint orange color against the snow towards the back of it.  It looks a bit like a giant camping lantern.  You grab it and tuck it under your arm, heading back out into the blizzard.`

			`As you're pulling yourself from the derelict ship, something hard smashes against the side of your helmet and your world turns sideways as you're tossed to the ground.  You see a human standing over you, wearing a standard protective suit.  You barely have time to put your hands up as he levels a large rifle at your chest and fires.  The burst of photons bounce harmlessly off of your chrome suit and dissapear into the clouds above you.  There's a brief moment when both of you are just staring at each other before you snap out of it and grab your balefire weapon from your belt.  You hit the button on the hilt and slash outwards at the stunned human.  The energy field strikes him between the legs and slashes upwards along the length of his body and across his face.  Blood and steam spray from his head and torso as he's tossed backwards into the snow.`
			`You're watching the steam rise from the corpse in front of you when you hear a crackling of energy, and several bolts impact with your shoulder, chest, and head.  The force sends you careening backwards.  You fall to your side in the deep snow, and you can hear and feel the force of more energy bolts striking the ground around you.  A small red figure in the corner of your HUD indicates that the armor on your shoulder and helmut has been compromised.  When you sense a pause in their firing, you spring to your feet and race towards the small cluster of humans.  Looks like there are four of them.`
			`You feel something powerful and ancient welling up in you.  Your legs kick harder against the snow as you're filled with a sudden drive and desire for violence.  The next volley of gunfire is easily avoided by a dash to the side, and then you're on them.  It's almost like you're just a passenger now.  Your weapon comes crashing down on the terrified humans sending limbs and clumps of unidentifiable tissue in all directions.  One of them manages to get out.`
			`"Jesus, it's a fuckin' androi..!" before you shove the energy field through his back.  He has just enough time to look down before his chest explodes like a grenade went off inside of it.  Your hand flicks the field off and returns the weapon to your belt.  And like that, you're back in the pilot's seat (so to speak).  You walk slowly towards the glowing orange object sitting in the snow where you left it.  You reach down to pick it up when you hear someone yell from behind you.`
			`"Grenade!"`
			choice
				`Look Down`
			`A small, black lump of metal lands in the snow right at your feet.  You see the little green light on the side of it turn red and the only thing that you can think is 'Well, that's unfortunate'.  You see the grenade burst open and you feel pressure and pain slam into your body before everything goes black.`
			`It hurts.  You're laying on your face.  You're in the snow.  People are attacking you.  These are the thoughts that jar you awake again.  That and the voice screaming in your ear.  Oracle is so helpful.`
			`"GET UP, <first>!  They have the storage unit!"`
			`You pull yourself to your feet, pausing a moment when the pain tells you to.  You look up in time to see the trail of two Hawks taking off and booking it away from the planet.  Your own ship isn't far.`
			`"If they make it out of the system, the data will be lost and the humans will gain a technological edge.  DON'T LET THAT HAPPEN!"`
			`You make it to your ship and hop inside.  Oracle initiates the takeoff sequence the moment you're onboard.  You make your way to the pilot's seat and prepare to finish these humans off.`

			`	You land back at the station and cart the small device to the nearest info-port.  You plug it in and wait.  Your body reminds you that it's broken, but you have time to visit the medical facilities later; this is too interesting.  After several agonizing moments, that familiar voice once again fills the room.`
			`	"Some of this data has been corrupted; either by time or the fighting back at Pherkad, but it seems that at some point after my records end your ancestors were in a pitched war with another species for control of known space.. and they were losing.  This would help to explain why you are the only Sheragi left."`
			`	There's another short pause.`
			`	"I wasn't able to glean much else, but I did find a blueprint for a serviceable military vessel.  It'll take about 24 hours to repair the data.  When I'm done, I'll add it to the shipyard construction terminal.  I may also have a lead on some more technology, but it will take some time to pinpoint."`
			`	The voice leaves you and you are once again alone in the station.  Time to head to medical.`

			`This is the end of the demo.  Thank you for playing!  I'll go ahead and unlock some more toys for you.  This technology will unlock gradually in the full version.  Also, look out for even more weapons and ships!.. Maybe.`
