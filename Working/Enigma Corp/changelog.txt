V0.5.5
	New Content
		*Added a few attributes to Enigma stations for use in missions and to allow jobs to appear on the stations.
		*Added a new mission involving vandilizing Lovelace Labs that introduces the Freelancers, a new government that will be expanded upon later.
		*Added capacity upgraders for some newer weapons.
		*Added three new weapons: The Particle Blaster, Particle Repeater, and Modified Proton Gun, all created during the community pack frenzy that resulted in things such as the Gatling Gun and Solifuge.
		*Added three new ships to be used by the Hai, also created during the community pack frenzy. Not in any fleets yet.
		*Systems now include minable asteroids (Endless Sky v0.9.3 only).
		*Space Junk! (Endless Sky v0.9.3 only)
			*"Space Junk" includes two systems created to make the universe feel more alive and mysterious. These two systems are known as "Minable Junk" and "Spawnable Junk."
				*Minable Junk: Small abandoned ships like interceptors and light transports or freighters can be found floating around in uninhabited systems. These are long forgotten ships that have been left for dead by pirates. Shooting and destroying them drops outfits and scrap metal to be sold for credits.
				*Spawnable Junk: Every time you land on a planet, there is a chance that somewhere nearby an abandoned ship will be spawned. This can be any ship that normally spawns in the game, be it a Shuttle all the way up to a Republic Cruiser. 
			*There has also been two entirely new sets of human outfits that are variants of the normal human outfits. These variants are known as "Damaged" and "Salvagable."
				*Damaged outfits can not be installed and are a lot less worthy than their normal variants. All minables drop these damaged outfits and they are also what is most likely to be found on spawnable junk.
				*Salvaged outfits can only be found on spawnable junk and can be installed. They aren't worth as much as the normal variants and are less efficient in certain ways, but can be helpful in the early game if you don't have the cash to buy the normal version.
					*Disclaimer: All spawnables in this update have damaged outfits. The next update will see salvaged outfits being findable on spawnables.
		*A Dual Slicer Turret and Korath Disruptor Gun for the luls; can by found on a bunch of Mereti variants.
			*Because of this, the Mereti no longer ALL have minelayers, so fighting them isn't a total pain anymore!
		*Enigma Corp fleets now spawn in (almost) all human systems, the frequency of which decreasing with the distance from the nearest station.
		*Implemented my old "relocation" missions into EC.
			*Adds two new jobs to pick up near earth that involve you transporting large amounts of passengers to less populated planets. Bigger than colonizer jobs.
			*Adds a short mission that involves bringing escorting supplies to Earth under heavy pirate fire. Results in a temporary Navy license early in the game and gives Earth a sprites with a cool little thing on it (play the mission to find out what it is).
		*Added About and Readme files.
		*Created a new star sprite to be used in the Enigma system.
		*Animated Stars!
			*I've integrated my animated stars plugin into Enigma Corp, so downloading Enigma Corp now animates all the stars (systems from other plugins not included).
			*If you so desire, there is a .txt file that has deinstall instructions for the animated stars.
		*New explosion sprites to be used for special weapons and alien ships.
			*Changes the old Plasmathrower projectile sprites to be called "ion" and created new plasma sprites.
	Content Changes
		*The release of Enigma Corp technology is now on a timer instead of being based off of which campaign missions you have completed.
		*Redid a lot of the old outfit images so that I can have @2x versions of them.
		*Moved some old outfits from the beginning of the mod to Enigma Meridian. These outfits will likely be removed from the game due to them just being silly things I made to get into modding.
		*Changed the government reputations a bit.
			*EC like ORM.
			*EC no longer hate Test Dummies and Pirates.
			*ORM like Adamas and hate Pirates.
		*Renamed the Antimatter Bomb to the Antimatter Rocket.
		*Renamed a few of the systems in the Outer Rim.
		*Enigma Stations now all have the "Common Outfits" and "Basic Outfits" outfitters.
		*Enigma Prime now has the "Basic Ships" and "Lionheart Basics" shipyards.
		*Changed some stuff in the Navy License mission.
			*`on fail` dialogs that tell you that you ran out of time.
			*Less pirate and Navy ships during the final battle.
			*Pirates are no longer set to hostile if you for some reason are friendly with them.
			*Blocked and on visit dialogs in some spots.
		*Enigma Corp fleets are now less likely to spawn in the same systems as the Quarg, as the two factions are hostile towards one another.
		*Did some rewording in the Enigma Corp missions and rewrote Enigma Prime's descriptions.
		*Enigma Corp [1a] can now only be offered 10 days after dropping the EC CEO off at Enigma Prime
		*Move Enigma Zeta out of the Quarg visited system of Dahib and up to Betelgeuse.
		*Enigma Prime is no longer abandoned before starting the EC mission; they just won't let you land without 1 million rep.
		*Changed the fleets that spawn in the Enigma system; you'll now see actual Enigma fleets.
		*Declining Enigma Corp [1a] and [1b] now has the ships become available much later than if you accepted the missions, and declining Enigma Corp [1a] now allows you to still pick up [1b].
		*Enigma Corp [1c] now only gives you one Echo 78 escort and spawns a Quicksilver test dummy instead of a Firebird.
		*The Termini Appear event on offer condition switched from "free worlds plot completed" to "main plot completed."
		*Added final explosions on the ships, which I forgot to do for v0.9.2
	Balance
		*Rebalanced the capacity upgraders a lot to now compensate for ammunition mass.
		*Reduced the cost of Shrapnel Canisters (4000->1000).
		*Increased Missile Turret mass (15->18) as well as renaming it to the "Sidewinder Missile Turret."
		*Buffed the Hellfire Missile's lifetime by 50% (120->180).
		*Completely rebalanced all the Enigma Corp ships in the game so far. They are now not all top of their class and mainly are stock fitted with Navy gear (Ion engines and the many fusion/fission reactors). See full details in commit c3760a4.
		*Resized a lot of the Echo ships, as many of them were bigger than they should have been. See full details in commit 8bba4ca.
		*Buffed (nerfed?) the heat damage of the Cryo Beam (-0.1 -> -10) and set its disruption damage to positive.
		*Changes the mass and cost of the Hellfire and Flux missiles
			*Flux: 0.15 mass -> 0.25, 1200 cost ->1500.
			*Hellfire: 0.2 mass -> 0.1, 900 cost -> 350.
			*These changes also alter the mass and capacity of their respective launchers and capacity upgraders. Check commit b0a7550 for full details.
	Bug Fixes
		*Moved the position of Termara in order to avoid a bug with the game engine. (@KevinKorzekwa)
		*The usual typo fixes.
		*Fixed some errors that were popping up in errors.txt.
			*Fixed a quote error on the Viper description.
			*Fixed an error on a few missions where fail was used instead of decline.
			*Fixed an error where "reputation required" was used instead of "required reputation."
				*If the above error persists after updating then it has gone to your save file. Go to your save file and search for "reputation required" to replace it with "required reputation".
		*Diamond Station is now a more appropriate distance from the planet it orbits.
		*Put parentheses around choice actions in some missions for consistency with vanilla.
		*The Typhoon Capacity Upgrader now properly appears in outfitters.
		*The Termini Appearence event now properly sets the fleets of the affected systems to what they should be after the campaign instead of before it.
		*Fixed the name of the Thunderhead Capacity Upgrader in sales so that it will be purchaseable now.
	Misc
		*Removed @2x images from the folders. All @2x images are now locate within zip files in their respective folders.
		*Created a copyright file.
		*Added a file in to the mod that will only be useable when the World Forge mod is also downloaded. It makes Enigma Corp outfits and ships appear on the Mods and Forge planets, as well as some of it being on the Human planet.
		*Removed useless Thumbs.db files.

V0.5.4 and a half
  Content
    Replaced the Decoy Engines with X1025 Ion Engines.
    Termini Drones are now automaton and uncaptureable.
    There is now a station in the Enigma system called "Enigma Meridian" that holds within it stuff that is purposefully OP and unbalanced as well as some ships that you aren't normally suppose to be able to buy
      This is just for testing purposes. Go ahead and mess with the stuff if you want. It will be gone in v0.6.0. :)
    Enigma Corp and ORM no longer fine you when you have illegal outfits and cargo.
    The Sadr-Immeo wormhole now has a path for your pathing ai to use.
    Added new systems located in the Outer Rim to be used in a later update.
    Updated the navy license mission for v0.9.2 compatability. You must start the mission line within 60 days of completing the main plot and finish it within 90 days of completing the main plot.
    Reworked the "New Syn Tech" mission to require you to return some cargo that is found on the NPC to the Syndicate instead of just boarding it.
      Declining this mission makes the core pirates stronger.
      Declining this mission also triggers the event, which would normally be triggered upon completion, after 60 days.

      Declining this mission also triggers the event, which would normally be triggered upon completion, after 60 days.
    Reworked Enigma Corp 1C so that you can actually make the Dire Hawks cloak.
    Reworked many of the descriptions for ships and outfits.
    Capacity upgraders are now abbreviated as "Cap-Up" instead of "Cap. Up."
    Capacity Upgraders are now categorized as "Ammunition" instead of "Systems."
    Removed old Echo 7 images and the Legacy Echo images.
    Removed the Smartbomb because it's trash.
    Plasmathrowers are no longer sold at Enigma Corp outfitters
    Changed the Reinforced Plating and Shield Overcharger names to have their class be at the end of the name as to make them appear next to eachother in outfitters
  Balance
    Plasmathrower now also does some heat damage.
    Ammunition has been given mass and weapons that require ammo have had their mass reduced.
    Antimatter Bombs and Crew Implants are now illegal. Like really illegal. Like "I'll kill you for possessing one of these" illegal. Like 50 years in jail for possessing 2 grams of weed in America type of illegal.
    The Shrapnel Cannon now has a random velocity and random lifetime to it so that the pellet spread is not the same every time.
      Pellets do more damage (62.5 -> 75), but have less hit force (100 -> 50).
    The Rocket Launcher has had its attack and defense reduced to be equal to that of two frag grenades.
    As a result of the Rocket Launcher change, Incendiary Grenades have had their attack and defense both buffed.
    Halfed the Arc Discharger's fire rate (60->30) but also doubled the rest of the stats to compensate.
    The Antimatter Bomb missile strength changed (1000-> 0, aka indestructible).
    The Cryo Beam now does negative heat and disruption damage.
    Rebalanced the Plasmathrower to be a direct upgrade to the Flamethrower in damage instead of an alternative, but it comes at a much steeper firing fuel requirement.
    Increased Flux Missile Launcher's shield (40->75) and hull (5->15) damage, as well as the turn value (4->5)
    Lowered MDS burst count (300->50)
    Increased Hellfire Missile Launcher reload time (20->24)
    Reduced Sentry Drone mass (200->120) and drag (100->5.4)
    Reduced Orca weapon space (300->210) and it is now sold with Laser Turrets instead of Heavy Laser Turrets.
    The EMP Device can now only be used on the Star Guardian.
    Forge Cannon reload time decreased (900->600), hit force increased (250->750), and firing force increased (100->250).
    The Repair Turret now has 100% piercing so that it can be used through shields.
    All mine placers have had their trigger and blast radii reduced (75->40 and 85->50 respectively).
    Increased Flux Mine Placer (35->50) and Flux Torpedo Launcher (10->20) ion damages.
  Bug Fixes
    The usual typo fixes (thx Alkallid and Takarada)
    Fixed the Echo 50 engine coordinates.
    Fixed the Echo 99 gun port coordinates.
    Better Andromeda galaxy image.
    Fixed a bug that caused a random system with nothing in it to appear at position 0,0.
    The Star King and Star Guardian are now sold with the proper amount of Flux Missiles.
    Any weapon that had a homing of 10 now has a homing of 4

V0.5.4 Missions and Compatibility
  New missions
    Introductory missions for the Andromedans and Termini that hint as to the direction of both storylines.
    Mission line that involves you assisting in rebuilding the Geminus shipyard that was destroyed before the war. Gain access to purchase your very own Navy ships, including the Carrier and Cruiser!
    Mission with the Enigma Corp to unlock new technologies for your use and their profit. Earn the right to purchase new and improved versions of Enigma Corp ships.
  New ships
    EC-001 ‘Badger’ drone. Developed by Enigma Corp as a competitor to the Republic Navy’s Combat Drone. Bigger, better, and more expensive.
    EC-070 ‘Star Guardian,’ an even better version of the Star King, the Star Guardian was developed to protect the most important of individuals on their travels through space. It is also fit with a special EMP device that shocks the electrical systems of all nearby enemy ships, allowing the Star Guardian to escape with no problems.
    EC-078 ‘Dire Hawk,’ a stealth version of the ‘Dire Wolf’ that has a built in experimental cloaking device and even more space for weapons.
  New weapons unlocked through missions
    Seeker Laser, a strange weapon that fires a beam of protons that track targets.
    Missile Denial System, a highly energy taxing weapon that demolishes any missiles that enter its range.
    Cryo Beam, freeze your target’s ship into submission, leaving them completely helpless as you destroy them.
  New Images
    Almost all the ships that have been added are getting a blender makeover from Wrzlprnft.
  New Sounds
    Shrapnel Cannon (not working)
    RE Skylance
  Changes, Tweaks, and Misc Additions.
    Enigma Stations have governments to them.
    Removing the Echo 7s due to the addition of Southern Carriers in v0.9.0.

    I’ve reformatted some of the mission files to help organize. 
    The Syndicate Technology mission now requires you to board the target instead of blowing it up. 
    Fixed some spelling and grammar errors in the mission where you meet the Enigma Corp CEO. Thanks Toilethinges. 
    I’ve connected the Enigma system to a different system. This is because Laconda (or something like that), a system from Shields Up, was also attached to Wezen and would sever the link with Enigma depending on which plugin was loaded by the game first. 
    Korath Destroyer
      Removing it due to it being completely useless thanks to me making reverse engineered jump drives purchasable. 
      On a similar note, the RE jump drive now has slightly weaker stats than the normal jump drive (0.9 jump drive from 1, 0.25 jump speed from 0.3)
    A rare Drak Archon will sometimes appear watching over Enigma Prime
    There are now Enigma Corp merchant fleets that can sometimes be seen around Syndicate space and near Enigma stations.

  The Grav Bomb now actually costs something (double oops)
  Changes and Tweaks
    Increased repair turret nanite capacity (1000 to 1200)
    The Gravitational Wave Generator and Grav Bomb are now listed as secondary weapons to make them easier to control when you actually want to push or pull your opponents or random merchants.

  Real quick compatibility fix with Shields Up; there were two systems with the same name.

V0.5.3 Descriptions, Spaceports, and Some Other Stuff
  Outfits with no descriptions now have descriptions
  All 5 Enigma Stations in human space now have descriptions for the station and the spaceport.
  I’ve added some labels to the map, because why not. They totally look like they’re part of the vanilla game.
  Reworked the explosions of the new ships to be more like their categories.
  Changes and Tweaks
    Reduced the hull penalty of the external fuel pod from 100 to 99 in order to avoid a bug that I found.
    The Enigma Corp government is now colored green instead of black.
    Enigma Prime now has both Deep Sky Basics and Advanced outfitters, as well as Enigma Epsilon
    The Repair Laser projectile has been changed to new “slow laser” technology, and has gotten a 50% hull repair rate buff (300 to 450).
    In response to recent events, I’m nerfing all hand to hand weapons. They will all have slightly lower attack (0.1 to 0.5 less, depending on the item) while also increasing the cost.

V0.5.2 Weapon and Systems Balancing
  Added a Grav Bomb, the reverse of the Gravitational Wave Generator
  There’s also a Warp Inhibitor in the weapons.txt that I haven’t implemented yet. Check it out if you want.

V0.5.1a Hotfix
  Resized the Aegis and Rattlesnake images to better fit their roles 
  The Rattlesnake was way too big for a medium warship and the Aegis felt too small
  You’ll need to rebuy your Aegis and Rattlesnakes to fix any offset engines and weapon hardpoints.
  Fixed some of the capacity upgrades to work now
  Flux Missile cap. up.
  Thermite torpedo cap. up.
  Flux torpedo cap. up.

V0.5.1- Ship Balancing
  Balance out every ship in some way, shape, or form. Not going to post it all because it would take up like two entire pages and be pretty pointless.
  Gave the ships some new descriptions.
  The Orca now explodes when it dies
  The Dire Wolf is now labeled under light warships
  The Wolf Bomb Bay can no longer be placed on any ship other than the Dire Wolf

  Orca description now says 6 turrets instead of 12
  Fuel Powered Generator is now listed under power

V0.5.0- Alien Invasion! (not really though [kind of])
  2 new alien factions!
    The Andromedans: a newly discovered wormhole is leading pilots to the Andromeda Galaxy, somewhere where no one has been before. Upon arrival, pilots have occasionally had run-ins with an unknown alien race that have been dubbed Andromedans. They are hostile to anything that is not their own, and are immensely powerful.
      Upon further investigation, it has been found that the Andromedans are somewhat of a primitive species when it come to their technology. They have never discovered anything more powerful than combustion engines or ballistic weaponry, and do not even posses shield technology. Because of this, the only way that their civilization has been able to advance is to make their ships and weapons even bigger. Andromedan ships have massive hulls and extremely powerful weapons, but they have very little range and are rather slow due to their technology and size.
      Given the massive need for raw materials and energy in order to sustain the Andromedan society, any planet that is deemed uninhabitable is immediately marked off for being mined away. The sheer amount of raw materials received from mining away entire solar systems is only barely enough to feed their massive empire. Stars too are sucked up of every possible drop of energy, having gigantic Dyson Sphere around many stars, with most still seemingly under construction or left to remain in their unfinished state.
      It is unconfirmed whether or not Andromedans possess faster than flight travel, as no one has ever witnessed one of their ships entering or exitting a system through any warp or hyper drive system currently known, and they seem to salvage any hyperdrives and warp drives that they find as they prey upon hopeless explorers. As such, it has been speculated that Andromedan lives last many millennium if they are able to hold together such a massive galactic empire without faster than light travel. 
      Lately, Andromedan ships have been rarely seen entering the Milky Way through the same wormhole that explorers are entering Andromeda through. They appear for just a short while before returning back through the wormhole, but this alone is unsettling to some and seems to indicate that the Andromedans are preparing to enter the Milky Way with a strong force.

    The Termini: little is known about the Termini, as they have only been recently sighted flying around human space, starting shortly after the end of the Pug War. Some claim to have seen Termini scout ships, which is only what we can assume they are, flying out of the wormhole that was left behind by the Pug. None of the other alien races that we are able to contact have any information on the Termini. One can only hope that they are here for peace and not war. 
      Both alien species ship sprites courtesy of Millionth Vector’s blog.

  Story Changes
    I’ve removed the conversation you have at Enigma Prime for the time being. Will be reintroduced in the story update of v0.6.0.
    There are now 5 Enigma Corp stations located throughout human space that unlock new technology through the story campaign.
    Enigma Prime is now only unlockable after the main story has been completed. Head towards your nearest friendly neighborhood pirate planet and hang out around the spaceport.
    Two missions that unlock new technology after the main campaign has been finished. Ask around the Deep and Syndicate space for two separate missions. 

  9 new ships (and a drone)!
    EC-007 Carrier and EC-007 Civilian Class Carrier, for those who want a carrier of their own without needing to steal some navy license or attack navy ships.
    EC-031 ‘Viper,’ EC-032 ‘Rattlesnake,’ and EC-033 ‘King Cobra.’ Three missile warships in three varieties: light, medium, and heavy in that order. Fitted with more gun hardpoints than most ships of the same size and above average shields, but lower armor.
    EC-037 ‘Aegis,’ a medium and heavy warship mix. It’s the size of a medium warship but has the weapon capacity of a heavy warship, making it an interesting ship to fly.
    EC-050 ‘Orca,’ the newest in freighting technology, having more cargo space than any ship to ever come before it. 
    EC-069 ‘Star King,’ the best of the best when it comes to luxury.
    EC-077 ‘Dire Wolf,’ a stealth bomber fitted with exclusive torpedo launchers that can out damage any other torpedo launcher currently on the market.
    Sentry Drone, a heavy, nearly immobile drone that can be fitted with any turret currently available on the market.

  More new outfits than ever before!
    Hand to Hand
      Breaching Shotgun, an interesting new take on boarding weaponry
      Rocket Launcher, more effective than a grenade thanks to its increased range
      Portable Flamethrower, a highly illegal weapon used only by the most ruthless of individuals
    Guns
      Plasmathrower, a version of the Flamethrower that does ion damage.
      Flux Missiles, Sidewinder missiles modified with a flux explosive that causes a decent amount of shield damage and some ion damage.
      Thermite and Flux Torpedo Launchers, launcher versions of the thermite and flux mine placers
      Shrapnel Cannon, a huge space shotgun.
      Arc Discharger, channel the energy of your ship directly into a weapon, ionizing the shields of your opponents.
      Fuel Rod Launcher, have any extra fuel? Fire it at your enemies!
    Turrets
      Reverse Engineered Skylance, as simple as it sounds. A version of the skylance that isn’t as powerful or efficient, but heck, what else are you going to use?
      Forge Cannon, a long range artillery weapon that does massive damage upon impact but takes a long time to reload.
      Energy Transfer, as a flagship, you can transfer unneeded energy to your escorts if they need it.
    Power and Cooling
      Heavy Water Coolant System, a more effective water cooling system that takes up the same amount of space
      Atomic Batteries, 50% more energy capacity at 200% the cost.
      Blackhole Reactor, Red Star Core, and Cold Fusion Reactor, just a ton of new energy generating systems.
      Fuel Powered Generator, convert your unused hyperspace fuel into energy if you need a little boost in the middle of combat, but beware the massive heat generated from the process.
  Bug fixes, balance changes, and other small stuff
    Most of the double spacing in the code that was caused by me using normal Notepad has been removed. If there’s any files with a lot of extra spacing, go ahead and point them out to me.

v0.4.2- More balancing and changes
  Antimatter Bomb and Hellfire Launcher have new images
  Reduced the Hellfire Launcher range (3750 to 3000)

  Renamed the weapon and engine expanders to weapon and engine expansions, to keep it in line with “mass expansion” and “cargo expansion”
  Removed the Anti-Drone Turret and replaced it with a Smart Bomb.
  The Smart Bomb is a proximity explosion that damages ships within a radius around the main ship. Strong enough to take down drones in one hit (if they’re close enough) but has a long reload and high energy requirement.
  Put some stuff in the files for later on. Check it out if you want.

v0.4.1- Balancing Patch
  Cost changes:
    Increased the cost of nanites (100 to 250)
    Increased the cost of Hellfire missiles (750 to 900)
    Reduced the cost of the Missile Turret (150k to 75k)

    Reduced the mass of the antimatter thruster and steering (now exactly 20+ outfit space compared to that of the best atomic engines)
    Changed the weapon and engine expanders to match the stats of the mass expansion (now 20 cargo space for 15 weapon or engine space)
    Increased the space of the antimatter launcher (50 to 55)

v0.4- The Adventure Begins
  New Enigma Station description and a first contact mission with Enigma Corp, which replaces the old station description.
  New conversation when you first visit the Enigma Station spaceport that introduces the first story arc of this mod. :)
  Weapon Capacity Upgrades! Increase the total amount of secondary ammo you can carry for a specific weapon.
  Thermite mines! Mines that do a small amount of damage but a large amount of heat damage, causing most ships to overheat.
  Gravitational Wave Generator! Harness the power of two black holes colliding in order to produce a gravitational wave strong enough to push your enemies away. Also helpful for pushing away disabled ships that you want to save for later. 
  Repair Turret! Fire this special turret at any ship you want (preferably friendly) to quickly repair their hull to full. Also helpful for getting allied ships back into the action without needing to board them under fire.
  Some bug fixes and balance changes
    The Ion Mine placer doesn’t hold infinite mines anymore (not exactly sure if that’s something I accidentally made happen while going through the code or not, but I’ll just say it anyways).
    Mines from the mine placer will now stay still. They will eject out the back of your ship then grind to a hult, making them useful for when you’re getting chased.
    The Ion Mine is now in the images, so you should be able to see it without needing Pompano’s mod.
    Doubled the damage of explosive mines
    Hull and Shield upgrades cost a lot less
    Moved the Ion Mine Placers from Syndicate to Deep Sky; Syndicate will own the thermite mines.
    Balanced out the Scram Jump Drive stats (didn’t exactly mean to add it in the previous update so it wasn’t balanced at all).
    Doubled the turn radius of the hellfire missiles to compensate for the lack of range now
    I also moved the data files around to make them more organized and easier to look through.

v0.3 - Images!!!
  I’ve put new images on almost all the things that I’ve added so far! Hope you enjoy! Just don’t look too close and they’ll be good. :)
  Resized the pocket wormhole image to not eat up half the images beside it.
  Fixed some more grammar and spelling issues. Hopefully I’ve fixed all the issues so far.
  Did some rebalancing of what I’ve added. 
  Antimatter bomb takes even less energy to fire now, but the capacity has been halved
  The Hellfire Missiles no longer have more range than the Meteor Missiles
  Tweaked the proximity detonation ranges on the two mines and changed the descriptions of the mine ammunition to something more… descriptive
  Balanced the cost of a few items
  Buffed the two new defensive hand to hand outfits
  Balanced a few system outfits out, such as halving how much mass reduction the exotic matter plating gives.
  And a few other things that I probably forgot.

v0.2 - Hand to Hand Combat & Improved Customization
  Weapon and Engine Expanders, that sacrifice cargo space for weapon and engine space.
  Incendiary Grenades, stronger than nerve gas and just as illegal.
  Plasma and Rail Rifles, two hand to hand weapons that are upgrades to the normal laser rifle
  Plasma Deflector and Personal Shield Generator, two new defenses for you ship.
  External Fuel Pods, give you as much fuel as a normal fuel pod but are attached to the outside of your ship. Pretty sure that’s a hazard during fights.
  And available only at Enigma Station
  Antimatter thrusters and steering, even better than atomic engines, and yet another thing stolen from the Quarg.
  Exotic Matter Plating, plates made of exotic matter, matter with negative mass. Reduce the mass of your ship for more speed!
  Warp Afterburner, an afterburner so powerful that you’ll reach warps speeds in milliseconds.
  Adjustments/Changes
  Fixed some grammar issues
  Tweaked the stats on some of the weapons to balance them out more
