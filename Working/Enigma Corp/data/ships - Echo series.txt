	description `The Badger was the first of the Corporation's ships that did not use a stolen design. Created to compete against the Republic Navy Combat Drone, it is the strongest drone currently on the galactic market. Equipped with three gun hardpoints and double the hull strength, the Badger can pack a huge punch. Although, some critique the Badger for being very slow and large, making it an easy target.`

Nothing more than a huge metal box filled with targetting computer and a single turret hardpoint placed on the top, the Sentry is a rarely seen drone that can be very useful in numbers, but due to its large mass and low engine capacity it is a rather easy target to hit and does not last long in large battles."

	description `The Enigma Corproation's "Missile Series" of ships was the first to gain reasonable public acclaim, mainly from those who enjoy using missiles over laser or blaster weaponry. The Viper was the first in this series to be released to the public. Similar to the rest of the ships in the Missile Series, it greatly emphasizes shields over hull compared to normal human ships and is designed to have a very low drag compared to ships of the same size. It has also been praised by many for its niche design of using Lovelace Labs' new Missile Turrets and having a built in missile storage system for carrying even more missiles.`

	description `The Aegis was the first ship from the Corporation's "Mythos Series" of ships that was made available to the public. A mix between a medium and heavy warship, it is in a rather odd place. On one had it is the size of a medium warship, but on the other it has enough weapons to compete against many heavy warships. But some tend to shy away from this beast, as all that extra weapon space come as the cost of sustantially less engine capacity.`

	description "The Orca is the mother of all haulers, able to carry twice as much cargo as it competitor, the Bulk Freighter. It does this by packing the cargo as tight as humanly possible and converting much of the space that would normally be used for crew quarters and other facilities into cargo space. Although, this makes the Orca come at a heavy cost of over 43 million credits for the hull alone, as well as making the Orca a large and slow target that can have trouble defending itself."

	description "After the mixed reception of the Star King to the public market, the Corporation began work on a new design that sought to create a perfect luxury transport ship that could also double as a warship. The Star Guardian is the result of that. The pinnicale of luxry transport, the Star Guardian is better than the Star King in every way and also comes specially fitted with an EMP Device designed to get you out of the stickiest of situations. The newly designed EMP Device scrambles the power systems of nearby enemy ships, allowing for the Star Guardian to quickly warp out of the system while recieving little damage."

	description `This ship was a venture into the widely untouched market of bomber technology. The Dire Wolf is an advanced bomber fitted with the strongest of torpedo technology: Enigma Corp's new Wolf Bombs. These weapons are stronger than any other torpedo technology on the market, making the Wolf a formidable foe. This power comes at a cost, though, as the Dire Wolf is clearly one of the weakest ships in its class when it comes to armor and shields.`

	description "One of the main critiques with the Dire Wolf was its low amount of armor in shields, leading to a quick death in most situations. As a result, the Corporation began work on making a new bomber that would be able to withstand much more fire. They ended up creating the Dire Hawk. This ship is exactly the same as the Dire Wolf in almost all ways, except for one important part; the Dire Hawk comes fitted with a prototype cloaking device. This cloaking device allows for the Dire Hawk to avoid taking damage if used correctly, making the Hawk more deadly than the Wolf could ever be."
