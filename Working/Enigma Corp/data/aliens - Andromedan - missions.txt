			`As you land your ship, you notice a rather large crowd in the middle of the spaceport. You walk over to try and see what is going on. As you make your way through the crowd, you begin to hear what sounds like an old man screaming.`
			`	"THEY ARE COMING! THE END TIMES ARE NIGH!"`
			`	You finally get to the center of the crowd to see a greasy old man in rags, covered in god knows what.`
			`	"JUDGMENT DAY IS UPON US ALL!" He continues you yell while spazzing out on the concrete. `

			`	You walk up and grab the old man on the shoulders to keep him steady.`
			`	"What judgement day? What are you talking about?"`
			`	"THEEEEMMMMM!!!" he says, while extending a single bones finger out towards the core of the Galaxy.`
			`	"Who, the Korath?"`
			`	"NO, NOT THE KORATH. THE KORATH ARE WEAK. THE KORATH ARE WITHERING. IT IS SOMETHING ELSE. BEINGS FROM ANOTHER GALAXY!!!"`

			`	Before you can ask more, a group of security guards pushes you out of the way and drags the man off. The crowd disperses, and you can still hear the old man's screams at the edge of the spaceport.`

			`	You get up and walk away, assuming that the old man is just crazy. As you walk back to your ship you can see a group of security guards dragging the old man off into a building at the edge of the spaceport. `

			label continue
			`	You decide to wait and see what else he has to say without getting too close.`
			`	"THE BEINGS FROM ANOTHER GALAXY!!! THEY ARE ARRIVING TO TAKE US ALL!!!"`
			`	The crowd begins to murmur, wondering what this old man could be talking about. `
			`	Just then, a group of security guards pushes through the crowd and drags the old man off. The crowd disperses, and you can still hear the old man's screams.`
