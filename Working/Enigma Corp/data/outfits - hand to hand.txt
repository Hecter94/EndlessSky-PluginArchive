	description "As with chemical weapons, incendiary weaponry for use on organic beings in prohibited by interstellar law. Incendiary grenades are considered just as illegal as nerve gas, but back a much bigger punch when used offensively. Although, do to their nature they actually harm you when used defensively. It turns out that burning your own ship from the inside is never a good idea."

	description "A plasma rifle is the direct upgrade to a laser rifle, providing both more offensive and defensive power to your crew. Instead of firing a beam of high-powered light, a plasma rifle fires a small burst of plasma. This burst, although traveling at slower speeds, has much more stopping power compared to that of a laser and without the proper protective material can leave severe burns on the target."

	"unplunderable" 1
	description "Rail Rifles see a return to the days of old when ballistic weaponry was the main form of combat. Smaller versions of the same Particle Cannons that are used on ships, they fire a high-speed kinetic round that is able to punch through even the toughest of protective materials. The one drawback of Rail Rifles is that they require much more precision to be useful, and therefore are not as useful as a defensive weapon when you are being rushed by enemies."

	description "Plasma Deflectors were created shortly after the introduction of plasma rifles to the public market and are the direct counter to any plasma weaponry. The deflector works by utilizing the electromagnetic properties of plasma against the aggressor and sending the plasma burst right back at the shooter. Although, the Plasma Deflector takes a large amount of time and energy to activate, making it good for nothing more than a defensive item."

	description "This is a specially designed shotgun to be used in small ship corridors. Considered overkill by many, the shotgun is loaded with flechette shells that increase effectivness at medium range and tear through any protective material with ease."

	"unplunderable" 1
	description "As with fragmentation grenades, handheld rocket launchers are just barely considered legal. Rocket launchers have a similar explosive yield to that of a fragmentation grenade, but the ability to launch a rocket a longer distance than a grenade can be thrown makes rocket launchers a much better offensive weapon. "

	description "As with chemical weapons, incendiary weaponry for use on organic beings in prohibited by interstellar law. Given the wording of the law, flamethrowers have been allowed to be used as large ship weapons, but are highly illegal when made man-portable for the use of boarding and capturing ships, even when used against pirates."
	description "Able to do the work of more than eight laser rifles, portable flamethrowers are highly sought after by boarders all over the galaxy."

	description "After the terrors of the first Alpha Wars and the out right ban of the genetic engineering of humans, a number of corporations attempted to create new super soldiers that bypassed these bans. Their solution was to use biometric implants in order to create humans that were stronger, faster, more intelligent, and still retained their human emotions. Governments at the time feared that this too would lead to a war of the super soldiers, so human augmentation of all kind for the purpose of war was banned. This ban has remained in the law for hundreds of years, but some corporations still try to push the boundries of humanity by continuing to create biometric implants. "
	description "These implants increase a crew member's mental capacity and enable them to interface with a ship's computers, allowing them to do the jobs of multiple people at once. Crew members with implants also experience an increased reaction speed, allowing for better combat effectiveness."
