outfit "Heavy Water Coolant System"

	cost 50000
	thumbnail "outfit/heavy water cooling"
	"mass" 10
	"outfit space" -10
	"cooling" 14.1666666666
	description "The heavy water cooler is essentially the same thing as a normal water cooling system, but instead filled with heavy water. Heavy water is similar to normal water, except that it contains dueterium instead of normal hydrogen connected to the oxygen atom, which increases the density of the water, making it possible to have more water in the same area. This means that a cooling system using heavy water can cool more with the same density of water."
	description "Disclaimer, this is not entirely accurate. Do not believe everything you read on the internet. Don't drink and drive. Stay in school. Say no to drugs."

	"energy generation" 17
	"heat generation" 25
	description "Cold fusion is a type of fusion that requires much less energy and heat to occur, as oppsoed to normal fusion which takes the energy of a star to make happen. This means that a cold fusion reactor will produce much less heat as compared to a normal fusion reactor."

	"mass" 145
	"outfit space" -145
	"energy generation" 27.2
	"heat generation" 90
	description "The Red Star Core drains power from a contained red dwarf. Draining the energy of an entire contained star produces a lot of energy, as well as a large amount of heat."

	"energy generation" 36.66666
	"heat generation" 120
	description "The Blackhole Reactor works by tossing matter into the black hole and feeding off of the heat created by the accretion disk. This yields a massive amount of energy, but also causes much more heat compared the energy generated than other power generators."

	description "For when youâ€™re in the heat of battle and need some extra energy, say hello to the Fuel Powered Generator. Fire this thing up in the middle of battle to convert your hyperspace fuel into useable energy. Especially useful for those with a lot of fuel but not much space for batteries or reactors."
	description "Due to the massive amounts of heat generated when in use, the generator requires the use of one of your ship's gun ports to be used as an exhaust port to let out all the heat."

outfit "Heat Sinks"
	category "Systems"
	cost 7500
	thumbnail "outfit/known"
	"mass" 3
	"outfit space" -3
	"heat dissipation" 0.05
	description "Heat Sinks are a cheap alternative to cooling systems. Instead of increasing the cooling rate of heat on the ship, they increase the amount of heat in which a ship can withstand before overheating. Intended for smaller ships that are not expecting to be in combat much."
