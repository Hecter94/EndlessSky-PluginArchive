					goto shoot
						
			label chop
			`	Before the figure reached you, you karate chop it in the neck region. It crumbles to the ground with a grunt, and attempts to get back up.`
			choice
				`	(Wait.)`
					goto wait
				`	(Shoot to kill.)`
					goto kill
			
			label shoot
			`	You quickly pull your laser pistol and fire at the figure. The laser fires straight through it, and the figure cripples down on top of you. As you push it off of you, it grunts, still barely alive.`
			choice
				`	(Look at what it is.)`
					goto see
				`	(Shoot to kill.)`
					goto kill
						
			label kill
			`	You aim for the head of the figure and pull the trigger. It crumbles back down to the ground, completely unmoving this time.`
				goto leave
			
			label leave
			`	You drag the body behind the crates so that no one sees it and go on your merry way.`
				decline
			
			label wait
			`	You decide to wait to see what happens next. The figure removes the hood from its head while standing back up, revealing the face of a young looking man.`
				goto introduction
				
			label see
			`	You remove the hood from the figure to reveal the fast of a young looking man. Before you can even react, He quickly grabs you by the neck.`
			`	"What... The... Heck..." he mutters. The man lets go of your neck and reaches into his pocket. He pulls out what looks to be a pen of sorts and sticks it into his wound. The wound quickly heals, something that you have never seen before.`
			`The man gets to his feet, putting the pen object back in his pocket.`
				goto introduction
				
			label introduction
			`	"That's one interesting way to introduce yourself. Hi, I'm Jon. You must be asshole." He says with a smirk as he extends his hand.`

					goto shake

					goto triggerhappy
						
			label shake
			`You extend your hand to shake his.`
			`	"The name's <first>," you say, remaining weary of the man's movements.`

				goto choice
			
			label triggerhappy
			`	You pull your gun up to fire, and with an almost inhuman reaction time the man makes a quick grab for your gun. Before you're even able to think about pulling the trigger, he already has the gun in his hand.`
			`	"Calm DOWN there kiddo. All I want to do is ask you something."`

			`	"I'm not sure if you've noticed, but there appears to be a number of interestingly new ships flying around near that wormhole that those Pug fellows left behind. Now supposedly, someone has spotted one of them sitting around doing absolutely nothing in Vega. I was wondering if you could fly out there and see if you can board it, look at what it's got inside, and come back here to tell me what you find."`

					goto me
				`	"Why can't you do it yourself?"`
					goto why
				`	"No, why should I do anything for you?"`
