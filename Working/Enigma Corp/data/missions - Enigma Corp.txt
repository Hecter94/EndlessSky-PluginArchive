			`	He begins walking toward you, pistol still in hand. "I have no idea why you would run, but it makes me think that it isn't safe enough to keep you alive."`

			`	"As of right now, we have two new ships that need a bit of combat testing. Both are variants of ships we already have out on the market, but they include special features meant for only the most important of individuals."`
			`	"The first one, the EC-070, is a combat version of the EC-069 'Star King.' It comes specially fitted with an EMP device used to scramble the electronics of ships that happen to get too close to the ship, allowing for safer travel from pirates. Pirates warp in and get to close? Set off the EMP and jump out ASAP."`
			`	"The second one, which is going to need a few more weeks of preparation before we're ready to put a human inside of it, is the EC-078, which is just the EC-077 strapped without new prototype cloaking device."`
			`	"The device is rather large at the moment, which is why it needs to be integrated directly into the ship. It works by increasing the gravity around the ship using harvested dark matter, allowing the ship to bend the light around it and become almost completely invisible."`
			`	"So, would you be interested in helping to test them?"`
			choice

Go up there, disable his ship, and board to to look at how the ship was damaged by the EMP device. After that, do whatever you want with him and come back here with the data."`
