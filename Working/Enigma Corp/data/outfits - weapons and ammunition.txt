The resulting lightning storm deals large amounts of shield damage and disrupting the energy systems of any ship that it hits, draining much of their energy."

	description "Although not available to the wider public, the Enigma Corporation has a plethra of weaponry and other outfits that are based off of stolen alien technology. The Antimatter Launcher is likely the most destructive weapon in existance, using the power of a Quarg Antimatter Core and converting it in to a useable weapon. With enough explosive yield to level half a star system, the Antimatter Launcher requires a specially fitted capital ship to even fit and fire."

The large amount of energy that is released greatly heats up the core, requiring a cooling time after being fired."

The kinetic force of the slug landing on a target causes a massive explosion, dealing large amounts of damage and knocking back the ship that it hits. Due to the size of the slugs and the power at which the projectile is launched, they are slowly loaded into the barrel of the weapon and time must be taken for the cannon to charge, leading to rather long reload periods."

This however causes the beam to be even more incoherent, reducing its accuracy and range, but also increasing its total potential damage."

This turret takes advantage of nanites used to repair the hull of a ship and fires them through space using new "slow laser" technology. The slow laser carries the nanites to their target where they begin to work away reparing the hull of the ship that they land on.`

The weapon acts like a normal laser, but fires the lasers in burst instead of in a constant stream. This results in multiple sections that are indepedant from eachother. These mini laser sections then somehow seek their target, moving at speeds so fast that they are nearly impossible to dodge."

This allows for considerable amounts of damage to be dealt up close, but makes the weapon almost completely useless at range.`
