	description "This data chip gives you what every ship should already have installed in it: a map of the entire galaxy. Or at least what we know of so far. Back in the early days of space piracy, a few pirates were angry that their ships didn't already have maps downloaded into them and that they needed to go exploring everything to fill the map. So instead of doing things legally, they stole maps from disabled Republic ships and started replicating them. And since not all pirates are heartless, they actually sold them for next to nothing! Can you believe that?"
