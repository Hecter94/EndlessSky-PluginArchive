# Enigma Corp
Enigma Corp is an ever expanding mod that takes you through the adventures of the Enigma Corporation, a strange and greedy corporation that has only just recently surfaced onto the open market and is already doing big things. Both an outfit development and ship creation company, the Corporation has taken the market by storm, introducing new and exciting things to the general public that have never been seen before.

Although, some say that Enigma Corp's rise to power was not done cleanly, claiming that they steal secrets from other companies in order to gain an unfair edgy on their competitors. And rumor has it that they have dark connections with alien races, allowing them to develop the amazing things that they do that recently seemed out of humanity's grasps. But are these rumors true? Only you can find out!

Enjoy playing with dozens of new outfits and multiple new ships, as well as exploring the over 40 new systems that this mod adds in the Milky Way alone. That's right! There's more than just the Milky Way in this mod! Where will your travels take you? Find out today!
