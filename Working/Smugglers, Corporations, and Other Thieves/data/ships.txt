	description "'Blockade fleets have to be everywhere all the time; blockade runners can come from anywhere, any time.' -- The Ghost Runner's design team took that idea to its logical extreme - maybe even to an absurd extreme, depending on which rumors you believe. Operating with a skeleton crew, this vessel boasts high-performance engines, optimized exhaust output, standard-equipped interference plating and plentiful outfit and cargo space, but very little room to augment its pitiful offensive loadout. Its defenses are on par with a medium warship, however, and they include a revolutionary anti-missile system from which it derives the other half of its moniker. Heavy missile volleys will definitely tax the ship’s default power core, but that’s what the afterburner and scram drive are for."

	description "It's a long-standing tradition of smugglers to refer to the ships of either side of a major conflict as 'angels' or 'devils,' with the latter epithet reserved for whoever's currently blocking, scanning, taxing, or shooting at them. It was only fitting that the Hermes Foundation would borrow the terminology when finally forced to develop a combat-oriented vessel. The Fallen Angel is an agile, lightweight craft ideally suited to hit and run tactics. Its default loadout certainly emphasizes that role, though it would be very unwise for a lone pilot to risk using the Overloader very often. Removing it does open up some additional options for expanding the vessel's engines and weapons, though only by a bit."

ship "Geist"

# So yeah, this my pet OP ship that shouldn't be available to players, except maybe after endgame. Surprisingly, it's actually not
# ridiculous, save for the huge boost to capture attack value. I like it. You can try it out if you want.
# You'll find that it really hammers home some of the game's odd quirks, like how low cargo holds on your flagship
# severely hamper the plundering lifestyle. Like many of my ships, I'd hoped to make it a bit smaller on the screen,
# but way too much detail was lost.
# FUTURE PLANS: Some kind of phantom double that's effectively unkillable but can fly around sniping missiles?
# Not very practical given what I know how to do so far. Would ideally involve a weapon with no ammo and a long reload time that could 
# launch temporary ships.

	description "The Geist is a terrifying achievement in advanced systems integration, sacrificing almost all modularity for maximum space efficiency. Its only distinct, removable parts are its weapons (and a ramscoop in its default loadout.) The ship was designed in service to a singular purpose: to quickly de-cloak and hammer an unsuspecting victim with a burst of raw firepower, hopefully disabling or destroying it before it's able to return fire. While the Geist's shields are strong, it is uniquely vulnerable to weaponry that targets armor. Thankfully, its specialized equipment also allows it to bug out of dangerous situations quickly, either by re-engaging its cloaking systems or fleeing the hot zone entirely. A squadron of these warships could change the balance of power in human space, but the resources required to build more than one would be staggering."

	description "The Apex Industrial Solutions Zenith is marketed as the 'first true capital class warship,' much to the annoyance and chagrin of the company's competitors. Still, the technical specifications do provide some plausible support for the claim: unlike the Bactrian, it was designed from the ground up to house primarily combat-oriented systems. Trading available ports, mounts and fighter bays for even more outfit space, the Zenith can handle a full loadout of the galaxy's largest weapons. Its only serious limitation is its engine space, though it's also worth noting that, like most A.I.S. offerings, its space-efficient design forces it to rely upon shielding far more than raw hull strength for defense."

	description "The Apex Industrial Solutions Meridian class carrier demonstrates once again that the company isn't interested in half measures. While the vessel still boasts a reasonable amount of anti-missile and anti-fighter firepower, much has been stripped away to make room for as many fighter bays as possible. It was vital to the Meridian's designers to pass the theoretical 'tipping point' where a lone carrier's fighter complement could serve as a competent defensive fleet, and the marketing department assures you they were successful. A Meridian supported by a proper fleet, meanwhile, serves as an unrivaled long-range offensive asset."

	description "The Apex Industrial Solutions Equinox Class warship is absolutely a placeholder in the company's top-heavy (or is that heavy-heavy?) product line, primarily serving as a flying advertisement for its proprietary Oscillator Beam technology. Its designers did make a few bold decisions to distinguish it from its nearest competitors, though, and the toughest one for management to swallow was the inclusion of extra gun ports to attract captains who prefer smaller, more widely available forward-fire weapons. Overall, the Equinox holds its own against a Megaparsec Quicksilver, though its default loadout will force its captain to watch her energy reserves and heat index a bit more closely."

	description "The Apex Industrial Solutions Crescent class warship is what their sales department refers to as 'affordable,' which is code for 'feel bad for not buying a Zenith or Meridian.' Still, this medium warship packs quite the punch, and boasts exceptional maneuverability for its classification. Its default loadout suggests an oversized fighter more than a warship, but the standard Blaze Beam could be swapped out for an Oscillator Turret. With a bit more tweaking, it could serve quite well as a slower, more defense-oriented support vessel."

	description "The Apex Industrial Solutions Nadir Class fighter is unusually fragile even by the offense-oriented company's lax standards. Every possible corner was cut to mount it with a single proprietary beam weapon, leaving its pilot with little choice but to engage in hit-and-run flybys from maximum firing range. Its minuscule energy reserves will only allow for a few precious seconds of simultaneous thrust-and-fire, making it the riskiest fighter in the galaxy to climb into. As one might expect, the AIS marketing department has thrown down that gauntlet with aplomb, challenging the 'best fighter pilots in the galaxy' to roll the bones."

	description "The Exodus is, surprisingly, extremely small compared to the design that inspired it. The full-size version was intended to be a true worldship, capable of sustaining an entire ecosystem whilst hurtling through space towards an uncolonized planet. The advent of hyperdrive technology made such ships obsolete overnight - a tragedy, considering how many were already en route to distant stars - but a niche market for sustainable long-distance travel remained. The Exodus cannot compete with the Star Queen's host of amenities, but it does boast more passenger and cargo space in addition to a massive fuel reserve and standard ramscoop. Its firepower is downright anemic for a craft of its size, which is why its default loadout emphasizes fast jumps and bursts of speed."

	description "The Triton Class heavy warship pushes the limits of Deep Blue Sky's Hyperfoil® technology, lending exceptional maneuverability and hull strength to a massive hunk of centu-folded material. The Triton's relative nimbleness opens up all manner of loadouts that would ordinarily prove suboptimal on such a large vessel. The inclusion of three fighter bays was a clear signal to the Republic that the company would be receptive to an exclusive contract, to which they would almost certainly add their own proprietary fighter craft."

	description "Deep Blue Sky's Wavecurl fighter was designed as a showcase for the company's Cloudburst Turret, and any pilot who's taken one for a spin around the solar system will tell you that trying to aim a standard weapon while steering the wafer-thin chassis would have been a fool's errand. The vessel's Hyperfoil® body can take quite a bit of punishment compared to other fighters, but its shield strength is minimal. Deep Blue Sky strongly recommends that flybys be conducted at maximum speed and with no turning radius. That's what the turret is for, after all."
