	description "Floating mysteriously between a turret, a hyperdrive, and a hologram projector, the Ghost Integrated Missile Defense System - or 'The Ghost' for short - gives missiles exactly what they want: a target. As to how, exactly, it achieves that feat… well, its designers have surreptitiously encouraged all manner of outlandish rumors, including wild theories involving alternate dimensions, subspace tearing, and unrealized quantum states. Clearly that’s all science-fiction claptrap, but pilots are a superstitious lot, and ‘independent couriers’ aren’t above stoking a bit of panic to help them push through a blockade. After all, who wants to risk getting sent to an alternate reality over one lousy cargo shipment?"

	description "The Gemini Cannon is an extremely space-efficient and energy-efficient weapon that can quickly devastate enemy shields. It leverages the phenomenon of quantum entanglement on a heretofore-unprecedented macro scale, generating unstable projectiles that travel quickly, though with some deceleration downstream. It is, however, an incredibly heat-inefficient weapon, which other development teams within the Hermes Foundation have elected to treat as an opportunity rather than as a shortcoming."

	description "The Overloader is a coup-de-grace weapon that is fully expected to (wait for it) overload the firing ship's systems. Ideally, it will do the same to its targets, as well as melt their hulls, while the weapon's negative thrust pushes the assailant to (relative) safety. As an added benefit, the weapon provides a small amount of persistent cooling, though pilots crazy enough to use an Overloader generally don't care about traditional heat management. The LW01a model produces the maximum heat and negative thrust deemed safe for a light warship class vessel - though you're beginning to notice that Vulcan Team's definition of 'safe' seems... liberal."

	description "The Blaze Beam is Apex Industrial Solutions' response to the stagnant, wasteful 'more ports, more better' philosophy of combat ship design. Rather than fire continuously, it cycles through a dedicated supercapacitor to deliver truly massive blasts. While it's quite competitive with smaller weapons ton-for-ton, it only truly shines when installed aboard an A.I.S. capital vessel, which are specifically designed to maximize output on a per-port and per-mount basis."

	description "The Oscillator Beam is Apex Industrial Solutions' proprietary answer to the Particle Cannon, leveraging a smaller and less stable version of the technology used in their Blaze Beam. Beyond the beam/projectile distinction, the differences between the two competing weapons are negligible. The Oscillator requires less energy, generates more heat, and its profile is biased more towards armor damage, but few captains are likely to notice the differences. This weapon is very clearly a product of capitalism and is in no way a significant scientific achievement. AIS's marketing gurus have even tried championing its aesthetic superiority, which reeks of desperation."

	description "Nothing has spurred more turnover at Apex Industrial Solutions than their development teams' continued inability to port Blaze Beam technology over to a capital-class turret. In the meantime, their Oscillator Turret still claims the title for the heaviest, longest-ranged, and most devastating auto-aimed ordinance in human space. The reckless overlapping of the twin beams multiplies their destructive force, but also causes significant heat blowback onto the firing mechanisms."

	description "Deep Blue Sky's Cloudburst Cannon sacrifices the pinpoint accuracy of a laser for some added punch, though its range is quite limited. Unsurprisingly, it's best-suited for a craft that is both highly maneuverable and resilient - something that can get in close and take even more punishment than it delivers."

	description "Deep Blue Sky's Cloudburst Turret is something of an anomaly; rather than mounting multiple copies of its signature cannon onto a swivel mount, the company elected to customize a single unit with a dedicated heat sink and capacitor, allowing it to fire more rapidly and at a slightly higher velocity. The unorthodox design makes it a perfect fit for their Wavecurl fighters, but any captain looking to do a point-blank flyby should strongly consider installing them."
