			"Hey, I was eighteen; I thought the word 'poot' was funny. I'll admit things got out of hand."
			"Silent. Deadly. You might say that 'but' is my middle name."
			"Don't worry; most ships like mine aren't quite as overpowered."
			"So now that I have a cloaking device, where to first? Venus, or Uranus?"
			"So did you hear the one about the open-source space game? It's all about stealing credits. Do you get it? Do you? DO YOU?"
			"I made funny noises with my mouth and now they're laser guns. What a time to be alive!"
			"I sure do love com-poot-er games... eh, I've heard it both ways."
			"Whatever space band you like sucks."
			"I hate whatever stardate today is."
			"I'm looking for a woman who really appreciates gas giants but isn't obsessed with rings."
			"Size matters, unless you're willing to make your own plug-in. Hey, it's just like real life!"
			"So, read any good gray-on-gray text aaaaaalll the way on the left side of your screen lately?"
			"Fart noises for engine sounds...that could work... did I mention I have a law degree from Harvard?"
			"Set your lightsabers to stun!"
			"I tried making fun of a Star Wars fan, but he remained unphased."
			"Arrr! Swizzle me timbers!"
			"If you're looking for a good trade route, try searching for your dignity in your mother's purse."
			"Apex Industrial Solutions' ships and guns are very powerful, but remember that you can be held liable in space court for melting all of those panties."
			"Deep Blue Sky's Hyperfoil is the most advanced hull material in the galaxy, and is in no way an excuse to show off larger ship sprites."
			"The Hermes Foundation named itself after the patron god of thieves, which I'm sure was an accident."
			"Hey, that's a nice looking ship! Mind if I fiddle around with the rear exhaust port?"
			"The White Helix Group is so mysterious that it really doesn't make sense for me to be mentioning them at all... so forget I said anything."
			"I'll have you know that space-plant creatures are a part of my cultural heritage! Science, schmience!"
			"Special thanks to the Blender, Audacity and GIMP creators and communities! No, this one's serious, guys. Not joking. They're great."
			"If you're reading this message, capitalism has failed. Somebody created and distributed something with no expectation of financial reward. EVERYBODY PANIC!"
			"Why are the Hai so suspicious? They're always keeping their ion everything."
