# Arrr, Mateys!

## What is it?

A bunch of missions and stuff to give folks something to actually *do* on the pirate worlds in [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io).  Many of these things actually have an impact on pirate opinions, giving players a proper "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" option.

## What sorts of fun things can I do?

### Which ones are already implemented?

* Smuggle illicit substances (namely: drugs) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle illicit multimedia (namely: pirated software/videos/music) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle counterfeit goods out of pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the near future?

* Smuggle illegal immigrants out of pirate worlds
* Transport isolationists to pirate worlds
* Deliver medical supplies / luxury goods / etc. to pirate worlds
* Smuggle slaves into / out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle weapons into pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the not-so-near future?

* Some pirate-centric mini-storylines (or perhaps a Pirate-centric main storyline)
* A pirate-centric alternate start (probably part of the above)

## What's the license?
