# Star-Wars-Map-in-Endless-Sky
The current goal is to have every system from Star Wars Legends placed as accurately as
possible (within reason), and to have sector borders, trade routes, and important
astronomical features such as the Void of Chopani labled.

Delete the ui folder in images if the background looks like garbage in-game.  Anything
contained in there is meant for development, and will make seeing anything very difficult.

The images shown in the background are screenshots from http://www.swgalaxymap.com/
The orange systems are systems that appear in Canon, and the blue systems are systems
that appear exclusively in Legends.  Many of the most important systems such as Hoth
and Byss appear in both Canon and Legends, and are thus orange.  For this reason, some
orange systems have been added to the map while others have been left alone.

Most systems do not have exact locations given in any official map, and liberty has been taken in a few
instances where perfectly accurate placement of systems would result in unreadable system names due to
how close together those systems are.  See the Tharin sector for an example, the space in and around the
Periphary region in particular.  It can be searched for in game by searching for the Dles system just above
Hutt Space.  Note how the systems in that area do not line up with the systems on the inserted screenshots.

Every system in the main Endless Sky map is included in the map.txt with the exception of Rutilicus*.
This is because a number of systems in Endless Sky have the same name as systems in Star Wars, see Rigel
and Capella as examples.  In these instances, the systems have been renamed to be slightly different from
what they actually are in Star Wars.  Rigel has been renamed Rigellia after the Rigellian race that are from
Rigel, and Capella has been renamed Greater Capella due to the presence of the Little Capella system in the
same sector.

Also included in the "Basic Outfits" are a handful of maps that will make exploring the SW galaxy not
become a massive and unbearable chore that takes about an hour even with 1,000 fuel processors and a JD,
yes I have done that before and I am still salty that I didn't just add the map outfit in the first place.

Because the current map does not have any inhabited systems, a very...potent ship will be required to
navigate the galaxy.  Included is a save file that has a ship that will be able to navigate the galaxy with
relative ease.  Note that it does not have a JD.  This is because the map is not designed with a JD in
mind.  The map was designed with the Star Wars trade routes in mind, and thus funnels players to the trade
routes rather than allowing them to roam freely as a JD would allow for.

* The Rutilicus system is not present so that it is still possible to access the Omnis plugin galaxy if you
have the Omnis plugin installed.

~36% of systems are in place, with 5785 systems expected to be the final count.
