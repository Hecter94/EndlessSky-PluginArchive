Soon enough you see a Quarg appears on the news warning that this my be the beginning of something horrible, an event far worse than humanity ever faced. They fear that these ships are mere scouts for a larger invasion fleet.`

			`	You find somewhere to hide along with the people who were stuck here as everyone else with a working ship tries to escape. Soon enough you hear multiple explosions coming from the spaceport as it got saturated with gunfires from the invading ships, even if your ship survives you surely wouldn't, there's no way out now. Through the security cameras someone happens to have access to you watched as the massive Ultaka warship lands crushing everything else beneath it and deploy swarm of oval drones with oversized guns and what's essentially a large gun with two legs. There's some resistance around the spaceports outnumbered and outgunned all got torn to atoms along with their covers and whatever is behind them without even scratching the invaders. The cameras goes offline one by one until eventually you were found by the invader.`
