# About
Ultaka Invasion (or lengthier its name Ultaka Invasion of Milky Way) is an experimental plugin where Milky Way is invaded by highly advanced alien, featuring mechanics for planet invasion and allowing player to retake planets and hire warships to defend it. No story planned beside small missions to make factions react to the invasion(mostly WIP).

Just for fun, not recommended for regular gameplay as multiple feature might break vanilla missions and the balance is very questionable.
