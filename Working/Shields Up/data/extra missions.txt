			`After easing your ship into the large hanger bay, you exit your ship and are soon met with the prying eyes of a man wearing a black suit. He aproaches you and you get a good look at him: brown hair, blue eyes; you also can recognize the smell of alcohol emanating from him. He begins speaking in a somewhat slurred voice:`
			`	"Hey, Captain <last>! I noticed your ship coming in for a landing over there." He attempts to point in the direction of your ship, but mistakenly points at a tiny fighter parked a few feet away. "I must say, you've certainly downgraded from whatever warship you used in the war there, but I guess I won't judge."`
			choice
				`	"Oh, that's not my ship."`

				`	"Are you drunk?"`
					goto drunk
				`	"Do I know you?"`
					goto know

			label ship
			`	You attempt to explain to him how that wasn't you ship, but he simply dismisses it and continues on. "So I've heard about all your..." He struggles to find the correct word, but finally comes up with a replacment, "Job doing, and I was thinking you could maybe help us out." He stares at you in silence, and just as you're about to respond, he starts talking again. "Great! So listen, we're planning on colonizing a planet out in the Teshana system, and we need a guy to go and kill all the pirate guys there, you got it? There's this one asswipe going around blowin' up all our shit, and we need you to kill him. Maybe even some of his buddies as well."`

			`	You reply to him, telling him you'll help. He smiles, then walks away mumbling something completely impossible to understand.`

			label deny
			`	You tell him quite calmly that you will not be assisting him the matter, and he sticks up his finger and calls you a "Filthy Commie" whatever the hell that means.`
				decline
				
			label drunk
			`	He quickly (attempts) to look you in the eye; "I have never drank a drunk before in my life" you decide not to mention his obvious mistake in that sentence, and instead try changing the subject;`

				`	"So, who are you?"`
					goto mission
				`	"Why are you talking to me?"`
					goto mission2
				`	"Do you even know where you are?"`
					goto mission

			label mission
			`	His head tilts sideways, and he looks you dead in the eyes; "I got a favour to ask of you, so listen." he gesures for you to move closer. You hesitantly take a step forward. "Okay, so those big guys in the Deep" he gestures to the roof, "want you to do them a favour."`
			choice
				`	"Don't avoid my question!"`
					goto mission2
				`	"Uh, okay sure. What is it?"`
					goto mission2

			label mission2
			`	"So those big guys in the Deep. The higher up guys. The ones who do all the things. They have this little planety thing out in the Teshana system, and it's all grassy and stuff. They want people to live there, so you gotta go an' kill all the pirates, you know? 'Cuz they keep shooting all our dudes."`
			choice
				`	"You want me to help you colonize a planet?"`
					goto colonize
				`	"Don't you have your own military?"`
					goto military

			label colonize
			`	He rocks his head back and forth. "Yeah, pretty cool huh? So go on, there's this one annoying captain who keeps leading all these raids, so why don't you start with him, maybe even kill some of his little buddies while you're at it. It'll make it easier for when we do the whole 'people need to live on the planet' bit."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, I'll help you."`
					goto help
				`	"No thanks, I'm not gonna help."`
					goto deny

			label military
			`	You remind him that the Deep has an entire military designed for purposes such as this, however the man is not amused. "You think they got the time to do all the dumb jobs? We give those jobs to the expendable people and the people that we don't people." You stand, dumbfounded at the sheer stupidity of his last statement, and shake it off as just that.`
			choice
				`	"You know what? Fine. I'll help you."`
					goto help
				`	"I'd much rather not lose any more IQ's, I won't be assisting you."`
					decline

			label know
			`	He slouches his head down, clearly drunk. "Probably not, but I know you, I've been having a ship tail you for days."`
			choice
				`	"You what! I'll clock you right now!"`
					goto clock
				`	"I highly doubt that"`
					goto doubt

			label clock
			`	He puts his hands up in a shrugging motion. "Oh please, don't act like this is the first time anyone's done that. Besides, that's not the point man, we have a favour to ask of you." You calm down a bit, and allow him to speak. "So, we've been paying close attention to all the stuff you've been doing, and I'll just let you know that the big guys up in the government want you to help them colonize this planet out in the Teshana system."`
			`	He stands around for a bit, staring at you as if waiting for a response. You ask him, "Care to repeat that?"`
				goto mission2

			label doubt
			`	He looks at you with his hazy blue eyes and says "But that doesn't matter my friend, since we know all about you, where you were born, what you do, and how you mindlessly float through space living in a ship without ever needing any food or sleep."`
			choice
				`	"Care to repeat that last part?"`
					goto repeat
				`	"You HAVE been stalking me!"`

			`	He ignores your question, and continues talking, "And so after that we decided we need something with all your skills and stuff."`
