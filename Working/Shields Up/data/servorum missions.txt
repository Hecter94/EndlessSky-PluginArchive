			`The beings here appear to be human, but are slightly different in many ways. Their heads are slightly larger in size and they are taller than most humans that you know of. A group of them approaches you with some sort of weapon in their hands and aim them at you..`

			choice
				`	"I come in peace."`
					goto peace
				`	"Don't shoot, I am just exploring the galaxy."`
				
			`	"For what reason? Many explore, but not all do so for good."`
			choice
				`	"I don't explore for anyone but myself."`
					goto lowers
				`	"I explore to expand my own knowledge."`
					goto lowers
			
			label peace
			`	"We've heard that one before."`
			
			label lowers
			`	The beings lower their weapons and the being that was talking comes out of the group to approach you. She holsters her weapon and shakes your hand.`
			`	"Clearly you are not against us, so we will give you the benefit of the doubt for now. Welcome to the worlds of the Servorum Dei, human."`
			choice
				`	"Are you people human?"`
				`	"What are the Servorum Dei?"`
					goto servorum
			
			`	The woman chuckles a bit before responding to your questions.`
			`	"It is difficult to tell. We once were human, but to call us human now would be an understatement."`
			
			label servorum
			`	"We are, or maybe it is better to say were, a group of scientists from the Deep. Many years ago during the Turf Wars, we tried to defy nature and genetically alter our bodies to greatly increase our intellectual capacity and to slow our aging processes. Clearly, we succeeded, but it came too late. Those that you likely know as the Alphas had been created and began to enslave many colony planets. We helped to defeat them, but the Alpha War resulted in a rather strong... distain for genetic engineering. Because of what we had done, we were essentially banished from human space. So now we live here, watching what occurs from a distance."`
			`	"So in short, we are not fully human. Generally, we refer to ourselves as 'Gammas.'"`
			choice
				`	"Times have changed. Why do you not return to human space?"`
					goto return
				`	"If you are Gammas and there are Alphas, then what are the Betas?"`
				
			`	"The Betas were similar to the Alphas, but they were not evil. They served aside humanity, just like us, only they looked like humans. They were able to better blend into humanity, thus avoiding persecution. Although, we do not know if any Betas are still alive to this day."`
				goto choice
			
			label return
			`	"We are not willing to take out chances. Maybe we would be allowed to return, but maybe we would spark a war. The stakes are simply too high for us to try."`
			
			label choice
			choice
				`	"May I purchase your technology?"`
					goto tech
				`	"Thank you for this information."`
			
			`	"You are welcome. And so you know, you may buy our smaller ships and outfits, but we do not allow others to use our more advanced technology until they have proven themselves trustworthy. If ever you have other questions, just ask."`
				decline

			`	"Some of it, but not all. You may buy our smaller ships and outfits, but we do not allow others to use our more advanced technology until they have proven themselves trustworthy. If ever you have other questions, just ask."`

			`	Landing on Kullat, you try to find the woman who you spoke to before. After asking around a bit, they point you to the main building in the spaceport. You are escorted to a room near the top of the building which overviews the entire spaceport.`
			`	The woman is sitting in a large arm chair while looking at three different monitors. Two of them are filled with lines of data that might be arrival and depature information. The screens rapidly scroll as more data comes up, and she seems to be taking it all in at the same time. The third monitor is displaying a simple game of chess, which she occasionally looks to to make her move.`
			`	The woman pauses the monitors and looks up to you.`
			`	"Hello, captain. I realized that I didn't get your name last time."`
			choice
				`	(Give her my name.)`
			
			`	"<first> <last>," you respond.`
			`	"Afternoon, Captain <last>. Given that I know your name, it is only appropriate that you know mine." The woman gets up from her chair and walks over to shake your hand.`
			`	"Hello, I am Delilah Sif, current prime minister of the Servorum Dei worlds. I believe I would be right to assume that you have a question to ask of me?"`
			`	You mention the purple wisp that you found in Agon and ask what it is.`
			`	"Oh, yes. The wisp. There is a rather long story to that object, but given the time I have I'll have to give you the short version."`
			`	"Back when we first left human space to colonize these worlds, that wisp was a wormhole. We expanded out to a cluster of systems in the southeast of the galaxy. Things were good early on, but then an alien race known as the Mil'taj came to our systems."`
			`	"At first they seemed friendly. They shared their technology with us and we exchanged stories of our people. But then Quarg appeared. These aliens began fighting the Quarg, and our people were caught in a crossfire. Some of us evacuated to these systems, but those who stayed were swayed to help the Mil'taj. The Mil'taj placed ideas into the heads of many of us that they would give us great technology to get revenge on the humans for casting us out, but only if we helped fight the Quarg. Some accepted, and the Quarg were run out of the systems."`
			`	"Those who remained in these systems north of the Deep did not like the idea of attacking the humans. A short war broke out between us and those that stayed with the Mil'taj, who began calling themselves the Plenipotent Dominion."`
			`	"After fighting to a stalemate and pushing all of the Dominion out of these systems, we severed the wormhole to keep the Dominion away from humanity, and that wisp is all that remains of the wormhole."`
			choice
				`	"How were you able to destroy the wormhole?"`
				`	"Are you afraid that they may be able to rebuild the wormhole and return?"`
				
			`	"It is much easier to destroy than to create. The technology needed to create a wormhole is far greater than that which is needed to destroy one. All we needed to do was drop a nuke right above the wormhole and detonate it. The resulting explosion shook the stressed space of the wormhole and caused it to snap. The Dominion will never be able to reopen the wormhole, at least not for the next 154,125,257 years."`
			`	"Now that I have told you this, I need to get back to work."`
			`	Delilah motions to the escorts to take you out, and they guide you back to your ship in the spaceport.`
