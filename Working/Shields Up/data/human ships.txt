	description "The cheapest transport ship to boast a turret, the Skybus is a fan favorite among the less wealthy of the galaxy. Some see it as an alternative to the Scout, as both have a similar capacity to hold passengers and have the same amount of weapons, but others chastise the Skybus for being too slow and unreliable when defending against pirates."
	description "	Although well-armed for its size and purpose, the Skybus is still advised not to wade into heavy combat, and instead to escape dangerous situations."

	description "The Vagabond is what happens when a Clipper has served its many crews well and faithfully for decades. Many of the parts have broken and fallen off, being replaced with bits and scraps from other ships. Parts of the inside have been opened up to provide more space and the outer hull has been hardened to compensate, but this has lead it to become more susceptible to overheating."

	description "	Using the chassis of a decomissioned Rainmaker as a base, the Vagrant is a popular ship in regions of space where the Navy rarely visit and therefore can not crack down on people using what is essentially stolen Navy technology."

	description "Perhaps, centuries ago, this ship was a Syndicate Heavy Freighter. It's a little hard to tell as its cargo holds appear to have fallen off and been replaced with hollowed-out asteroids and bits of miscellaneous ships."
	description "To be fair, although every Hulk has its ghost stories, time has been kind to this ship, gracing it with fighter bays, an enormous cargo capacity, and the means to defend itself against pirates -- and the seller assures you that the ship is not haunted in any way and the ghost stories are entirely fictional."
