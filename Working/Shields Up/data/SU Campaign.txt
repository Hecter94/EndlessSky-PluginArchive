			`	Immediately after landing, you are greeted by a man wearing a suit and tie with neatly combed hair. He seems like a friendly individual, and quickly introduces himself; "Hello there! My name is Dank, Dank Forrest." He extends his hand and you shake it. He then continues his introduction. "You seem like the kind of pilot with experience, which is why I'm entrusting you with something very important."`

			`	The man stares at you for a few seconds, as if trying to decide something. Some time passes before he appears to be content, and asks: "Have you heard of the Federation?"`
			choice

			`	He takes a couple steps closer to you. "Then I'm sure you know all about their highly advanced technology? Well, my client has discovered a rare stache of hidden weapons that belong to them. If you take me to the planet Icefall in the Menkar system, I can guide you to the stache."`

				`	"Alright, climb aboard!"`

				`	"No thanks, I'll pass up the opportunity to grab some amazing technology to be used for my own personal gain."`
					decline
					
			label "federation2"
			`	He smiles. "So you've not heard of the Federation and their highly advanced technology? The power their weapons possess can even dwarf the Quarg in combat! Basically, my client has located a massive stache of Federation technology. That means that if we can get there before any of our competitors, we get access to some of the best equipment in the entire galaxy. What do you say? Will you take me to the Menkar system? I need to get to the planet Icefall as fast as possible, you can take whatever tech you want once we're there."`

				`	"Alright, I'm in."`
					accept
				`	"No thanks, I'll pass up the opportunity to grab some amazing technology to be used for my own personal gain."`

			label "rude"
			`	The man is slightly taken aback by your reply, and an evil grin creeps up on his face. "Are you telling me that you are passing up the opportunity to get your hands on Federation technology? You know, the most advanced inhabitants of this galaxy? Because my client has found a stache of their rare weapons on the planet Icefall in the Menkar system, and any pilot willing to take me there is sure to get a large share of the contents of the stache."`

			`	You land in the main spaceport of the planet Icefall. The man steps towards the exit hatch of your ship that you had just opened. He takes a look back at you. "Alright captain, thank you for the ride!" He leaves your ship and disappears into a large crowd of crew walking along a strip of road.`
			`It isn't until you've been staring outside your ship which is decreasing in temperature to match the freezing temperature of the planet that you think: Did he ever tell you where that stache was?`
			``
			`	Back in your captain's chair you debate whether or not you should even give the deception even more thought when a blue light started flashing on your command console. You push the 'allow transmittion' button located next to the light and a cold female voice starts playing through the speakers located on either end of your console.`
			`	"Attention all pilots flying in Syndicate space, at this moment Syndicate forces are engaged in combat with a large fleet of advanced ships sporting the colours of the Plenipotent Dominion. It is requested that all civilians stay far away from Southern Syndicate space." Like that, the message clicks off as easily as it had clicked on.`
