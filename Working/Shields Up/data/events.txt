The Syndicate hasn't disclosed what exactly it was, but my bet is that it was a murder preformed by those damn Alpha bastards in the south-east. Killing that guy could only help the pirates and the Alphas, and I doubt the pirates even have the mental capacity to think to poison someone, they're just a weak lot of idiots if you ask me."`
