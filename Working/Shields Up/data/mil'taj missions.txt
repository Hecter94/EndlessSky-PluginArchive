			`Upon landing on <origin>, a small group of Quarg quickly approach you and your ship. They appear to be analyzing your ship as they look it over and speak in their own language. One of them begins to speak to your in your language.`
			`	"What is it that brings a human this far from Earth?" it asks.`
			choice
				`	"I am exploring the galaxy with my Jump Drive."`
				`	"Human space was too boring for me, so I am finding another place to be."`
			
			`	The Quarg begin to speak to eachother in their own language again, seemingly surprised that a human would have access to a Jump Drive.`
			`	"It would be most wise of you to leave this place and explore elsewhere, for these systems are no place for a human."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean by that?"`
					goto mil'taj
				`	"You can't tell me what to do."`
				`	"Understood. I will leave."`
					decline
			
			`	"It is your life that is at wish, not ours. But if you wish to be so stubborn, then do not be surprised at what comes your way."`
			
			label mil'taj
			`	One of the other Quarg begins speaking. "Near this region of space resides a species known as the Mil'taj. They are a violent race, likely more poewrful than anything you have viewed before."`
			`	"They were once a prosperous peoples, but they made the mistake of believing that they could defeat us, the Quarg, and as such, since we have no mission to protect them, we demolished them. Few are still alive today."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean that you have no mission to protect them?"`
				`	"Thank you for your time."`
					decline`
			
			label
			`	"The Mil'taj are not of this galaxy. They come from another, far from here, only in this galaxy due to a wormhole that appeared long ago. The Quarg only defend species of this galaxy and do not care for the species of others, especially not those who wish to destroy us."`
			`	You thank it for its time, and the crowd of Quarg that has been gawking at your ship slowly disperses.`
