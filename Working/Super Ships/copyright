Not really good at copyright stuff. The material in the mod is made by myself, and is distributed freely. I used the original Escape Velocity models as a reference, but these beautiful works of digital art are entirely my fault. It is not intended for sale, anyone using these for profit should pay me some :)

Anyone paying money for this should be shot. On the grounds of stupidity.
