	description "The United Earth Carrier is the powerhouse of the UE Navy. It carries an impressive compliment of fighters, turrets, and missiles. It is not as versatile as the destroyer, prefering to rely on ranged kill capacity to defeat enemies. If caught in the heat of battle, it can probably weather even the more ferocious of engagements."
