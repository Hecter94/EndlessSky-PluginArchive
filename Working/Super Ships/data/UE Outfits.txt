	description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the Blazer is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One Blazer is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

	description "A Blazer Turret is a pair of Blazers mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blazer Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."
