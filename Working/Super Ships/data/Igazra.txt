	description "The self-proclaimed 'Best warship in the galaxy', the Igazra isn't just hype. It it's lack of fighter capacity leaves it severely hampered, but it is equiped with three SAE launchers and five phase turrets. It is capable of ensuring the death of any enemy. It's shields, while not the fastest recharge, are an impressive bulwark against any enemy attack."
