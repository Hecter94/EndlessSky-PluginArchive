	description "The workhouse of the United Earth Navy. The destroyer is a solidly reliable weapon platform. It has a good range of upgrade cpacity, weapon availability, and combat worth. While there are many more dangerous ships in the galaxy, the Destroyer follows the standard philosphy of the UE Navy. Biggest bang for your buck."
