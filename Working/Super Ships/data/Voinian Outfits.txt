	description "A Blaster Turret is a pair of Energy Blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "Heavy Rockets are the most powerful missile weapon available, but at a price: instead of having a homing system, they simply fire straight forward and rely on a proximity trigger to set them off. Once triggered, however, they damage all ships within their blast radius, making them highly effective against clusters of fighters."
