	description `The Quantum Slipstream Drive, nicknamed the "Slip Drive", combines the ability of the scram drive to jump while moving, but allows ships to travel between systems without a hyperlink connection. A slipstream is a narrowly focused, directed field that is initiated by manipulating the fabric of the space-time continuum at the quantum level. This creates a subspace tunnel, which is projected ahead of the vessel. Once a ship has entered this tunnel, the forces inside propel it at incredible speed.`
