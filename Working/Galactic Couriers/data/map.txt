While the atmospheric composition is almost identical to the human homeworld, the low pressure means that anyone outside of their ship or a space suit would quickly suffocate. But that still didn't stop many species of oxygen-producing microorganisms to form colonies in the few liquid water puddles.`

planet Bergimus
	landscape land/beach8-sfiera
	description `If it weren't for the lack of solid surface, Bergimus would be perfect for habitation. Because this moon orbits so close to a gas giant, the tidal forces were strong enough to break up and wash away most land. Islands made of piled up rocks sometimes rise above the water, but they don't stay solid long enough for any land-based life to develop. But there is a presence of mainly algae in the water that supply the atmosphere with oxygen.`

	description `Matunus is the most Earth-like planet in this lonely star cluster. The star it orbits has properties very similar to Sol and the gas giant at the edge of the star system protects the inner planets from asteroids. The main difference between Matunus and Earth is that there are no seasons here. The temperatures and climates are constant throughout the year and only differ by their distance from the equator.`

The star it orbits is relatively weak, so the majority of the planet is covered in permanent ice, with only a few saltwater rivers and ponds present near the equator. The size and relatively fast rotation of the planet results in extremely strong winds which often spark immensely powerful thunderstorms.`

	landscape land/space4
	description `This former Korath station was taken over by independent human pilots and now serves as the main hub of the Couriers. A lot of work had to be done to modify the station so that it would support prolonged human habitation.`
	description `	Thanks to the strong light and solar wind radiated from the triple star cluster at the center of this system, the huge energy needs of the station can easily be covered by solar power. The station also has integrated ramscoops to generate immense amounts of hyperspace fuel to support the Couriers' long travels.`
	spaceport `The Couriers modified the Korath docking bays so that they would be fully compatible with human ships. You notice an absence of any fuel tanks, presumably because the nearby stars are such a plentiful source that there's no need for storage. Some of the old Korath service bays have been converted into bars and shops, but many of the signs around here are written in non-human languages, presumably because the Couriers often receive various alien visitors.`
