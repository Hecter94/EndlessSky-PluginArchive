	description "A mysterious device recovered from the wreckage of an unknown alien vessel. Its original purpose was likely to function as the alien version of a hyperdrive, but it doesn't seem to be fully compatible with the hyperspace links of the Milky Way galaxy. But when paired with an actual hyperdrive, this device provides a slight jump performance boost."
