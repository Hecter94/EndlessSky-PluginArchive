Even though most of its outer hull survived, almost all systems inside were damaged beyond repair. Now that there are no longer three stars in the close vicinity, the station's solar-dependent power grid is starving and can only barely run the life support systems and outer shields.`

		spaceport `The spaceport has recently been moved closer to the north pole of the planet, partly to allow for construction of power plants with higher cooling requirements, and partly because the northern taigas of Matunus are one of only few places where large stretches of relatively level terrain can be found. The previous spaceport town has outgrown the valley it was established in, and the mountaneous terrain prevented it from expanding futher.`
		spaceport `Now that building materials and workers are abundant, the living standards of the local inhabitants are comparable to most human worlds in the Republic space.`

	planet Niamh
		add description `Once the Couriers settled in, Niamh became the primary mining world and source of raw materials. While its resource density and output is hardly comparable to the planets and moons in the Republic space, it provides enough materials for construction of small towns on other Courier outposts. The pressurized mineshafts are also rich in iron, silver, and gold, the primary materials required to assemble most electronics.`
		add spaceport `Given that the only traffic here are freighters and worker transports, no effort has been put into the spaceport's aesthetic. The landing pads are just flattened areas of dirt marked with a painted outline, and the ships have to be refueled from a fuel truck due to the lack of any fuel pumps. The spaceport 'town' consists of only a few pressurized buildings and has to be navigated in a space suit. The thin atmosphere also sometimes results in unbearable temperatures and scorching sunlight, therefore many local workers prefer to be in the mines throughout their entire working stay.`

	planet Bergimus
		add description `Bergimus is now home to desalination platforms. Out of all planets around, this one has the lowest salt concentration in its oceans so it is more efficient to produce drinking water here and transport it away. The warm oceans also make Bergimus a vacation destination, with the great view of its parent gas giant adding to the attractiveness.`
		add spaceport `The spaceport is a small facility stationed on one of the few solid islands near the planet's equator. The spaceport town is divided into two primary areas; one serves the idustrial purpose and is full of water storage tanks and purifiers, while the other is a pleasant village filled with shops and hotels to support the local tourism.`
		
	planet Boann
		add description `While the mineral composition of the water makes it difficult to purify it, the Couriers still deployed many floating platforms on the ocean surface. The main appeal is how easy it is to grow kelp, which can then be processed directly into food products or used as a fertilizer for 'dry' farms.`
		add spaceport `The spaceport is positioned on a rectangular artificial island near the equator. All human presence here is mostly scientific or work-related, so there aren't many shops or other leisure facilities to be found. At the heart of the spaceport town is a Courier laboratory, similar to the one on Matunus except almost completely dedicated to bio research and enhancements of kelp farming, which is the backbone of the entire Courier food production chain throughout the star cluster.`
		
	planet Taliesin
		landscape land/taliesin
		add description `After the Couriers settled in, Taliesin became a factory world. The low temperature means that a lot of equipment that would otherwise require extensive cooling can simply be air-cooled here, and the strong winds and storms are harnessed by countless wind power plants.`
		add spaceport `The spaceport is in a small town near the equator. The different industrial complexes around the planet are far apart from each other, so the spaceport also serves as a hub for a maglev train network that connects them all together. The spaceport town is a wonder of engineering; it is positioned in a valley where there is an almost constant wind downdraft. On the edges of the valley, the Couriers built huge heat exhausts, so the downward air currents pick up the heat and spread it around the entire town, increasing the localized temperature to a more bearable level. The same wind currents are also used to run the power-hungry heaters through many wind turbines.`
		
	planet Dorminus
		landscape land/dorminus
		add description `Due to the climate's dependence on the atmospheric composition, the Couriers established a series of restrictions when it comes to infrastructure here. All facilities with any form of pollutant emissions are prohibited from operating, and burner heaters can only be fueled by low-carbon substances like natural gas. If it weren't for the restrictions, Dorminus would likely become the central Courier hub, but right now it is a desired world for purely residential towns.`
		add spaceport `The landing pads are on floating platforms on the sea, so that arriving and departing ships wouldn't lift dirt particles into the atmosphere. While there is some infrastructure on the platforms, to get to the actual spaceport town one has to take a boat ride. The town itself is pleasant; it's weaved into the planet's forests and has a calming rural look. There is also a train station present with old-school 1.44 meter gauge tracks with catenary, something rare now that spaceships and maglevs are the standard, but the Couriers decided that using spaceships or building maglev paths would be too intrusive to the planet's climate.`
		
	planet Matunus
		add description `Now that the Couriers are fully settled in, Matunus serves as their 'homeworld'. The Courier Oversight - which basically serves as their main governing body - also has its headquarters here.`
