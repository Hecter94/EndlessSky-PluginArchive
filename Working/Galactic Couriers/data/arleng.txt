	description "This device seems to function as an exact opposite of the Ar'leng weapons; its power conductors are set up in reverse. This simple variation allows it to pull in heat from all of the subsystems of a ship its mounted in and push it through the very fabric of spacetime, practically making it disappear."
	description "When activated without any nearby heat sources, the heatsink can reach temperatures so close to the absolute zero that its own molecular bonds start falling apart."
