			`As you are walking through the spaceport, you notice a large merchant freighter, one of the big Syndicate designs, flying overhead. It is visibly damaged, with one of the engines spewing flames, and smoke coming out of the many holes in its hull.`
			`	Such a scene isn't uncommon in these parts of the galaxy. After all, freighters like this very often become targets of pirates. What catches your attention, however, is one of the holes near the freighter's engine compartment. There is a strong purple glow coming out, not too different from what your own jump drive produces. The freighter makes a sharp turn and lands not far from your ship.`

After a relatively short time, you spot the same freighter taking off again, with most of its damage frantically patched up. Just as it reaches an altitude high enough to start drawing a condensation trail in the sky, it suddenly and violently explodes. People around you start running for cover, but the explosion was so energetic that there is almost no visible debris left.`
			`	A few seconds after the explosion, a powerful shockwave arrives and shakes the ground, and a few more seconds after that you notice a faint rain of unburnt hyperspace fuel coming down. Perhaps it's for the better that you decided to leave the ship alone...`

Once you find it, you notice a group of people unloading containers with strange markings from it, and they all seem to be in a rush.

There are a few more people inside the ship working on repairs of the hull damage. Out of nowhere, one of them comes up behind you. You expect him to tell you to get out of there, but instead he just greets you and continues on his way. You soon realize that these are just the local spaceport workers, and they probably think you're a member of the ship's crew.`
			`	Given that the ship's actual crew is busy unloading the cargo, and the workers don't pose a threat to you, you could possibly go deeper inside the ship, but you're starting to doubt if it is a good idea.`

Inside the engine compartment you find out that the ship is indeed equipped with a jump drive, but it too seems to have suffered extensive damage.`
			`	Suddenly, the whole ship starts to shake as if it was preparing to take off. You rush towards the door, but for some reason it engaged emergency lockdown mode. You hear the engines starting and the entire room begins to heat up. The holes in the walls were patched using scrap pieces of metal, but the reparimen did a terrible job and you still manage to peek through one of them and look outside the ship.`
			`	In your view is the landing pad where the original crew stayed behind. The ship starts accelerating and gaining altitude. You begin to panic, you won't be able to survive in this leaky room if the ship enters the vacuum of space.`
			`	You try your hardest to open the door, but the dropping oxygen levels make it too difficult for you to concentrate. A strong purple glow starts filling the room, first you think that you're just losing your mind, but when you turn around, you notice the jump drive is overloading.`
			`	Out of exhaustion you sit down on the floor with your now blurry vision focused on the jump drive. Mere seconds later, the drive succumbs to the energy buildup and detonates.`

Can't tell you much about him, and I also don't have the security clearance to know what the cargo is. All I can tell you is that ships like this come here very often. I'm always assigned to supervising duty to make sure all the cargo is safely unloaded. Some people around here say that these ships come from some sort of an alien world, far from the human space, at the very north of the galaxy..."`
			`	"And you believe this?" you ask.`
			`	"Honestly, it wouldn't be that crazy" he responds, "once I tried following one of these freighters as it was jumping to a different system, but when I arrived, it was nowhere to be seen. We also almost never get to see the crew, but today is different. Actually, we should move away from this ship now, they're going to blow it up."`

			`	You chat for a few more minutes, after which Stefan tells you that he has to go. "Oh, one more thing, captain" he adds, "everything I just told you is top-secret. I know you can be trusted, though" he laughs.`
			`	You walk away from the landing pad to a nearby bar in the spaceport town, wondering if what Stefan told you is true. With a drink in your hand you watch the freighter take off on autopilot and fly far from the active airspace. Once it gets above the cloud layer, it detonates in an explosion so powerful that there's almost no debris left to fall back down.`
			`	Panic envelops the spaceport, there are people running all around you trying to find out what happened. You just sit there, sipping on your drink, thinking whether or not you should try looking for this system "in the north"...`

A couple dudes who supposedly stole some alien tech but were chased into hiding by some other dudes who wanted the tech for themselves. I once ran into one of the Courier captains in the spaceport, I expressed to him my concerns about a possible civil war breaking out, and he offered me to live here and work for them. Of course I agreed, this part of space is calm, there are no pirates here, and no threat of an interstellar conflict breaking out.

You may have heard of my company, the 'Galactic Couriers'..."`
			`	He crosses his hands and laughs, "...what a stupid name. But, nontheless, it was a huge success. While most independent merchants transport goods or people from one place to another, we managed to coordinate our operations. We built a network of freight routes that allowed us to transport cargo with a much higher efficiency, regardless of its source or destination; instead of one fleet of ships doing all the work, we set up transfer points where smaller freighters could load their cargo into large ones and in the process decrease the overall operating costs that come with flying small ships long distances."`

The precise flight schedules that allowed us to maximize efficiency also meant that our freight fleets were easily predictable, a single leaked document would allow pirates to set up a perfectly timed ambush. Each raid delivered three very damaging blows to the company, we lost good people, making it harder to employ new crew, we lost ships, many of which were leased, worsening our credit rating, and we also lost the cargo, giving our customers more reasons to doubt the safety and reliability of our services."`

Our employees and their family members started receiving threats, that if they keep working for us bad things would start happening to them. We don't know who sent those threats, I suppose not any of the pirates, because they wouldn't gain anything from our company going out of business. We tried to get the authorities involved, but they mysteriously couldn't find any clues. Anyone who did that must've had very good connections in the right places, they probably overheard that some of our ships were equipped with alien technology and wanted a piece of the action for themselves."`

We knew that the Syndicate and some free captains managed to snatch some from alien raids in the east, but we made ourselves an exceptionally large target by outfiting many of our ships with the drives. They were perfect for jumping between systems without links, it allowed us to confuse the pirate raiding parties and it also made many of our routes shorter. Of course, we didn't want to raise much attention when using them; we entrusted only our highest ranking pilots with them, and we made sure to use them only in empty systems or far away from any other traffic. We equipped our ships with the highest-grade interference plating in an attempt to hide the jump drives from Navy scanners, but we were bound to attract some attention."`

			`	You attempt to answer, but even before you start he interrupts you, "trick question. We didn't. We got only a handful from disabled Korath ships, but when the time came to relocate, we had to swap them between our fleets as they were going in and out of this star system. A fleet with jump drives would travel here, then the drives were all loaded onto a single freighter, sent back, installed on more ships, and the process could repeat."`

Anyway, I don't want to waste your time. Now that you've proven your worth, you will be granted access to better contracts.

We think that it used to be linked with the rest of the Korath space in the past, otherwise there would be no way for Korath drones to get here and set up the station in the first place, but we have no idea how the hyperspace links were severed. Another big mystery is why wasn't this system inhabited by the other Korath that have access to jump drives; a stable triple star system is extremely rare and has an immense energy output. Our standing theory is that the Korath still think that this system is inhabited by their drones. We also suspect that the planet this station is orbiting has extremely rich deposits of rare metals, but any attempts at setting up mining operations were hindered by the extreme atmospheric pressure and temperature."`

Oh, and since you made contact with them, we've also ran a few shipments for the Remnants. As far as the actual content of our shipment goes, I have no idea. When someone orders our services, we send a cargo inspector ahead of the actual freighter. He or she makes sure that the cargo is safe and legal, and if it is, it gets sealed in special containers designed to interfere with cargo scanners and then loaded onto the freighter. In the entire process, only the customer and the inspector know what the actual contents are. This way there's almost no possibility for information leak and thus the risk of raids and ambushes is minimized. Our customers also welcome the privacy. The inspectors are highly-trained professionals, many of them are ex-Navy officers, so the information is perfectly safe with them. Anything else?"`

I will think about it, but I don't believe those two would be a good choice."`

			`Once again you take the elevator to Novak's office, but when the door opens you see that the lounge in front of the office has been converted into a makeshift briefing room. There are computer screens on almost every wall and a table with a map of nearby star systems now takes up a majority of the room. You find Novak and about a dozen other people in the lounge discussing something, but your presence interrupts them.`
			`	"Capain <last>! Nice to see you again." says Novak.`
			choice
				`	"What's with the Korath ships in the system?"`
			
			`"Oh, those," he says, "we had a few more raids while you were gone. The Korath keep sending single ships to attack us, and we managed to capture three of them. I think their plan was to keep us busy with minor attacks while they hoard a huge fleet. Needless to say, their has plan failed."`
			`	He then gestures you to come look at something on the map. You notice that several uninhabited star systems around Meliter have been highlighted.`
			`	"This is where the Korath are building fleets," says one of the men accompanying Novak, "we've positioned our newly acquired Starlings in all of them, to monitor their activity. We've noticed that small fleets of two or three Raiders often jump in and then land near the poles of the local uninhabited planets. We don't want to risk bringing the Starlings any closer, they depend on solar winds to actively replenish their cloak, but just by counting how many Raiders landed and how many took off, we're pretty sure that there are at least a few dozen or so in each system."`

			choice
				`	"Why didn't you tell me sooner? I can help you."`
			
			`"Precautions" says Novak. He then nods at one of the other men in the room, a scientist, who starts explaining.`
			`	"As you know, our cargo dispatch can communicate with you anywhere in the galaxy, regardless of the hyperspace links. That is possible only thanks to salvaged Kor Sestor technology. Their automata are connected with a control center using a network that sends information almost instanteniously practically anywhere in the Milky Way. We're not sure if the Sestor developed it themselves or if it was created by their Korath ancestors, so we don't want to risk sending out messages that can be intercepted by the enemy."`
			`	"Chris is right" Novak continues, "in fact, we were planning to send a messenger for you in just a few hours. The fact that you came here right on time simplifies the situation."`
			`	Novak then turns his attention back the the group of pilots that he was talking to before you arrived, "Alright, so here's the plan. The Korath don't know that we're aware of their presence. As a result, they don't expect us to be prepared for their attack. I've secured a deal with one of our longtime customers in the Hai space. There's a group of Hai battleships equipped with jump drives parked in one of their uninhabited systems. They are manned entirely by our people. We need to get them here safely ASAP. Captain <last>, are you up for the task? It's just a quick and simple escort mission."`

Chris then zooms the view in on Meliter and you see that there is a link between it and Silikatakfar, a nearby star system.`

			`Your question seems to be completely ignored by Chris who instead keeps scrolling the screen until he finds a big block of text written in a language you don't understand.`
			`	"This is a variation of the Korath language" he says, "one that - due to its age - we have a very limited understanding of, but from what we've managed to translate, the Sestor drones were, and I quote, 'scared' of the 'entity' that appeared here. Obivously, machines like them can't feel fear the way living beings do, but even they would rather bail from a fight than stay and get destroyed."`
			`	He then scrolls the text a bit more, and continues.`
			`	"Some of the drones supposedly managed to escape using their hyperdrive, but for some reason many of them got stranded here when the link was severed. Instead, they used their engines to reach escape velocity, put their systems in a state of deep hibernation, and simply drifted away, towards the rest of the Sestor space. It probably took them hundreds of years, but that's not the point-"`

			`"Not much, I'm afraid" he answers, "the specifics about the weapon were exactly what was lost in the data corruption. We know for a fact that they built it and fired it at least once, and I have reasons to believe that this weapon is what severed the link and what 'summoned' this 'entity' that the Sestor mention."`

			`"Actually, yes. We have data logs from the day the weapon was fired. Once again, most of them are corrupted, but from the few good bits we managed to piece together some story. There was a massive energy buildup in the solar collectors of the station. Probably a solar flare. The Sestor likely used this opportunity of high energy output to power up the weapon, maybe to test it, maybe to use it against the Mereti. The data logs show an immense power surge followed by a large object suddenly appearing in this system. If I had to guess, I'd say it was a ship that was attracted by the unusual activity and jumped in. What or whose ship? No idea."`

I will need you to fly me through a few star systems where it will be able to collect sample data. After that's done, we can bring it back here and hopefully it will be able to detect if the 'entity' the Sestor drones were so worried about is still present in the proximity of Meliter."`

			`	"There was a supernova event in Persitar recently. There we'll be able to sample the star dust and also its effects on the local gravitational fields. The same applies for Fasitopfar, except there are much denser asteroid fields that'll help me visualise the said effects. Sagittarius A contains a black hole; I mainly want to see how the detector will handle the strong gravity and tidal forces. And our scouts discovered a wormhole in Coluber, I want to take some reading and compare them with the old Meliter logs, perhaps the alien entity came here using a similar effect."`
			choice
				`	"Why is gravity so important in the search for this alien ship?"`
			
			`"We know that the Sestor weapon somehow interfered with the hypespace links, and we also know that hyperspace links are closely tied to gravitational fields. Another thing is that this alien warped into the sector using some very unconvetional means - not a hyperdrive and not a jump drive. Instead, it seemed to emerge directly from the fabric of space itself, a principle similar to hyperspace travel but immensely more powerful. I'm confident that such an energetic event left an imprint in the gravitational fields in Meliter that this device will be able to detect."`

			`"When we first started working on the station" Chris says, "I noticed many peculiar things about its design. Every time a solar flare hit, we detected massive energy buildups in the power grid, the hull of the station acts as a superconductor and channels the solar energy into its systems. The Sestor wanted to use the station to tap into the power output of all three stars at once and then push it through a temporary and unstable hyperspace link into the Mereti territory. But when they first tested the weapon, something went wrong. The weapon misfired and somehow created a link between Meliter and some other system. The energy stream must've been amplified, it probably intersected a supernova or a black hole, because according to the logs it managed to link with a star about a hundred billion lightyears away. That's beyond the edge of the observable universe."`
			choice
				`	"Let me guess, the alien ship came from that system?"`
				
			`"Precisely" he says, "except I think it didn't 'come' here. These aliens developed their own form of interstellar travel that is vaguely similar to our hyperdrives, except much more powerful. The hyperspace stream created by Meliter must have interferred with that ship's own drive and forcefully pulled it here. That explains why the ship is still here, because its drive isn't exactly compatible with the hyperpsace links in the Milky Way, it got stranded. After the ship destroyed all Kor Sestor in Meliter, it likely entered a state of deep hybernation and only woke up after it detected the energy bursts created by out recent fights with the Korath."`

			`"We can't operate the weapon at full capacity" Chris says, "therefore we can't simply shoot the alien ship. But we think we may be able to use the station to redirect the power of the two large stars in Meliter's center to destabilize the smaller star that orbits them. Once the small star goes supernova, a chain reaction will follow that will also detonate the remaining stars and destroy the ship in the process. The explosion will be so powerful that even if the ship now turned around and started fleeing at full thrust, it would not be able to escape it."`

We hope that by placing them outside of the station's hull, we will be able to boost the shields to the point where the station will survive. They will use the power of the supernova itself, so their strenght should passively adapt to the force of the blast. My people are installing them as we speak."`
