			`To your surprise, the station seems to have taken the supernova pretty well. The automatic docking system is still working flawlessly, and the life support and artifical gravity systems also seem to be operational. One thing you notice is that the station is extremely cold now that it's no longer receiving heat from three stars simultaneously.`
			`	All hallways and rooms are almost completely empty, during the evacuation the Couriers took with them pretty much anything that wasn't bolted to the ground. You can hear multiple echoes of each of your steps as you make your way towards the main atrium where you meet Novak, Chris, and a few other Courier pilots sitting around a large table - which you assume is the last piece of furniture left on the station - with drinks and military food rations on it.`
			`	Both Novak and Chris are visibly delighted to see you, and Novak invites you to join them.`
			`	"Came to join our little picnic, captain?" laughs Novak.`
			choice
				`	"Chris, are you alright?"`
			`Chris laughs and says "Alright? I've never been better, <last>! Seeing a triple supernova first-hand, right outside of these windows... I did my best to keep many external sensors on the station running and I managed to collect more data on these events than most Republic research efforts combined! In fact, most of the cameras on the outside stayed functional throughout the entire event, look..."`
			`	He then pulls out his tablet and scrolls through a directory full of short video clips from the different docking cameras of the station.`
			`	The first one shows the alien ship in detail as it engaged with the Korath, seconds after the last Courier fleet left the system. The ship is seen unleashing a rain of fast and deadly projectiles, destroying all the Korath battleships before they even have a chance to retaliate. At one point it drifts out of the camera's view, so Chris switches to another clip. When the last Korath ship explodes, the alien vessel turns its attention towards the station. It starts firing, but the first supernova goes off and sweeps the projectiles before they can reach the station. The vessel stops, its engines probably got knocked out in the blast wave, but the two additional stellar explosions manage to tear it apart, leaving almost no wreckage behind.`
			`	"The same happened to the planet the station was orbiting" says Chris, "the first explosion completely blown away its atmosphere and the two subsequent blasts just obliterated it."`
			choice
				`	"So both the weapon and the shields worked?"`
			`"The shields performed phenomenally" he says, "in fact, during the peak of the blasts they pulled in so much energy that I was afraid it may overload the weapon and trigger another detonation, this time inside the station. I was forced to activate it again to bleed the energy off, I targeted an empty spot in space and just let it channel the power there. Sadly, there wasn't much I could do to limit the current, the weapon and all of its control circuitry got completely fried."`
			`	"Maybe it's for the better" says Novak, "I'll sure be sleeping well, knowing that the thing that can pop stars with the press of a button is out of commission."`
			`	"Right," says Chris, "now that both the weapon and the triple star system are gone, there is no reason for the Korath to come here. Meliter just became another subpar Kor Sestor station."`
			choice
				`	"So the Couriers are over?"`
			`"Honestly," says Novak, "I have no idea. Many of the people that lived on the station just went back to living in the Republic. Can't blame them, after all, I promised them a calm and stable place to call home. And, at least in my opinion, three stars going nuclear is as far from 'calm' and 'stable' as you can get. But then there's the other group of people. They enjoyed the freedom that living in an isolated system far from human civilization gave them... some of them even enjoyed the thrill of piloting ships through alien territories and fighting the Korath. We are no longer a company, we're a community, and if we can find another place to call 'our own' then I'm all in for re-settling."`
			` 	You then chat for a little longer, but are often interrupted by power outages.`
			`	"The station is trying its hardest to keep the shields powered" says Chris, "I think we should go before the life support collapses."`
			`	While the Courier pilots are busy packing up anything left behind the evacuation, you say goodbye to Chris and Novak and prepare to head your own way, but not before Chris invites you to meet him in the research center on Earth once you have some free time.`

			`Once again you make your way to McKay's research center. You find him and Chris inspecting the two identical devices that you brought from Meliter.`
			`	"This is incredible!" says McKay, "This device... it must've been the alien ship's variant of a hyperdrive!"`
			`	"Indeed" says Chris, "the radiated energy signature is very similar to our own hyperdrives. Except much more... refined."`
			choice
				`	"What's so incredible about that? Everyone in the Milky Way has hyperdrives."`

			`	"Sadly, we're missing the crucial pieces" says McKay, "it is very possible that these devices were only one part of the ship's hyperdrive system. By themselves they don't seem to be able to function as drives. But we think that we can interface them with our own hyperdrives and jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"And what would that do?"`
				
			`"On the surface," continues McKay, "not much. I think we could use these 'augmenters' - as I like to call them - to increase the performance of our current drives, allowing a ship with one of these installed to engage hyperspace jumps without having to bleed off all of its velocity. But that is not the main part..."`
			`	"We also think we can use this to traverse the wormhole that was formed in Meliter" says Chris, "and not only that, we can make the device resonate at any frequency we want, at the quantum level, so a ship equipped with one of these could also travel through the wormholes in the Ember Wastes region without the need of a keystone."`

At one point, Meliter was home to over fifty thousand refugees from planets that couldn't properly defend themselves.

			`	You don't know where Chris is, so you ask around and find out that he is in the 'blast room', two levels underground. You take the elevator down and find chris in a hazmat suit inside a small chamber lined with explosion-proof glass and metal. In the middle of the chamber is a small metal cylinder with white smoke pouring out of it. Chris uses a pair of large pliers to reach inside the cylinder and pulls out a strange purple object. At first, you can't quite see what it is, but as the smoke clears out you recognize that it is a keystone, not different from the one you yourself used to traverse the wormholes in the Ember Wastes.`

			`	Chris nods, and continues. "But right now there is a much more pressing matter on hand. Santa Maria - our World-Ship - has recently been encountering a lot of raids and ambushes, both pirate and Korath. The ship itself is pretty strong and durable, but sooner or later we want to have regular cargo ships travelling between the Courier and Republic space.

			`	Slightly nervous, you look around the landing pads but don't see anything that would resemble the Corsair recruiting site. You're not really sure where to go, so you seek out the least disturbing-looking pirate around you to ask him.`
			choice
				`	"Hey, do you know anything about the Corsairs?"`
					goto question
				`	"Ahoy matey! I heard that th' Corsairs are crimpin' 'n I would like t' join thar ranks."`

			`"What the hell are you talking about?" he says, confused.`
			`	"The Corsairs... do you know about them?" you say.`			
					
			label question
			`"You interested in joinin' them?" he asks. "Don't even bother, those guys only take the best of the best. I tried and they rejected me on the spot."`
			choice
				`	"Who said I'm not the 'best of the best'?"`
			
			`"Well you're just as overconfident as they are" he laughs. "One of them is now in the nearby pub. If he thinks you're Corsair material, he'll take you to their ship for questioning."`
			`	The man then goes on to show you the direction to the pub and you get on your way. Once inside, you instantly notice the Corsair pilot. He's wearing a bright red uniform lined with shiny gold ornaments all over it.`
			`	"Oh no, another one of you?" he says when he sees you, "listen, kid, I'll tell you what I already told everyone else on this planet; we're not hiring."`
			choice
				`	"What do I need to do for you to reconsider?"`
						
			`"For me... to reconsider?" he repeats. "Alright, you look like you have at least some bit of decency, which means a lot in this hellhole, so I'll give you a chance."`
			`	He gestures for you to follow him and takes you to his Hai battleship. You sit down in one of the ship's bunks and the Corsair starts questioning you.`
			`	"Alright, kid," he says, "if you want to be one of us, you need to prove that you have enough experience in the field. So, what is your background? Where do you come from?"`
			choice
				`	"I was with the Syndicate, but then I stole their jump drives and went on to make a fortune smuggling alien technology."`
			
			`"Alright," he says, visibly impressed, "that's what we like to hear. Tell me, what do you know about the Korath and their drones?"`
			`	You explain to him that you know almost everything and that you're capable of capturing their ships. The Corsair listens with amazement, obviously they must be very desparate to acquire those ships otherwise he'd me much more suspicous.`
			`	"So far the Hai ships were the backbone of our fleet" he says. "But when we discovared that there's an untapped source of even more powerful ships with weapons unchallenged by anything in the human space... too bad those damn birds screwed it up."`
			`	He looks around the bunk, almost as if to make sure that no one else is listening in on your conversation, and continues.`
			`	"I don't have the authority to outright accept you to our group. But I'll give you a tip; if you manage to cap some of those ships, bring them to Deadman's Cove. Our Fleet Admiral lives there."`
			choice
				`	"Thank you, I'll do that."`
			`You leave the Corsair ship, wondering if what he told you was true. But that is for the Couriers to decide, now you have to safely return back to Taliesin.`
