Attempts to adjust mass values for ships in the game Endless Sky. Where mass governs acceleration and turning and drag limits max velocity, larger ships should have more mass so they accelerate slower than small ships... 

Work in progress...

Summary of changes from 9.13:

Adjusts mass stat of ships based on the stats of the ship. I.E. Shield hitpoints,
hull hp, outfit space, etc.

Most ships gain mass small ships gain a little, large ships gain a lot. See spreadsheets/ShipMassStats
for details.

Large ships are much slower to turn and accelerate, making them feel like large ships.

Shield recharge and hull repair systems have been given a 90% boost to capablilty to help the slower
ships survive combat longer.

Added an efficiency penalty to energy consumption. spreadsheets/shieldSystems for details.
	
For example:

Human rechargers are 85% efficient, resulting in an 18.4% increase in power consumption over 
shield recharge. Vanilla is 1 point of energy gets you 1 point of shields.

Ship engines are reworked to increase the smaller engines while keeping the larger ones close to the same.

Smaller ships are now faster compared to the max speeds of the largest ships. spreadsheets/Engines.

Human/Hai engines' prices have been increased: Ion +20%, Plasma +30%, Atomic +80%. The lore speaks of
how expenisive atomic engines are, but they don't feel like it... Hopefully Ion and plasma engine fits
are more attractive to the early game.
