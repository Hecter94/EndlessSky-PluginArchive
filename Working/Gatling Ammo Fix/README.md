# Gatling Ammo Fix

This plugin fixes availability of Gatling Gun Ammo (and its boxes) - being most primitive and easiest to manufacture type of ordnance, it is now available where you would expect it to be (hint: "galactic south" and multipurpose ammo depots).

## Installing


Check:
https://github.com/Cat-Lady/Gatling-Ammo-Fix/releases

...for latest, pre-packaged version.

Unpack to your ES plugins folder. Be sure that you have single ``gatling-ammo-fix`` directory inside your plugins folder, containing ``data`` folder. Directory structure should look like:

```(...)/plugins/gatling-ammo-fix/(.../data/, and other stuff)```


It **won't** work if the directory structure will be anything like:

```(...)/plugins/Gatling-Ammo-Fix/gatling-ammo-fix/(...)```
