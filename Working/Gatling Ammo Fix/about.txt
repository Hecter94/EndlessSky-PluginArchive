This plugin fixes availability of Gatling Gun Ammo (and its boxes) - being most primitive and easiest to manufacture type of ordnance, it is now available where you would expect it to be (hint: "galactic south" and multipurpose ammo depots).

Recommended to use with Becca's Endless Expansion plugin (which adds Kraz Cybernetic's Accurate Gatling Blaster" variant).
