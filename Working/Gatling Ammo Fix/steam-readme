[h1]This plugin is a part of upcoming "Endless Sky: Captain's Edition" reboot of the base game. Stay tuned - meanwhile, installing the plugins can help to preview the experience, together or in parts.[/h1]

This plugin fixes availability of Gatling Gun Ammo (and its boxes) - being most primitive and easiest to manufacture type of ordnance, it is now available where you would expect it to be (hint: "galactic south" and multipurpose ammo depots).


[h1]Installing[/h1]
