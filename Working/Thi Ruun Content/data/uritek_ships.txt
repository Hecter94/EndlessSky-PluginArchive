	description "Though the Thi-Ruun forbid themselves from altering the designs from the time of the Kiel-Ruun, there is nothing stopping aspiring Thi-Ruun ship designers from using ancient designs as inspiration for newer ones. The Uritek-Ceqai thus came about; a heavier implementation of the original Uratal Kelai. Though it carries no missile defense of its own, the Uritek-Ceqai has an extremely powerful frontal armament, meaning it can rapidly shred ships even many times its size."
