# Axle Engines
# These act as omnidirectional engines, but are limited to ships with the "primary axle" attribute.

	description `Kiel-Ruun ships are designed with a main "axle" that allows them to redirect their engine's thrust towards the rear, front, or sides, affording Kiel-Ruun ships surprising mobility despite their weight. These large chambers are the workhorses of such a system, providing substantial mobility at the cost of being quite large and being unable to provide engine power without a main axle to direct their energy into.`


# Thrusters
# Power is extremely high for the engine space they use, but balanced by a higher mass/outfit cost.

	description "Whereas most other races use large dedicated engine blocks, the Thi'Ruun instead use central management blocks in conjunction with dozens or hundreds of small propulsors located around the ship. This lightens the load on the engine block, but requires more general outfit space for all the extra infrastructure."
