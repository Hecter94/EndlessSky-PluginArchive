	description "The Whirlwind Battery has been in service with the Thi'Ruun for thousands of years, but the Sakaar'Ruun seldom shy away from applying experimental upgrades to long-proven technology. The Tempest Battery improves on the Whirlwind in terms of range, durability, and punch, but is a bit more costly than the civilian option, and has poorer sustained fire capability."
	description "Like the Whirlwind, the Tempest Battery provides a significant amount of recoil upon firing, allowing a ship to keep its distance from the fray."

	description "Gravity Torpedoes are an odd projectile, firing straight until they get close enough to their target, at which point they activate a gravitational tether between them and their desired target, rapidly course-correcting and crashing into the target. Though each launcher fires slowly, several gravity torpedoes acquiring locks in quick succession can be a death sentence for most ships. It's been very explicitly stated that these powerful munitions provoked the development of the Kelaar'Ruun's Eraser Torpedoes."
