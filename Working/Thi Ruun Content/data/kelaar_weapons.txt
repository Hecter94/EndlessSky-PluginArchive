	description "This is a small mine launcher that allows for deployment of Shatter Mines, used most commonly aboard the Kelaar'Ruun's Scale-class fighter. Though the nodes hold very little in the way of ammunition by themselves, they easily connect to storage tracks to allow for a continuous deployment of mines over an extended battle."

		"stream"
	description "Developed as part of the Kelaar'Ruun's less-lethal weaponry program, Suppressors are medium-ranged missiles that release electromagnetic pulses on impact, disrupting ship systems. Fired in a steady stream, with modest homing capability, Suppressors provide a consistent amount of damage over good range, but can suffer against high-level anti-missile systems due to their rather low durability."
	description "Because of their intended use as a consistent stream of damage, multiple Suppressor Launchers will fire in sequence, instead of all at once."
