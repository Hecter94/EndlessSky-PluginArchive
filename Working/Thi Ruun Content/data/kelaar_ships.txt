	description "The scale is one of the Kelaar'Ruun's chosen carry designs; though unorthodox, it fills its role as a mass-deployable minelayer quite well. With gun ports on the back of the ship, the Scale is able to lay a considerably large field of mines in short order, while remaining mobile."
	description "Though technically manned by a single Thi'Ruun drone, the ship is built around its pilot, meaning the pilot cannot be extracted from the ship to capture it."

	description "The Kelaar'Ruun, as a technical bureau, focus on defensive technologies. This ship is one of their premier offerings; though slow, it is exceptionally hardy for a light warship, and acts as a multi-purpose screening vessel and meat shield in Kelaar'Ruun fleets."
