	description "Being such a missile-focused faction, the Thi-Ruun have had ample time to develop a staggeringly set of missile countermeasures. This is the smaller of two light carry ships, designed to escort a larger ship through missile-infested system easily."

	description "The larger of the Thi-Ruun's dedicated anti-missile drones, this ship isn't quite as fast as its smaller cousin, but packs a far heavier armament to allow it to effectively weaken even the largest barrages."

	description `Though its name and design implies that it is created by Kalore-Illoca, this design was actually developed by committee, and is locally produced on many worlds. As a heavy cargo fighter, these ships are quite sluggish, but provide any fleet capable of carrying them a significant increase in cargo space.`
	description `As with all Thi-Ruun fighters, the ship is built around its pilot, making it virtually impossible to capture.`
