	description `The Kiel-Ruun died out long ago; before their home star was within the Milky Way's boundaries. However, the Thi-Ruun, being the ones who originally built the ships, still manufacture them as tribute to their creators; hence the name "Uratal", which directly translates to "Legacy" in the Thi-Ruun's native tongue.`
	description `Kiel-Ruun ships are quite lightly armed, with only simple panic defenses. However, they play host to large sorties of defensive fighter craft, meaning a Kiel-Ruun subject to attack will quickly be screened with defensive fighters.`

	description `Dating back to the time of the Kiel-Ruun, this ship is a remnant of a time when the Thi-Ruun were little more than soulless automaton servants. Built around a pair of Thi-Ruun drones as pilots, these ships are exceptionally durable, even by the Thi-Ruun's standards, however they suffer somewhat in the mobility department.`
