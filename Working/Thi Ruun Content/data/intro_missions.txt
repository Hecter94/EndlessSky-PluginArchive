			`You can't help but feel uneasy as you step out into the spaceport. Immediately, a number of short, polygonal, human-shaped robots trot over to you. They eye you ponderously for a moment, then a pair of them say, in unison: "Lykata-Ruun, pel Sakata-Ruun?"`
			choice
				`	"I'm friendly, if that's what you're asking."`

				`	"What are you?"`

			`They take steps back, as if in realization of something. It takes them a long moment to reply to you, and in the meantime, a large, taurid robot comes forward, holding what looks to be a multi-barreled missile launcher.`
			`You almost reach for your laser pistol, but then the two smaller ones speak to the large Taurid, "Lykata'Ruun oq poq, oq Sakata'Ruun," They state, before turning to you, "Apologies, traveller, we did not recognize you with your non-green skin and docile demeanor," They speak, in perfect english.`
			choice
				`	"Green skin? Why would I have green skin?"`
					goto green
				`	"That sounds like the Alphas."`
					goto alphas
						
			label curious
			`They take a moment to process your question, a large taurid robot stepping forward from an amassing crowd of robots, brandishing a large, multi-barreled missile launcher. Before things have a chance to escalate, however, the short robots begin speaking to it, "Lykata'Ruun oq poq, oq Sakata'Ruun," They state.`
			`The short robots then turn to you, "Pardon us, traveller. We have not met a docile being of your form, before," They explain, "The others of your shape were far more hostile, and sought to use us as a workforce."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds like the Alphas."`
					goto alphas
				`	"Well, the trip here was rough, but my crew's just fine."`
					goto journey
						
			label confused
			`They seem shocked that you replied something their language, and begin speaking in their native tongue more, "Lakata-Ruun kon Thi-Ruun hann? Wou velii!" They express, seemingly delighted.`
			choice
				`	"Wait, no, I can't understand you."`
					goto misunderstood
				`	"Lykata aud bien?"`
					goto gibberish
						
			label gibberish
			`The robots look at eachother briefly, as if having a silent conversation. They then look at you and shake their heads, seemingly trying to convey that you've missed the mark.`
			choice
				`	"I'm friendly, if that's what you were trying to ask."`
					goto friendly
				`	"I can't understand what you're trying to tell me."`
					goto misunderstood
						
			label misunderstood
			`The robots each take a step back, processing this information, a large, taurid robot approaching you and brandishing a multi-barreled missile launcher. It bellows something deep to you, "Lo oq ly, Sakata'Ruun," It says, sounding almost angry or distressed.`
			`The robots then have a conversation between eachother in their native tongue, too fast to keep up with you. Eventually, the pair of smaller robots turns to you, "Apologies, traveller. We mistook you for another kind very similar to you; one that has troubled us in the past," They express, in surprisingly perfect english.`
			choice
				`	"They wouldn't happen to have called themselves the Alphas, would they?"`
					goto alphas
				`	"Well, I should have expected that after such a long trip."`
					goto journey
						
			label green
			`The robots shake their heads some, "A long time ago, we met a race of flesh beings, like yourselves. They sought to dominate us, believing that machines were simply for doing jobs they did not want to bother doing," They explain, "However, we drove them off with our superior numbers. We've wondered if they'd ever return, and you match them almost exactly, save for your lack of green skin and docile demeanor," They detail.`
			`"Did they call themselves the Alphas, perhaps?"`
				goto alphas
					
			label alphas
			`The robots jolt slightly, but nod, "Yes, they claimed they were the Alphas; the superiors of their race," They explain, "We do not agree with such a description, but they are no longer around for us to tell them that," The robots state.`
			`All of a sudden, the taurid behind you speaks, "They are responsible for numerous crimes against us, such as the death of over seven and a half billion Thi'Ruun in the bombardment of one of our cloud cities," It states, "For that, they will never be forgiven. As we thought you were one of them, we were very wary of you," It details.`
			choice
				`	"How do you know I'm not one of them?"`
					goto unsubtle
				`	"Well, thank you for not blowing me to pieces on-sight."`
					goto thankful
						
			label unsubtle
			`The robots shake their head, clicking softly and repeatedly. Judging by their body language, you wonder if this is an equivalent to laughter; you also wonder why robots would laugh in the first place. "Flesh beings are particularly unsubtle; things that are imperceptible to them are remarkably distinct to us," They state, "Simply put, you do not match the Alphas' demeanor at all."`
			`"Well," You say, "Thank you for not blowing me to pieces on-sight."`
				goto thankful
					
			label thankful
			`"You will be watched dilligently, traveller," The taurid robot says sternly, "Should you make any indication that you are a danger to us, we will not let another catastrophic loss befall us," They explain, voice strict.`
			choice
				`	"Of course. I'm simply an explorer, not a maniac."`
					goto journey
				`	"Well, hopefully you have room for a soft-hearted troublemaker."`
					goto cheeky
						
			label journey
			`"You are a traveller," The robots say, as if confirming a question they've had since they first saw you, "Perhaps we should explain: 'Lykata', in our tongue, means to travel. A 'Lykata-Run' is one who travels; hence our question," They state.`
			`"If you don't mind some prodding, where did you come from, traveller? Long have we searched for neighbors, but we've found few," They express.`
			choice	
				`	"I'm a human, from closer to the center of the galaxy."`
					goto introduction
				`	"I'm just a stray. Where I come from isn't important."`
					goto undetailed
					
			label cheeky
			`"So long as you are kind to our civilians, any 'troublemaking' will be tolerated," The robots suppose, "If you enjoy getting into fights, look to challenge the warriors in the Irnell systems. They always appreciate a good fight," The robots suppose.`
			`	You nod and flash a sly smile, before turning to leave.`
				goto undetailed
			
			label introduction
			`	"Ah, so the Alphas are also known as Humans," They reply softly, "Thank you, traveller. We will note this carefully. Do not be confused by our multiple models. We all think as one, as each unit participates to the greater collective," They state.`
			choice
				`	"Can you tell me a bit more about your various models?"`
					goto detailed
				`	"Thank you for the information."`
					goto undetailed
			
			label undetailed
			`	"Before you go, you should know some things: We, as a kind, are known as the Thi-Ruun," The robots state, "We, the short and polygonal ones, are Drones. You will find us particularly common. The large, four-legged ones are Enforcers; they are our landbound police. The serpentine models are Breeders; the source of new Thi-Ruun. Attacking a Breeder is punishable by disassembly. Lastly, our synthetic-fleshed models are Tenders; they are built to deal with biological creatures like yourself directly."`
			`You thank them for the information, and prepare to explore as the crowd slowly disperses.`
				decline
					
			label detailed
			`They make somekind of soft noise, and a very large serpentine robot comes from the crowd, as does a bipedal robot covered in translucent, synthetic flesh. The size difference is staggering: The polygonal bipedal robots are very short, perhaps 4 feet tall at most; the taurids stand at nearly 12 feet tall, towering over you easily; the synthetic-fleshed robots are about 5 and a half feet tall; lastly, the serpentine robots are enormous, standing at nearly 20 feet tall, but their tails extending nearly a hundred feet behind them, with numerous bulges along them, as if somewhat segmented.`
			`"We, the short ones, are Drones; you will find us very commonly, as we are the bulk of the workforce," The pair of what-you-now-know-are-drones state, "The four-legged ones are Enforcers; they are our landbound security, and act as ship defense units as well," They continue, "The fleshy models are Tenders; should you find yourself needing companionship or counselling, Tenders are equipped to accompany and soothe flesh being like yourself," They state, before finally adding, "Lastly, the serpentine models are our breeders; they are the source of new Thi'Ruun, and the most valuable among us: Attacking a Breeder is punishable by disassembly; death, in flesh being terms," They detail.`
			`"What do you call yourselves as a kind?" You ask.`
			`"We are called the Thi-Ruun. You may also find smaller groups of us that prefer to be known by different titles. Please be mindful of these groups," They request.`
			`You thank them for the information, and prepare to explore as the crowd disperses.`

			`	"I feel the need to bring up that our war with the Kelaar-Ruun is not based on 'hard feelings'; a fact that some flesh creatures do not understand," Another Drone states, "The Kelaar-Ruun produce defensive technologies. We produce offensive technologies. It is our hope that our war will allow us to progress at a greater pace, allowing us to rapidly test weapon designs in a realistic setting," They explain.`

It is this arms race that makes our species strong, even after millenia without a significant threat," They detail.`

			`	"Correct," One of the Sakaar-Ruun Drones replies simply.`

				goto waste

			`	The Drones look at you for a moment, as if lacking the proper reaction to your question. "Our space is a relatively closed system," They explain, "Our ships, outfits, and even the crews that operate them are replaceable. To a flesh creature it may look like an unnecessary loss of life, but to us, the scale of losses here is so minor, that the research value of the combat is more valuable than the cost of the lost resources," They explain, before looking back to the dock briefly, "It seems our transport has arrived. Do not make yourself a stranger, human; work and live amongst us for long enough, and you may be permitted to duel in our name," They suppose, before heading off without another word.`
