	description "Kalore-Illoca is the premiere producer of freighters in Thi-Ruun space, operating mostly in the western regions. They specialize in industrial-scale, durable freighters for usage in large mining or construction operations, but see considerable usage in standard commerce as well. The Tuell-Kalore is their most popular ship, combining considerable durability and cargo space in a relatively affordable package."

	description "Though the majority of their produced ships are the Tuell-Kalore, the Sakaar-Malue-Kalore is Kalore-Illoca's self-proclaimed best design. A massive battlefreighter, capable of serving both commercial and combative roles; despite its purpose as a mining carrier or large-scale cargo ship, its weapon and fighter capacity rivals humanity's greatest warships."
	description "Notably, this is one of the newest-adopted ship models in Thi-Ruun space, dating back roughly 380 thousand years; though, of course, the design has been honed and improved since then."

	description "Kalore-Illoca mostly prioritizes freighter construction, but the popularity of the Sakaar-Malue-Kalore with Thi-Ruun Warfleets demanded a more combat-oriented design. The result was the Sarula-Mikai-Kalore: Somewhat of a hybrid between a heavy warship and a military support vessel, this ship lacks carrier bays of any sort and is far less at carrying cargo than its bigger brother, but is far faster and better-suited to combat."
