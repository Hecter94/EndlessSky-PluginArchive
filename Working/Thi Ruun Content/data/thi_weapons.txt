	description "This simple missile system has been in service with the Thi-Ruun for aeons as their standard-issue civilian missile launcher. Though nowadays more advanced variants exist, the reliability of this weapon system has proven a deciding factor in its continued service, even after tens of thousands of years without so much as a cosmetic alteration."

	description "This bulky installation is designed to fire large salvos of unguided Pollo-Guli missiles at distant attackers. Though the turret turns somewhat slowly due to the bulk needed to launch salvos of missiles so rapidly, it cannot match the stabilizing power of a ship's entire mass, thus reducing the platform's accuracy."

	description "Alkro-Jaqu missiles were designed to reliably disable a target's shields over long range, allowing shorter-ranged craft to finish the job. In addition to their primary damage, they cause additional discharge over time, causing incredible suppressive power to build as more missiles hit their target."

	description `Inghlo (literally, "Fuel Tank") Missiles double as a ship's ancillary fuel storage, but also pack an enormous punch should worst come to worst. Covered in fragmentation casing, these missiles contain a proximity trigger and simple homing systems that guide them within damaging range of a foe, before detonating, causing considerable damage to all around them. They are, however, quite large, and need to be full of fuel when firing.`
	description `To reduce the chance of exploding in the tube, Inghlo Missiles are launched by electromagnetic means rather than deflagrative means. The electromagnetic charge of the barrel also allows Inghlo Launchers to double as ramscoops, though their effectiveness within this task is questionable.`

	description "Yaktha Missiles are a Kiel-Ruun ship's only standard shipboard defense. Fired in great numbers as a swarm of projectiles, they are too small to be locked on by anti-missile systems, and thus it is best to put less valuable ships between them and a more valuable target."
