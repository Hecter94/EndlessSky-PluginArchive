	description "When Yurliakaeon first came onto the scene, the only fighters used in Thi-Ruun space were either for combat or point defense. Quickly, a cargo fighter was commissioned by committee, leading to the Uyiti-Kalore. However, Pollo-Talia realized that the flexibility of the carriers could be further improved by offering a cheap, lightweight fighter that could transport work crews. This compact, lightweight fighter is the result of their research."
	description "Even though the ship is intended to have Thi-Ruun occupants, it is still built around its pilot."

	description "For the longest time, the Tarlec-Pollo was the only interstellar transport in Thi-Ruun space. However, as interstellar commerce became more demanding, many Thi-Ruun were dissatisfied at only being able to transport 2 units at a time. Thus, the Polaq-Pollo came about as a method of remedying this issue; able to transport over a thousand individuals quickly and efficiently, this ship is considered by some Thi-Ruun to be the pinnacle of their engineering prowess."

	description `The Pollo-Talia (anglicized as "Old Rotation") Corporation is one of the oldest production companies in Thi-Ruun space, specializing in making well-designed transports for the common Thi-Ruun populous. The Tarlec-Pollo (or "Lesser Vortex") is their most popular ship; large enough to carry two standard units of Thi-Ruun individuals while still being cheap enough to be easily mass-producible. It dces require a larger crew than most human vessels, but is also reasonably well-armed in the event of a hostile encounter.`
