	description "The Thi-Ruun have had millenia to strengthen and diversify their shield technology, but the Reconstructor has been the backbone of their defensive ability for many of those aeons passed. Reconstructors recharge shields somewhat slowly, but rebuild the ship's shield in such a way that makes it more difficult to damage or pierce."

	description "The largest Thi-Ruun shield reconstructor is a behemoth of a shield generator, costing more than small ships but providing a nearly 50 percent increase to a ship's shield durability. The drawbacks are, of course, its enormous size, and the fact that it causes your shields to consume over twice the standard amount of energy."

	description "Relac-Viule's ships rely on strong hulls as opposed to shields, and thus they have invested significantly into hull reparation techniques. Hull Molds work like ancient naval plastic armor, but with the additional benefit of being able to be reconstituted on the go thanks to small dispensers embedded in the ship's hull."
	description "Because the plastic armor component must be melted and cooled to set properly, this is an exceptionally power- and cooling-hungry method of repairing hull."

	description "This tiny device is a hybrid shield and hull restoration device, designed by the Kelaar-Ruun to provide their smallest ships with a way to recover after a strenuous battle. It requires a constant feed of power to operate, but is capable of amazing things for such a small outfit."
