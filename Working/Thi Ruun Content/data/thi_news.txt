			"Lifeforms are very fragile. There are very few planets capable of holding life, and making such planets habitable is an immense undertaking."
			"Do you require assistance, human? We tenders are responsible for taking care of biological creatures, yourself included."
			"The verdant serpents of Nul-Poqor are some of our favourite company in space. Some Shipmasters outfit rooms with life support systems just for their pets."
			"Nul-Poqor's verdant snakes are quite sociable, but not particularly intelligent. Certainly not intelligent enough to achieve spaceflight on their own, at least."
			"I can't imagine that pressure suit is particularly comfortable. For that, we greatly appreciate your company."
			"Please, make yourself at home. Don't let the Enforcers make you feel discomfort; they're only doing their jobs."
			"We do not have much food to offer; biological beings cannot simply recharge from batteries, however, so supplying food to our nature preserving worlds is a challenge."
			"Some Tenders spend most of their working hours harvesting volatile flora from Vailor-Ough. I do not envy them."
			"All Thi-Ruun are designed to preform basic self-maintenance, so us Tenders are not as overworked as one may think. We are mostly in charge of intensive repairs, such as joint failures or power malfunctions."

			"Our ships are designed for the rigors of industry; should we ever be invaded again, their durability will aid in the protection of our space."
			"There is at least one Drone inside every ship, even if the ship appears otherwise unmanned. Drone integration is easier than designing all new software."
			"The war between the Kelaar-Ruun and Sakaar-Ruun has been going on for millenia. It seems wasteful, but is crucial to our technological development."
			"The war between the Kelaar-Ruun and Sakaar-Ruun has been going on for millenia. It's necessary to our development, but disrupts trade routes due to fear of collateral damage."
			"Kiel-Ruun ships lack much in the way of direct defense; they are instead reliant on escorts to protect them. We were created to pilot the defense ships."
			"The nature of our inequal intelligence between castes means our research projects go quite slowly, but our numbers mean we often have dozens operating at once."
			"The ships and outfits you see in our space are the results of millenia of testing, scrapping, developing, and updating designs."
			"Be sure to stop by our life-supporting worlds. They are some of our most-beloved."
			"Though we operate as one cohesive unit, individual Thi-Ruun source code grows and changes overtime. This results in design differences, such as the differences between Relac-Viule's and Kalore-Illoca's ships."
			"Though we operate as one cohesive unit, individual Thi-Ruun source code alters itself overtime. This results in design differences, such as the differences between Pollo-Talia's ships and Yurliakaeon's ships."
			"Every system's name describes its original tactical value to us. Some systems have vastly overexceeded their expected usefulness, others vastly underexceeded."
			"A Shipmaster is a Thi-Ruun in charge of a single ship, assigned to them by a Fleetmaster, and is permitted to adjust its outfits, weapons, or even its Fighters and Drones."
			"We have had to deal with horrible cyberattacks in the past. That's why our source code updates occasionally: it protects us from being wiped out by one single flaw."
			"The act of increasing a Breeder's size to permit them to produce Thi-Ruun at a greater frequency is a sacred ritual of ours. To us, Breeders are great creators; deities might be a comparable human term."

			"Your presence as an observer is tolerated. Involving yourself in conflict is ill-advised."
			"We do not use centralized security checkpoints; they are not necessary. If needed, we will search you ourselves."
			"Theft of ships or their components is a punishable offense. Excess or not, every component has its place."
			"A calm reminder to you that assaulting a Breeder, regardless of effect on target, is punishable by being deconstructed."
			"Move along, human. We have no qualm with you."
			"Make no mistake, human, we are on good terms. However, we must remain vigilant in the event that condition no longer holds true."
			"Our Patrol fleets are designed to keep potential attackers busy until a Warfleet can join the fight."
			"Attacking civilians will be swiftly and rightly punished; not only by our military, but by our armed civilian vessels as well."
			"Close relatives of your kind caused unimaginable damage to us. Perhaps, then, it is not so odd that we will watch you intently."
