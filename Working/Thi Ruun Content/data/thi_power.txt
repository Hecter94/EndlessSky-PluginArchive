	description "According to Thi'Ruun history, missiles just like this one were responsible for the death of the Kiel'Ruun race. In modern times, the missiles have been converted into miniature nuclear reactors, and are the main source of power for most Thi'Ruun ships."
	description "Though they're installed in missile racks for security and management purposes, Kindrender missiles are so large that they require additional outfit space beyond the rack's normal size."

	description "This is a rugged, versatile storage block for the Thi'Ruun's Reservoir EMP missiles. Though its primary function is a storage array, it also protects the missiles from unintended electrical discharge, resulting in rather robust power infrastructure for a race with so few shipboard energy generation options."
