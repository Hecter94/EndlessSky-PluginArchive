	description "Instead of trying to compare with Yurliakaeon with their heavyweight ship designs, Relac-Viule instead chose to go after Kalore-Illoca's market. The Malreg-Val-Lorai is a colossal freighter, developed relatively recently as far as Thi-Ruun ships go. Combining Relac-Viule's trademark speed with an incredible deal of cargo capacity, this ship sees plenty of use all across Thi-Ruun space."

	description "Relac-Viule is a widespread competitor to Yurliakaeon, with their ships providing a number of niches over standard Thi-Ruun vessels. For starters, their ships are extremely fast for freighters of their size, and are built around extremely strong central spines that give them staggering hull integrity."
	description "The Val-Lorai is their light freighter option, offering substantial cargo space with exceptional mobility. This is, however, at the cost of weapon space such as that provided by Kalore-Illoca's ships, or the flexibility of carry bays provided by Yurliakaeon's ships."

	description "The Val-Yurai is a refit and upgrade over Relac-Viule's extremely popular Val-Lorai. Though it lacks the significant cargo capacity of its twin brother, the Val-Yurai is far more suited to being a proper warship with enhanced combat systems and space for a light sortie of carried craft. This does come at a somewhat increased cost, and most Thi-Ruun captains stick with the freight version, but the Val-Yurai has achieved success thanks to its blindingly fast speed and exceptional durability."
