	description `Yurliakaeon's particularly strange, stick-shaped carriers may seem odd at first, but they are a model of how different sectors of the Thi-Ruun collective values different types of efficiency. Instead of hard-baked cargo holds or barracks, Yurliakaeon's ships use docking arms and a handful of purpose-built fighters, allowing a Thi-Ruun captain to swiftly and effectively "swap" a ship's primary functions to suit the job, instead of having to buy an entirely new ship.`
