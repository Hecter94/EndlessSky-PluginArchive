	description `Laxet-Mirum is a relatively modern arm of Thi-Ruun industry, dating back to the first century after the Thi-Ruun had discovered hyperdrive technology. Born out of a desire to break the trends of Thi-Ruun shipwork at the time, Laxet-Mirum's peculiar, mobius strip-like ships perhaps challenge the Protector's claim to being "the ugliest ship in the sky", but are examples of the vicious efficiency the Thi-Ruun are capable of manifesting.`
	description `The Laxet-Vermue is the smallest offering from Laxet-Mirum, relying on a surprisingly large payload of drones in addition to great quantities of anti-missile and disabling weaponry to pin a target in place before dismantling it.`
