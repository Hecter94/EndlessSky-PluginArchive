# Kor-Ramoret
 Adds a third Korath Automaton Faction to Endless Sky. The Kor Ramoret (or "Aggregated Korath") are a higher-tier automata faction made by combining aspects of both the Sestor and Mereti. They're a carrier-focused faction with powerful custom weapons, though they do share other Korath outfits (reactors, engines, cooling, et cetera).
