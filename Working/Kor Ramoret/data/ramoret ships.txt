	description "Kor Ramoret carriers are effectively their own self-contained fleets, with mixes of support and offensive craft. Though tiny, the Kei Rel Ul 7 packs a colossal gun for its size, enabling it to punch through multiple targets. A swarm of these fighters can quickly rip massed targets to shreds, leaving nothing left but pieces to be absorbed by the Kor Ramoret war machine."

While it is not quite as powerful of a dedicated warship as its Sestor or Mereti counterparts, it is an exceptionally powerful support capital ship, with the ability to deploy both carriables and minelaying missiles in droves."
