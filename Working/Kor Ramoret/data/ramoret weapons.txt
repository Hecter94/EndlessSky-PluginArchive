	description "This advanced computational unit maintains a basic AI persona, giving Kor Ramoret an unusual degree of creativity in battle that makes them much less easy to predict. However, the AI persona's self-preservation instinct means that Kor Ramoret Automatons are easier to capture than others."

	description "While much bigger than their Sestor ancestors, Disruption Repeaters are still very compact weapons for the effect on target they offer. The reduced reliance on superheating projectiles means the weapon can fire much faster without worries of cooling issues."
	description "	Unfortunately, the resultant weapon lacks it's predecessor's lethality, especially against hull."

	description "This is a vastly scaled down, fixed version of the Kor Ramoret's Entrencher. It lacks the slowing ability of its larger cousin, but retains a small amount of the target-penetrating ability, making it deadly even against large swarms of fighters."
	description "	The tightly focused beam means a small amount of damage will always leak through shields, but the weapon is best paired with others that can disrupt or rapidly destroy the target's shields."

	description "The Entrencher is a brutal weapon employed on the Kor Ramoret's capital ships. It fires massive, tightly-focused beams of energy that punch through all ships in their path, at the cost of a lengthy cooldown period after only a short period of fire. The incorporation of detainer-like elements in the design process results in a weapon that impales as it slows."

	description "Kor Ramoret Subdeployers are highly advanced hybrid missiles that combine the mobility of Piercers with the stopping power of Cluster Mines. Shortly after firing, the initial cluster breaks apart into a modest minefield, but deploys 4 smaller missiles that each ferry their own smaller payload of mines."
	description "	Naturally, such a system is quite large, but even a couple subdeployers can quickly soak a system in hostile mines."
