Fire Corporation:
	A manufacturing company, but not just that. Similar to the Deep with security and production. They make ships for bounty hunters (though they don't have to be used like that), and make an effort for them to be found anywhere (this means that you could buy their ship on a pirate planet, but the have a license "Not Pirate")

Storyline:

I WANT EITHER =, >, OR ~ OF 75 MISSIONS IN A SINGE PLAYTHROUGH!

Intro single: Pirate hunting mission for a pirate-made warship. Doesn't tell you about the ship, just like other bounties.

Fire Middle (Ideal: 35):

3. Meat up with the fleet on Calda.

5. Attack Zenith with a diminished fleet (unless you protected all of the Freedom attack fleet, as in use "to spawn	not "xxx destroyed"
6. Defend Zenith.
