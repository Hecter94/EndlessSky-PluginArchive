			`"Ah! There you are Captain," one of the Fire Corporation workers who recruited you comes over. "What information do you have for us?"`
			`	You explain how there was a pirate attack with modified ships fighting some other modified ships.`
			`	"Interesting," the worker thinks for a moment. "We will contact you later. Have fun with <payment>! You should get a Firestorm if you don't have one, using that money. It's about as good as a Falcon, but cheaper!"`
