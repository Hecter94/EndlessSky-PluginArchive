### endgame<br>
<br>
A series of dungeon-like boss encounters for a single ship. With loottables and weapon upgrade mechanism.<br> 
<br>
<br>
This plugin is co-authored by "Unknown_Rawrs" who did ship balancing, outfit design & brainstorming.<br>
It is designed as an endgame farming spot to gather rare high-end outfits and weapon upgrades.<br>
<br>
A new wormhole opened in north of the Betelgeuse system and a new Navy station got build at its side. As soon as you land on the station you get a single "key" to enter the wormhole. That means only your flagship can enter. The encounters are designed to be played with a vanilla endgame heavy warship and the best vanilla outfits.<br>
In each of the systems on the other side of the wormhole, you encounter a single heavy warship that tries to kill you, with partly special mechanics. As soon as you win a fight, or a series if fights, the wormhole to the next system opens, and you are rewarded with credits and two items, randomly chosen from a loottable.<br>
There are some landable planet, so you can save, repair, and refuel after each enemy.<br>
Some of the loot items increase the stats for the next fight, others allow you to upgrade your vanilla weapons at the Republic station(in 3 stages, 133%/166%/200%).<br>
This plugin is intended to be experienced like a typical RPG dungeon. You face three bosses, loot them, then the next area is unlocked, 2 more bosses with better loot, and then you can face the endboss with best loot.<br>
