# Weaknesses/Strategies:
# Tiger: Stay moving and have sufficient AM. A well placed Detainer shot will let you close the distance and lay into it, but don't let it face you directly.
# Battlestar: Use turrets with effective turning rates and run away until you've thinned the hoard. The thing itself won't put up too much of a fight, but be mindful of the shield piercing effect of the fighters!
# Valkyrie: Keep a decent reserve of power/energy generation and be mindful of heat. Don't get disabled and you should be fine.
# Defender: It has a small energy reserve, so it can't sustain its dps for too long. Ionize/overheat it before it's too late
# Basestar: A culmination of all that's been learned. Good luck.
