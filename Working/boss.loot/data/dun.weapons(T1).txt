	description "This lightweight turret can be fed a beam of light from a lasing generator, which is then combined and focused to produce an intense beam ideal for damaging other ships. By pulsing thousands of times each second, the beam can create thermal and mechanical shocks in the target material, enhancing its ability to drill through armor. Unlike the advanced beam weapons used by some other species, this laser is subject to the effects of diffraction, causing its damage to become less intense with distance while also rendering it invisible. However, precise optics allow the beam to be targeted from an exceptional range, despite the tenuous damage at the edge of the laser's reach."
	description "	The turret itself only contains the optics needed to synthesize, focus, and target the beam, allowing the laser light to be produced elsewhere. Because of this, an Optical Lasing Generator is needed to run this turret, providing enough power to support a single Blue Laser."

	description "This large vertical launch system is made up of 36 independent launch cells arrayed in parallel. A wide variety of small to mid-sized Avgi missiles are compatible with the launch cells, which can be easily interchanged. Designed for rapid vertical cold-launch, the system needs an open space comparable to a turret mount to function properly."
	description "	Vertical launch systems such as this one are capable of rapidly launching multiple missiles in parallel, but take up quite a bit of space."
	description "	Ammunition for this weapon can be restocked at any outfitter."

As such, they can often be dodged by faster or smaller craft, but if able to be equipped in numbers, they can create a deadly wall of fire.`

Combining destructive force with adjustable aim, Ballistic Cannon Turrets are the deadliest weapons of Vi warships.`

Each blast impacts the target ship almost instantaneously with a powerful hit, and a consistent amount of fire from Guile Lasers is extremely effective against slow moving targets.`

	description "An early stage in the development of better and faster weaponry to rival that of the Wanderers, the Tripulse Shredder consists of three Pulse Cannons in a single housing. Advancements in cooling capabilities have reduced the heat generated by each shot at the cost of drawing slightly more power. Additionally, the single shared housing results in a less consistent firing pattern, limiting it to bursts. These factors have made the Tripulse Shredder a popular hit-and-run weapon among the Unfettered."

	description "Typhoon Torpedoes are an improved torpedo technology; they do considerably more damage than ordinary torpedoes. However, they are also much slower, because they are intended mostly for use against large and slow-moving capital ships. As a result, sufficiently skilled pilots can often dodge around them."
	description "	Pods enable fighters and other light craft to carry small quantities of Typhoon Torpedoes into battle while retaining enough space for other weapons. Large ships are better off with full-size launchers."

Over a millennium later, this modern incarnation of the Gatling Gun sees action in the stars, a testament to its fundamentally robust design - and Dr. Gatling's naivete. While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description "The Stagnation Beam is one of the few technologies of the Incipias that surpasses anything humanity has made thus far - in fact, the first prototypes were built before the Incipias even dreamed of space travel. The weapon's origins lie in giant reactors that were constructed to pull asteroids out of their home planet's orbit, providing easy access to more resources. Naturally, a mechanism to slow the asteroids down was also implemented to prevent accidental asteroid strikes."
	description "	As the Incipias' mastery of spaceflight grew, so did the generators' efficiency, which allowed for more compact, ship-based tractor beams. Resource collection was greatly streamlined by these new models, much to the benefit of the Incipias' otherwise sluggish ships."
	description "	The secret of how these beams work is only known to a few scientists of the Incipias who are under the control of the state. Such knowledge, if made public, could have disastrous consequences for the Hicemus and their grip on power."

	description `Nearly a century ago, a Remnant scout exploring space north of the Ember Waste came under fire from an alien fleet armed with weapons that interfered with the scout's engines. The story says that the Remnant captain calmly told her crew, "We aren't going home until we steal that weapon." That alien technology became the basis of the Inhibitor Cannon.`
	description `	Although the Remnant appreciated the original weapon, they were disappointed that it was too big to fit on most of their ships. Instead of letting their effort go to waste, they instead opted to put their newfound knowledge to use creating a weapon suitable for their more nimble craft. Thus, the Inhibitor is excellent at controlling engagement distances, keeping targets at range by both pushing them backward with the impact of each shot while also slowing their approach by interfering with their engines.`

	description `While cannons that can interfere with a ship's engines are useful in any situation, the Remnant quickly decided that it would be even more useful as a turret that their ships could use to impede those chasing after them. These small Inhibitor Turrets are typically found primarily on Pelicans trying to outrun opponents rather than defeat them.`
	description `Although these turrets are unremarkable in terms of performance, the comparatively recent perfection of a technique of installing the bulk of the weapon itself externally on the turret mount instead of under the base has resulted in a weapon that takes comparatively little outfit space. It does, however, still add quite a bit more to the mass of the ship.`

	description "The Ember Wastes are an anomalous region subject to forces that defy conventional physics: Energy spontaneously pouring from the vacuum, material density far greater than one would expect to find in space - even around a nebula, a concentration of wormholes unheard of in the galaxy, and regions where the universe itself seems to be in flux. This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe."
	description "	When asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."

The missiles are fired in volleys of six at a time from each launcher, making them very effective at overwhelming point defenses despite their fragility. However, the low amount of fuel they carry means they can only home in on the target for about a second before they turn into unguided ammunition. Because they are manufactured on the spot, it takes a long time to reload."

	description `Precise and deadly, the Ojet Bimodal Coilgun has been the High Houses' armament of choice since long before humans ever took to the stars. It was designed quite simply as a perfect weapon; it is said that by the time the empire of the Predecessors fell, they had seen no need to install any other weapon on their ships for over a thousand years.`
	description `	The Ojet fires hyperdense packets of charged particles that disperse as they travel: up close the concentrated bolt pierces armor, while at a distance the ionic spray destabilizes shielding. Together, a ship equipped with these weapons can adjust its damage profile just by changing its engagement range, allowing it to be highly effective against any foe.`

	description "The largest and most powerful of the Successors' modern weapons, this massive superconducting coilgun is elegant in its simplicity, cleanly perforating targets at extreme range. Although the weapon requires a substantial burst of power in order to fire, it is capable of storing some of this within the coils themselves, allowing it to be fired without additional battery banks at the cost of inflicting a lingering power draw on the ship's systems."
	description "	Ammunition for this weapon can be restocked at any outfitter."
