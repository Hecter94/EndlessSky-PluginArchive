			`As the meeting opens, the Parliament attendees are concerned about the evidence presented from Navy Intellegence.  "Nothing of this nature has been identified in the latest Republic Intelligence reports," states one member.`
			`	However, as the briefing moves onto events in the now Extremist controlled systems, the mood of the meeting changes and the debate moves onto containment actions.`
			`	"The Navy is ready to initiate a blockade and prevent further expansion into nearby systems," states Darnforth.  "We also have support from the Free Worlds in this regard."`
			`	Katya continues "Our proposal is that we will then assemble our fleet in the <system> system, whilst the Navy gather elsewhere.  We can then launch a joint action on the uninhabited Persian system and hold the Extremists in the two isolated systems they currently occupy."`

Division is not good for business and I agree we must act.  I will discuss sending a fleet of our own to support the action with the Leadership.  I propose we put it to the vote."`
