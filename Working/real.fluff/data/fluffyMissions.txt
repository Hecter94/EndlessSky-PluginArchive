			`While inspecting the cargo hold, you hear noises and investigate. In a corner of the cargo hold, behind a few boxes of spare parts, you find a ferret playing with an electronic component lying around. The animal must have escaped from its cage somehow.`
			`When the ferret sees you, it runs towards you and climbs up your leg. At first the animal's behavior frightens you, but since it doesn't bite you but rather tries to play with you, you quickly calm down again.`
			`The tamed, playful ferret quickly grows on you. Of course, your first thought was to hand it over to the recipient of the ferret charge, but the more you play with it, the more you want to keep it. One less ferret out of 750 animals does not seem particularly serious. The more you think about it the clearer it becomes.`
			`You now have a new pet! You name the ferret 'Gummi Bear'.`

			`"Now we have a problem. We cannot accommodate the koala here. And since such a significant amount of credits have already been spent on the transport, we cannot afford a second transport. Captain <last>, it is not by chance that you are interested in taking over the koala and look after him? Otherwise we would have to put him down. I'm only asking because you've already proven on the way here that you are able to look after him."`
			`Since the koala's death would put too much strain on you, you accept the offer. After a little paperwork, you are now the proud owner of 'Archie' the koala!`
