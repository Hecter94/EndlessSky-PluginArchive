			`You ask for more details. The Countess appears to have been attacked by a pirate on an interstellar flight and a box containing valuable jewelry was stolen from her. Later investigations revealed that it was a local pirate who has his retreat somewhere in the Tortor, Mintaka or Gorvi system. The pirate flies a 'Raven' called 'Lootbox'. The Countess will pay 200.000 credits to get the jewelry back. The task shouldn't be too difficult, so you agree.`

You courageously try to convince the animal of your friendliness, which you quickly succeed in with a few strokes of petting. A plaque on his neck reads 'Babou'. You decide to take the ocelot with you.`

			`"Hello Captain <last>, I am looking for a cargo ship to deliver 30 tons of noble wood to <destination>. However, the noble wood would first have to be picked up from a private spaceport 500 kilometers west of here. Due to the circumstances and the value of the cargo my company would pay you 80,000 credits. Are you interested?"`
			`Although you know that private spaceports usually mean illegal business, but the payment tempts you considerably. As long as the shipping documents are in order, there shouldn't be any problems for you. You agree.`
			`The route to the private spaceport is quickly completed, but the landing turns out to be quite difficult. What was advertised as a private spaceport is nothing more than a clearing in the woods with a few cabins and a few patches of burnt grass. Loading the huge polished tree trunks takes all afternoon. Instead of robotic loading forklifts, everything here is done by burly lumberjacks. This gives you enough time to go for a walk in the forest. The forest has something primal about it. Smaller animals are scurrying around everywhere and twice you see something like a deer darting through the forest. You should treat yourself to some time in nature more often.`

			`Once you arrive on 'Hephaestus', the rapid unloading of your cargo begins immediately. In contrast to loading, heavy machinery is used here, which shortens unloading enormously. As the dockworkers unload the last logs, you notice a small, living thing fleeing back and forth in panic between the huge moving masses. You stop the unloading, climb over tree trunks and frozen loading robots and find a frightened raccoon in the back of the hold. He must have sneaked aboard in the Foundry forest. Coaxing and calming the raccoon takes longer than the previous unloading time, but when you carefully lift the raccoon and it remains relaxed, you realize that it was worth it. He's really cute and with a few feedings you'll definitely get him tame. You decide to keep him and call him "Bandit".`
			`A short time later the work is done and the 80,000 credits payment has arrived in your account. "Bandit" seems as happy as you are.`
