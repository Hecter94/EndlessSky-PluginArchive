A bunch of side missions which reward unique pets. <br>
<br>
Lore-friendly, totally useless, but cute pet outfits, with storylines. All missions have a 20% chance of appearing, except xenomorph and exotic mission which have 100%.<br>
<ul>
<li>Xenomorph - land somewhere in human space, hidden destination is Danoa system (based on the Alien movies)</li>
<li>The Exotic - land somewhere in human space, hidden destination is Unagi system (based on the Dark Star movie)</li>
<li>Cat - mission found on Deadman's Cove (Almach)</li>
<li>Ferret - mission found on Bivrost (Markeb)</li>
<li>Hamster - mission found on Twinstar (Alniyat)</li>
<li>Koala - mission found on New Portland (Delta Sagittarii)</li>
<li>Ocelot - mission found on Farpoint (Alnitak) needs 1000 combat rating</li>
<li>Rabbit - mission found on Starcross (Acrux)</li>
<li>Raccoon - mission found on Foundry (Achernar)</li>
<li>Squirrel - mission found on Heartvalley (Io Lowe, Hai space)</li>
</ul>
After collecting them all(except the two movie pets), you get a mission (20%) with unique reward.<br>
