### Louise Conglomerate Shipyards ###

**Author: [Loyse](https://github.com/loiseeer)**

**Requires**: Fundamental.Outfit.Expansion

An overhaul and republication of the [More Ships Plugin](https://github.com/loiseeer/The-more-ships-plugin). This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard *Louise*.

Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps with activities in many sectors. Its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design. Preferred shipyard of the Space Hansa, which despises Pirates, and has no trust at all in the ability of any government to solve this long-lasting issue.

Yeer e Ki Cooperative Shipyards reached out to the Louise Conglomerate, and signed a contract for a licensed production of 3 ship models on Makerplace, equipped with Hai technology, in an ambitious advance to mess up business of Imo Loo Meer Corporation and the Mon Ki i'Hiya Consortium.
