	description "Built for speed, the Louise Conglomerate's Antecursor class is employed to aggressively intercept dubious ships before they can pose a threat to the convoy it is protecting. Would-be pirates often mistake the two drone bays for cargo containers, a mistake they pay dearly for. The only pure warship class built by the Louise shipyards."

	description "The Bellator is a Mining Drone with two subtle modifications -- an additional gun port, and increased endurance allowing it to continue fighting when a regular Mining Drone would already be disabled. An astonishingly effective device enshadowing the Navy Combat Drone which makes any pirate regret his career choice as soon as being confronted with a wall of projectiles when attacking a convoy equipped with them."

	description "The Louise Conglomerate never paid attention to build midsized freighters, hence the Commercator class plays right away in the heavy league. An immediate success, it became the backbone of the Space Hansa trading convoys but also a popular choice for mining expeditions. The number of turret mounts make it a rather risky target for pirates, while still keeping to the doctrine of preferring smooth escapes."

	description "The Venditor class is Louise Conglomerate's risk-zone alternative to that common Syndicate freighter popular on the more peaceful inner trade lanes and which not even has a proper name. The Venditor was designed under the premise that a light freighter should be able to flee fastly into hyperspace, instead of risking a fight it would likely loose anyway. Nevertheless there are stories about daring junior traders who mount blaster turrets instead of anti-missile ones and go into counterattacks or even hunt smaller pirate parties. Not the smartest thing to do, but well, you know those youngsters."
