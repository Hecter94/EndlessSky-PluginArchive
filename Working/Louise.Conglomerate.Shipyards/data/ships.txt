	description "In order to capitalize on the abundant minerals hidden in asteroids, Louise Conglomerate's Harvester has a sizable cargo bay and enough gun ports to make the mining process fast and efficient. More robust than the Sunder, it is more suited for the Pirate-infested frontier areas, where the most promising prospect areas wait."

It was designed under the premise that a light freighter should be able to flee fast into hyperspace, instead of risking a fight it would likely loose anyway."
