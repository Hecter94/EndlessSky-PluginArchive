planet "Eteristra"
	landscape "land/eteristra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Eteristra is an undeveloped planet in the Pelitol Cluster. Eteristra acts primarily as a nature reserve."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is primitive, with very few landing pads. Most traffic into the planet descends into the atmosphere to land in places far away from the spaceport, presumably to record the planet's wildlife (of which a sizeable chunk was imported from Earth)."

planet "Delistra"
	landscape "land/delistra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Delistra is an undeveloped colony. Oratelis is of significant research interest however, so this planet is used as a hub for swarms of Surveillance Drones to enter space and scan the other planets."
	spaceport "The spaceport does not have much room for normal ships, but there are plenty of automated surveillance drone swarms."

planet "Moristra"
	landscape "land/moristra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Moristra is the northernmost colony in the Pelitol Cluster. Moristra is primarily an agricultural colony with the exception of the spaceport city, where the farmer's market resides (it takes up over 75% of the spaceport city's space)."
	spaceport "Moristra's spaceport is home to the farmer's market, where farmers sell their crops and the occasional tractor salesman approaches you, and asks if you want one. Notably, Moristra has very strong right-to-repair laws for tractors and farm equipment, so there are countless facilities where farmers modify their equipment or watch as repairmen, experienced or not, repair their equipment."

planet "Kaistra"
	landscape "land/kaistra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Even deeper into the Pelitol Cluster, is the planet of Kaistra. Kaistra is an even smaller outpost, a mere mining colony."
	spaceport "Kaistra's spaceport consists of a few landing pads, and the minimum required facilities."

planet "Defal VI Station"
	landscape "land/space2"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "This is an outpost. With more migration to the Pelitol Cluster, the SPA is discussing plans to convert this into a fuel generation factory, leeching off Defal VI, the gas giant that this outpost orbits. The station, located in the rings of Defal VI, is equipped with cannons on all sides to protect the station from asteroid impacts."
	spaceport "As standard procedure, there are fuel pumps. Not many people are here, and you feel like you're in a distant region of space. There is only one ship docked. The crew seem friendly and even let you view one of their plushies. Even in remote space, Freya Winters plushies run rampant."

planet Perechra
	landscape "land/perechra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Perechra is an Earth-like world and the easternmost world in the Pelitol Cluster. With a population of 12,000, the world's facilties are primitive and meet only the barebones basic standards of medicine, hygiene and other critical services. Perechra is most often used as a rest stop for ships making their way to either Kaistra or Salistra."
	spaceport "The spaceport is barebones, with just 5 landing pads for large ships. You see 4 small ships on one of the landing pads. People here give you weird looks, since not many people land often. Dental offices, shopping centers, and even a small hospital are visible from where you currently are."

planet "Salistra"
	shipyard "Sayari Advanced"
	shipyard "Sayari Heliarch Ships"
	outfitter "Sayari Outfits"
	outfitter "Common Outfits"
	landscape "land/salistra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Salistra is an Earth-like world in the Pelitol Cluster. Salistra is primarily a farming, manufacturing, and shipbuilding world. Salistra is home to the Salistra Shipyard in orbit. The colony of Kaistra in the neighbouring Sarut system is the Salistra Shipyard's primary source of material."
	spaceport "The Salistra Spaceport is located on an island in the middle of one of Salistra's large oceans."
