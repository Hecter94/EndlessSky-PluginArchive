# Korath Devourer
################################

# Previously, the Devourer had 3000 less weapon and outfit space. The new stats are to accomodate the switch from the Korath Incinerator to the Korath Smelter.
# See the outfits scrapyard file for details. TLDR: This is to stop players from selling the Devourer and installing the Incinerators on other ships.
