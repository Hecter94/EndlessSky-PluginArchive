	description "The Heavy Barrage cannon is an extremely long-range weapon capable of barraging larger ships with devastating volleys. Its range excels against other races, and with enough of these in your fleet, they can quickly take out any heavy warship. Its big weaknesses is its turning rate and firing rate, allowing quicker ships to evade it easily. Instead of a weapon that could lay down consistent fire, the engineers turned this weapon into a support weapon."
	description "This weapon works using a long-range shell with two fuses. The first fuse explodes out of the shell, crippling the enemy ship. The second fuse hits the ship's hull directly. These fuse explosions have a small blast radius which has been known to hit friendly ships caught in the blast zone, so this weapon is only meant to be used as an initiator."

	description "Most of the previous versions were scrapped after this model came out.
