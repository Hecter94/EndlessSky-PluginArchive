	description `Solar sails were first devised in the earliest days of stellar exploration, during the 20th-21st centuries, as a way to "sail" through space for long periods without needing to install engines or fuel. Its design hasn't been improved upon much since the invention of the Hyperdrive, except for newer lightweight materials. It's still used rarely by certain luxury cruise ships and some environmentalists, or even people on a strict budget. Now it's simply less practical and slow for most purposes, as it was built for probes that are as lightweight as possible, and not manned ships such as the ones we have today.`
	description `	Solar sails are weaker than Ion for the engine space they take up, but is of little weight and only ever uses energy to rotate sails in when turning.`

	description "This is a solar sail with four larger sheets instead of two, and gets moderate. It's mostly used on luxury cruise ships or some freighter captains. Although it's flashy, its actual pushing force leaves more to be desired, as it leaves pilots vulnerable to pirates if they can't escape fast enough.

	description "This is the largest commercially-sold solar sail available in known space. It looks ridiculous on anything smaller than a medium warship, letting you be seen from hundreds of kilometers away, but it does its job more efficiently than any one smaller. It can collect enough force to move a decently large ship at just enough speed to jump away from pirates."
#I say kilometers because I assume that the imperial system died out long ago.

	description `This solar sail is mounted on the front rather than the back of a ship. It's as capable of reverse thrust as the back-mounted one is at forward thrust, but its forward thrust, and its steering capabilities, is reduced to half.`

	description "These front-mounted solar sails are more popular than ones mounted on the back. It's often used by freighter or transport captains who have run out of engine space and have unused weapons space, as a way to get benefit from that extra space."
