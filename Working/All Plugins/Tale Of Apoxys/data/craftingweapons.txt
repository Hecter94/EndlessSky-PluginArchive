	description "The Dragonflame Cannon was already the largest, most powerful weapon humanity has ever seen. However, the forges located on New Boston seem to have been designed to power up any weapon, no matter the size. Incorporating Human and Korath tech into the design has resulted in an enormous, three-chambered design: A triple-chambered hand cannon, on a warship scale."
	description "Even if it wanted to, the entire weapon would not be able to fit in your weapon system; some of it ends up breaching the line and landing squarely in typical outfit space."

	description "By combining both the Sunbeam and the Korath Slicer, the Starcutter solves both weapons' respective issues: Lacking damage against either shield or hull, respectively. This does, however, come at the cost of weighing a considerable amount, even after paring off all turret components from the slicers, as well as consolidating each beam weapon to reduce redundant components as much as possible."

	description "The introduction of remnant inhibitor cannons to an otherwise less interesting korath grab-strike makes this weapon fearsome. It pairs two grab-strikes on the same mount, and causes engine interference in addition to pulling hard on the target. It is a more tactical weapon, however; its damage isn't quite as considerable as some may prefer."

	description "Forged from a Korath Detainer, an Ion Cannon, and a Korath Disruptor, the Multi-Disruptor is a fearsome weapon. Combining all of its component weapons into one potent package, the Multi Disruptor can disrupt the Shields, Engines, and Power systems of an enemy ship in a single blast."
	description "Of course, because it is an amalgam of multiple weapons, it is considerably larger than a more specifically designed weapon."

	description "Lightning strikes are high-powered hybrid missiles; when nearing a target, the primary missile quickly detaches its submissiles, hunting down it target at extreme speeds; The primary missile is armed with an EMP warhead that disrupts and drains enemy shields, allowing the slower secondary rockets to follow and finish the job."
	description "Because lightning missiles are so dependent on timing, they are manually remote-operated, so each launcher needs a small crew of missile pilots."
