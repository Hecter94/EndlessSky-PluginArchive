You now have access to select Quarg outfits once you depart and land again. There may be a special mission or two on the job board. You are also a fugitive from the Coalition.`

Observe the Heliarch's new ship prototype in Southern Wormhole 2. Return to Forpelog with your observations. Do not engage any ships there, simply watch from a safe distance. You will likely need to use your cloaking device for this mission. Feel free to loot the Heliarch ships after the battle.`

They are not cheap, so we will also let you purchase antimatter cores. If you are caught sharing any of our technology with anyone else, we will destroy you.`
