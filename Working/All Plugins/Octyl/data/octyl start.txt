			`You are escorted to a private docking bay on <planet> by a few Heliarch warships, and are greeted by a trifecta of the Heliarch as you disembark your vessel. A Saryd, a Kimek, and an Arachi, wearing golden Heliarch circlets.`
			`	"A great service," the Saryd starts, "we require of you. The first human in Coalition space, you are, and our most recent alien encounter, you have become."`
			`	"Like family, the three races of the coalition have become," explains the Kimek. "Forgotten how to negotiate well, we have, and comfortable with our friendship we have grown."`
			`	"Foreign arrivals, there are," the Arachi explains with a hint of urgency, "what to do with them, we know not. Help us, will you?"

			`	"The Coalition, they have not yet attacked," explains the Kimek, "A dangerous move at any moment, they could make, we understand."
			`	"How strong they are, we do not know," the Arachi admits solemnly, "With force rivaling the Quarg, they might be able to attack. We do not know. Which is why you, to help us, we ask."`
			`	After a moment of silence, the Saryd asks, "To ask us, do you have anything else, human <last>?"`

			choice
				`	"What if they attack, and you can't defend yourselves?"`
				`	"No, that is all, thank you. Do you know anything else of importance?"
					goto end
			`	The three look between each other, before the Arachi answers, "Run, we will, and your help we will ask for."`
			`	After a longer and more tense silence, the Saryd explained, "Uncertain, we are. Emotional and afraid, we are."`
			`	"What to do, we know not," adds the Kimek, "How this will play out, we must wait to see."`
			`	"If the visitors are friendly, we have barely considered," says the Arachi.`
			choice
				`	"This sounds like my kind of job. Do you have more details?"`
				`	"This sounds risky to me, what else do you know?"`
			label end
			`	"In vessels like huge asteroids, the alien visitors have arrived. Anything, they have not done yet." explains the Saryd, before instructing, "Fly with us to the visitors, we need you to, and meet with them."
			`	"If they are aggressive and do not want to negotiate," adds the Kimek, "we attack and push them out. If they do not respond to hails, we will explore their giant ship in search of them."`
			`	"If to assist us you wish not, leave you may." says the Arachi, "But if to assist us you wish, meet the Heliarch again in the spaceport."`

			`You spend some time idling near the docking bays of the Ring of Friendship, waiting for Heliarch agents to instruct you further. While waiting, you notice the activity on the ring world had picked up considerably. Double, perhaps triple the activity you're used to seeing.`
			`	On top of the increased activity, the atmosphere seems more tense than usual. Groups of Heliarch agents rushing to and from ships, tending to the ringworld, preparing their warships. Wide-eyed, you watch a large group of Heliarchs ferry shipments of Quarg equipment, and install them onto veteran-looking Punishers.`
			`	After watching the seventh Skylance being installed, a triplet of the Heliarch approach you. "Captain <last>, you are?" asks the Saryd, "Weapons, you hold? Assistance, we may need."`

			`	"Prepare, you must," advises the Saryd, "Time, we suspect we do not have."`

			`	The three turn away, and help install an eighth and final Skylance onto a Heliarch Interdictor. Once their work is done, you are allowed to see their handiwork.`

				`	"It's a masterpiece, I'm sure they'll do well."`
				`	"It's not the best, but it will have to do."`

					goto logistics
			`	"Well, they must do," says a passing Saryd, "or trouble the Heliarch will find itself in."`
			`	"Not pretty, they are," says a Kimek, "But work they must do. Not always pretty, war is."`
			label logistics
			`	"So much power, the Quarg Skylances use," pipes in an Arachi, "Batteries, we must rely on. Enough power, our reactors cannot provide. But in bursts, if we fire, just as strong the weapons remain."`

			`As you guide the fleet of Heliarch warships to the modest spaceport of Flowing Fields, you watch the few families of Saryd that live nearby approach the ships with awe, disdain, or a mix of the two.`
			`	Then, you turn around and see many, many more pouring in from the skies. You try to keep track, but you lose count some time after the fifth Punisher flies in for landing. After several minutes of waiting for the fuss of the locals to calm down, a trio of Heliarch agents confront you.`
			`	"To Lone Cloud, we have pinpointed our visitors," explains the Saryd, "To Lone Cloud, we shall fly. A fight, you should expect, <last>."`
			`	"What they may do, we know not," says the Kimek.`
			`	"If the Coalition will ultimately survive, we know not," spouts the Arachi.`

				`	"We will survive whatever is beyond that hyperspace link."`
				`	"If we talk to them, whatever they are, maybe we don't have to fight."`
				`	"Maybe your Skylances are enough to scare them away."`

			`	"Meet we the Heliarch back in the spaceport," says the Kimek, "when you are ready."
