		log "Persons" "The Handler" "The Handler is the 'caretaker' sent by Arion to supervise you and help you with your mission."
		log "Factions" "Arion" "Apparently, Arion is not from this reality. They are a nation of mainly humans who explore multiple worlds and blend in to research new tech and learn about the world. Their tech is both incredibly good and incredibly expensive, making them use quality over quantity tactics."

To help you with this, you should head over to Luna. There, you should head over to this location and you should be able to purchase some equipment in our secret FOB.'"

			"	You approach the coordinates. As you approach, a gate in a crater de-cloaks and opens. You enter the newly formed hole and see a railgun pointed at you, ready to fire if you were hostile. When you exit your ship, what looks to be the officer in charge of the base and his guards greet you."
			"	'This base is where you will be selling us ships to study and purchase tech from us to complete your missions.'"
			"	You are then lead first to the base's shipyard. It isn't really a shipyard per say but more of a holding area for ships. Next you are lead to the outfitter where you can see the outfits that you will be using in the future. Finally, you are lead to the gun store. Inside, there are all sorts of firearms ranging from the small handguns to 50 cal anti material rifles. You know that you will have all the tools needed to complete your mission from now on."
