			`	When you jumped in, you saw a station in a see of nothingness. There is nothing in this 'system' besides this station, which is probably why it was able to stay so near to Sol without being detected. It is a large station, you can see multiple places for your ship to dock and you can also see multiple lasers, railgun and missiles batteries all over the station. The Handler directed you to dock at Docking station 10.`
			`	When you dock, you can see a group of people waiting to greet you and all of them are armed. The ones that look like guards are wielding the standard Arion assault rifles while their leader has a 'hand cannon' on their hip. However weirdly enough, not all of them human. There are some aliens among them. The Handler notices your confusion and says to you, "Well, Arion is mostly comprised of Humans, but there are multiple species that are a part of Arion."`
			`	Their leader approaches you. It is an alien, standing at 3 meters tall. Their appearance is similar to a dragon but without wings and bipedal.`
			`	"Hello Captain <first> <last>," the alien speaks to you. "My name is Eliza. I am the Expedition Commander."`
			choice
				`	Hello.`
				`	You're an alien!`
					goto alien
				`	What is an expedition commander?`
					goto expeditioncommander
			`	She smiles. "Good, you aren't surprised to see an alien. But why am i surprised, you should have at least seen one alien species during your adventures or seen an alien during on the missions we assigned to you."`
				goto continue
			label alien
			`	She looks at you with confusion and then giggles. "Haven't you explored the galaxy? Even if you stick within human space, you should have at least seen a Quarg before. I'm not quite sure why you are surprised to see me."`
				goto continue
			label expeditioncommander
			`	"Alright so, our rank system is a combination of the US, UK and NATO rank system. However, we also have a few special ranks that are in kind of a weird position. 2 examples of this are you Handler's rank and mine. My rank is higher than pretty much higher than anyone in this expedition but it is maybe only an 0-7 to anyone outside of this expedition."`
				goto continue
			label continue
			`	"Anyways, we really should continue with the base tour. In this base you will have further access to the technologies we have." The Handler and Eliza then brings you first brings you to the shipyards. "This is the best part of getting access to this base," The Handler tells you. "You get access to the better ships we own." "Not only that Captain," Eliza also tells you. "After this we will be bringing you to the outfitter, there you can get some of the best equipment we have, including our specialty, the Railgun." At the Shipyard, you can see multiple ships available for you to purchase on a data pad. You can see that some new ships available to purchase include Superplanes and Heavy Warships.`
			`	You are then brought to the Outfitter. At the outfitter, the Handler and Eliza shows you the advanced lasers, E.M.Ls and nuclear weapons that are now available to be purchased by you. There are also improved cloaking, electronic warfare and repair systems that are available.`
			`	After that you are brought to the armory and shooting range. When you reach the firing range, Eliza asks you a question. "Did the Handler already teach you about basic firearm handling." Before you can respond however, the Handler responds for you. "Damn, i forgot to teach em that. I sure hope you read the guide book if you purchased any of our h2h outfits. But just in case we should at least teach you basic firearm handling." Eliza than picks out 2 guns from the Armory. "Alright, i have 2 choices for you here, you can try out this AKs 74u or this AK 74."`
			choice
				`	AKs 74u`
				`	AK 74`
					goto ak74
			action
				outfit "AKs 74u"
			scene "outfit/pirateak74"
			`	"Alright here is your Aks 74u, it is a carbine firing the 5.45 by 39mm ammunition. This gun is basically the smaller more compact brother of the Ak 74."`
				goto gun
			label ak74
			action
				outfit "AK 74"
			scene "outfit/pirateak74"
			`	"Alright here is your Ak 74, it is an assault rifle firing the 5.45 by 39mm ammunition. This one is an older model with a wooden grip and buttstock."`
				goto gun
			label gun
			`	The Handler then gives you your new gun.`
			choice
				`	Point the gun in a safe direction and put your finger off the trigger.`
				`	Play around with the gun and point it at the targets.`
					goto safety
			`	Seing that you handled the firearm carefully, the Handler congratulates you. "Good, it appears that you are at least familiar with basic firearm safety."`
				goto firing
			label safety
			`	Before you are able to play around too much and harm yourself, Eliza takes the gun away from you and scolds you. "Damnit, we didn't load the damn gun but you really shouldn't treat that like a toy! Finger off the trigger and point it to a safe direction."`
				goto firing
			label firing
			`	You are then given a full magazine and are then presented with targets to shoot down range. "Fire at the targets downrange Captain," the Handler tells you. You then fire a few shots at the targets. "Not bad," says the Handler. "You hit most of your shots so i guess you are somewhat competent with a firearm. Alright i guess now we will go to the Spaceport."`
			`	When you enter the spaceport, you can see a lot of entertainment devices. The spaceport looks less like a spaceport and more like an arcade. There are multiple VR setups that can be used to train infantry, multiple tank simulators and multiple flight simulators. There is also a canteen in the spaceport serving a lot of different kinds of food. You can see a few Captains, Pilots and Soldiers enjoying themselves. "Since you now have access to this base, you are now allowed to use all this equipment too Captain," Eliza tells you. "Just, don't break anything, these setups are expensive and you are probably gonna pay for any broken devices."`
			`	"Well that concludes the tour for now, I'm sure that all of us have places to be right about now. Hopefully you will enjoy all the new equipment that you now have access to Captain."`
