It now serves as one of the main drones for the Arion Air Force, Arion Foreign Legion, SFF and other allies to Arion under the designation 'FQ-101'. These drones can be operated as loyal wingman and as a defense system for the 'Arsenal Bird'. Although, this is an earlier version that still has the X-47 designation and is being sold as surplus."

It is used mainly by the Arion Marine Corps and the Arion Army Air Corps as an attacker and a light fighter. While it isn't the best for A2A roles, its cheapness, ruggedness, maneuverability and ability to take off from almost any road has made it very useful. It is also used in the Arion Air Force, Arion Navy and Arion Foreign Legion mainly as Trainers. It is also very popular with civilians and mercenaries due to its low cost."
