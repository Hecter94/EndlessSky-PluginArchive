	description "This is the only Builders ship that hasn't been completely destroyed by the Ka'het. Concealed for millenia under the ocean waves of Retilie, it was found by Lu Bu during the Grave Digger's exploration of the Graveyard. Lu Bu never completed salvage operations, but a few former Grave Diggers knew of the derelict's location."
	description "The ship's original outfits couldn't be salvaged. The Grave Diggers have replaced them with Ka'het outfits."
