	description "A pair of modified heavy pulse pistols favored by some Unfettered and the occasional pirate captain. Dual wielding them adds another gun during short raids against a ship's defenders. Individually, they lose their energy charge more quickly than a pulse rifle, making them a poor choice for holding a defensive position during a long siege."

The blade is forged from a single Quantum Key Stone of the highest quality. A design of the micro circuitry in the hand grip, the technological secrets of which have been lost to antiquity, sends a charge through the blade that alters the wielder's quantum alignment, granting the ability to walk through walls or other solid matter."
