	description "These wormholes are too small for anything larger than a drone to fly through. The aperture is unstable and can shift locations, or collapse entirely, at any moment. The few drones that do make it through seem to have their programming scrambled, perhaps a result of the strange bolts of energy surrounding the phenomenon."
