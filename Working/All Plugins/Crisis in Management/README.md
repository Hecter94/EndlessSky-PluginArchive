# Crisis in Management, a Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky

v0.9

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

> Leave your failing company and take to the stars to escape repercussions, then find yourself in the background, behind the scenes of Endless Sky's main storyline.  
> Beyond that, the same, endless, sky awaits.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky, or install with ESLauncher2 (available there soon I hope).

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the most recent release. If perchance you're playing this in the future and it doesn't work any more, please let me know and I'll try to fix it for current release.

## Current status

Approximately complete. There are a few things I want to improve sometime (feel free to help speed that up by telling me how much you loved... or hated but want to love, the plugin). For that and for bug reports you can open an issue or discussion on Github, or dig through the files to find my email address.

## Contribution and Copying

Many thanks to everyone at Endless Sky, without whom this wouldn't make a lot of sense, and would never have happened. Special thanks to samrocketman who gave advice on tidying up the licence and things.

The text of this I release into the public domain. While, if you publish an altered version of this story I'd appreciate if you let me know or even ask me first; but I place no legal restrictions on this and have waived my copyright.
