# notes

- ScS Armchair Rights 2: currently still has a passenger for the message! Could rework to missions-in-series
- ScS Union Thought 4: would be follow the Rolling Stone from Delve to Covert but game mechanics don't support that!
- ScS Unionise/bust: can do by shooting down syndicate advisors shuttle or your escort with them!
	+ "Angry you made them late"... metaphorically!
- ScS Unionise 2: does it make sense they can't get food because no pay?
	+ does it need to be much more food
	+ State that it's because deliveries blocked from coming from them or something like that
- ScS Amazons 1 - set some unfriendly npcs against the escort?
- ScS Downs 2 (and ARA something?) can, I think, leave behind passenger for stopovers! might need to re-do as individual missions
- ScS Coventry piracy - could make hostile to everyone (a la pirate) but no fleets in system, for that mission...?
- ScS Coventry 3: want to have defer option, but that makes timer on (2) tricky
- Coventry 3: also description a bit unclear about what missions have to complete to complete this?
- Coventry 3: feels like plot holes re the general availability of automation
	+ Also, Can't Sophie use an escape pod?
- A touch awkward if do 3a2 then 3b; have to re-land
- ScS Extreme Flight 3: how acceptable to have urgent message come while in flight? Messages almost always only on planets, but some in-system communication happens in-flight
- actually which 'recent battle' spurred Sawyer to defect?
- ScS Extreme Flight (?) "profiting from the death of millions": what is the death toll of the bombs and the war?
- mission where payment is within branch ('killed' or handed in Peterson) can be cheesed by multiply-reloading for unlimited credits
- Home Sweet Home: can't have personality surveillance on following ship, or it keeps jumping away
	+ It still follows you, but keeps jumping in and out of system. This behaviour is not documented on the wiki [bug]
- armchair rights 2: another dialog-to-accept
- ScS Armchair Rights 3: engine insufficiency, thereofre all NPCs start already coming.
	+ and... the pirates run out of fuel!! had to make high-fuelled versions in case you just leave before they arrive
- Union Shadows: "But yes, because our interest is in the S worlds" - can reword a bit?
- [bug] reload mid-conversation choosing whether to transport syndicate in Syndicate Weedkiller.... enables both options at the same time!
- Coventry ideas, meet ARA - "new respect for Arnold, since you found out".. but you didn't necessarily find out
- If choose both options (by reloading in conversation), get neither!
- [mild bug] failing ask-joe/ask-ara doesn't knock them off mission tracker until reload or re-land.
	+ might fix to fail on-complete instead of on-offer, but that might muck up using `...:done`
- ideally do alternate ship dialogue for the decoy Queen
- used to be sawyers evidence on Charybdis. Text works better there; but helpful for routing to have on Antipode
