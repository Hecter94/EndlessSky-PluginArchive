Main Blockades

- 1) Syndicate Moktar,Zaurak: Alpha Abduction 1-3
- 1) Merchant Mirfak,Ruchbah: Alpha Abudction 1-3
- 2) Merchant Alpheratz,Markab,Zaurak
	+ Alpha Abduction 4 -- Villains 2
- 3) Merchant Ruchbah,Markab,Ankaa Alpha Letter -- Alpha Hunt 1
- 4) Merchant Ankaa,Diphda,Sirius,Acamar Alpha Hunt 2
- 5) Merchant Caph,Fomalhaut,DeltaC,Sol post Alpha Hunt 2
- 6) Merchant Menkent,Sol,Fomalhaut,DeltaC Alpha Hunt 3 -- The Top
- 6) Navy Menkent,Sol Alpha Hunt 3 -- The Top

More:

- Downey 5-6 can be stopover on C Station + to-spawn once you stop over
- aren't actually informed on-screen to go to Silver/Vega with Romeo. Maybe fix that!
- ScS syndicate trusted stays; jobs depending on it have not-offered once `event: syndicate occupies sol`
- event: battle for zeta aquilae is ignored: clears fleets for battle, but doesn't restore. (also sets player reputation) Seems unnecessary to follow
- (end) battle for alioth also ignored: seems to change fleets then reset.. but haven't checked carefully
- having the blockades be 'surveillance' means they sit on planets.... so took that off to make them roam. Most don't have scanners anyway I think
- for consistency with main-game, in case someone uses the fact, syndicate gvmt are returned to neutral with alphas. N.B. this means if main-game updates this to be naturally hostile, ScS will overwrite and need fixing!
- consider the planet restrictions set up for FW storyline (but present in common events). Maybe alter for Syndicate... or maybe they're just higher security while war's on. AFAIK they just set higher reputation needed to land? Or are particularly paradise planets not letting a FW captain land?
- ARA "sounds less worried than you expected" even if 90 women were killed on the King Lear... maybe branch that
- Aborting disable-or-kill missions still fails and treats as kill!
- Nimbus blockade: maybe better to drag out conversation with `choice (more)`s a bit, to feel the timing
