# notes and TODO:

- Get rich 0: "crossroads is in" in brackets?
- Get Rich 1: join meeting in spaceport? or straight on landing?
	+ generally early missions have spaceport and later are direct on landing
- Catch a Fly 1: autosave before join?
- Records - "why don't you just call them" - "I'm sure they're safe" -> "Of course they're safe" ?
- Catch a Fly 2: bit awkward not to have a dialog on each landing
- Catch a Fly 4: risk of a dialog accept if player hits 'd' reflexively
	+ this is general issue with game. Maybe need list of rejected missions to re-accept before take-off?
- Uncle to 2nd wife- dialog with accept/reject is awkward
	+ could do dialog on-complete + automatic on-land-accept-mission
- not a great transition to working direct for Syndicate. Would seem obvious to go back to WCW for more work, if no text otherwise
- looks like recapture of korne will almost always come first before break 20day min, even on pretty fast route
- double-spaced messages: quotes or not quotes?
	+ No quotes in "don't look back"; others now have quotes I think
	+ The one in An Edge 0 looks bad without quotes; but with, maybe better to remove double-spacing
- Wifery, ln588, "...Maurissa" - full stop or not full stop?
- I wonder if it's possible to cancel fleet changes to Sheratan (Fight Club 1b) rather than re-write a copy of the original
- ScS Fight Club 1b: check balance: might need to reduce companion fleet strength
- [bug] Abduction 2b doesn't recognise your passenger.
	+ Failure is delayed: if he dies but you land on crossroads before any other planet, you complete 2b anyway
	+ also can land on 2b with escort lagging behind
- [todo] test downey's office w/o completing Package Delivery; also logs on Downey in both cases
- ScS Quarg Query: should come after First Contact if not yet met Quarg.
	+ But it doesn't. Maybe it's okay this way
- if Militia (Rogue) government as +0.1 toward FW,
	+ Makes sense that they respond favourably to you helping the FW
	+ But also means you could help FW enough before that mission, and they won't attack you... but will attack your escorts
- ScS Tarazed 3: Wolf Packs will fight republic ships if there are, rather than aiming for your convoy.
- Wife side-plot: better to space out (& start) with random chance or measured gap?
- Potential bug in Wifery 4: if you select maurissa only, then reload, then select lily only and finish, you now have no options!
- Syndicated Espionage: go to lovelace.... need clearance
- BIG NOTE! Sheratan has had korath raid fleets adjusted (from Korath Raid to Korath Large Raid) - might need to keep an eye on this to remove-renable correctly!
