# Bootstraps

Pull yourself up by your bootstraps.

- 0 Meet co-pilot come advisor
- 1 ballerina troupe to exec party: most of payment goes on them, you get little
- 2 sewage transport  - at leas this time get some money on an outfitter planet
- 3a disable fleeing manager's ship
- 3b OR refuse and be chased out of the system - "I already signed you up for it, people are going to be angry"
	+ [todo] bug: can be offered after completing 3a. fixed immediate issue but not tested or thoroughly checked
- 4 pick up strike breakers from (far planet) and bring to
- 4a (low passenger space) escort strike breakers from (far planet)
- 4b and escort to
- 5 take scientist to Mutiny

Sc Package delivery

- "the big one" take 'package' to drop off on clink, see flash in background as you go, worry you won't get paid! get paid anyway. Hint: spend your money quick at a shipyard/outfitter before bank takes it all! Co-pilot leaves at end (hint he's got big bonus from this - add person ship gvmt syndicate)
- 1 to new iceland
- 2 try new portland
- 3 hope...
- 4 finally clink
- 5 return to Shangri-La for your pay.
- OR if war imminent, sorry, co-pilot just got another job you're on your own. Fly him to his new job on Shangri-La

other

- Katya karate fail
- warning about letting time pass deviously, or buying smaller ship

## Notes and TODO

Intro awkward for newbies

- First missions should auto-happen, or come on landing. Going to spaceport on very first mission is awkward

Money: still lots of loan left at the end... maybe better to up the repayment to 10M?

- Have upgrade from 8M to 10M
	+ quick test with no-cheating left with 4M loans after 8M payment
	+ And ship+outfits would sell for 1.919M
- maybe still fine to pay off, with that big ship
- but big ship takes 5k/day salaries
- and could be frustrating, even if fair-ish compared to main
- then again, mostly not 1st time players playing this module

Newbie hints

- need more hint on get-strike-breakers mission, about 'find you way in tricky hyperlinks' and do quickly bc deadline
