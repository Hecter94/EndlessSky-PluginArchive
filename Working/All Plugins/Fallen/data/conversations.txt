	`"<first>... Wake up, <first>.  Wake up, <first>.  WAKE UP!"`
	`A torrent of thoughts and emotions flash through your head too fast to make sense of as your world suddenly blinks into focus.  Your shoulders ache.  So does your chest.  You realize that your brain is screaming at your to remove the huge scratchy thing in your throat.  Reflexively you reach up and grab hold of the bundle of tubes sticking out of your mouth.  Just as your hand is closing around the tubes, you hear a loud gurgling noise and you feel the fluid around you start to move.  You decide that the fluid feels cold.  Your instincts implore you to pause in your removal of the tubes until the fluid level lowers past your face.  The moment it does, you yank the tubes out.  You sputter and cough, and suddenly you find that you've projected whatever was in your stomach into the pool of goo draining at your feet.`
	`Your vision is still very blurry; probably from the goo that is still covering your eyes and face.  In a moment you find yourself alone and cold in the transparent tube that you were floating in moments before.  With a hiss, the tube opens.  You take a deep breath of air and take a moment to try to collect yourself before stepping forward.  The tube had a small lip to step over, and your legs aren't quite doing what you tell them to, so you end up on your hands and knees on the cold, hard deck.  A small jolt of pain shoots through your wrists as your palms slap the smooth floor.`
	`The voice that you awoke to returns, filling the room from unseen speakers.`
	`"Hello, <last>, <first>.  Welcome to Relic Station.  My name is Oracle.  I will assist you in orienting your person and equipping you for your mission.  Please follow the lit path on the floor to the construction yards."`
	`	When the friendly, if brief AI stops speaking, a small, glowing line appears on the floor leading away from the hibernation tube.  As you pull yourself to your feet and start putting one foot in front of the other, you find that your senses return to you quickly, and before long you are walking at a fairly normal pace.  The voice returns.`
	`	"You are a "Sleeper".  The [data corrupted] Empire placed agents such as yourself into hibernation to awaken only if no [data corrupted] vessels were left flying in known space.  The last time a [data corrupted] vessel was detected by this station was [error: variable outside parameter] years ago.  Your mission is to use the resources available to you to retake this section of space for the [data corrupted] Empire."`
	`	After walking through several different corridors and passages, you come to a set of large doors which glow the same color as the floor light.  As you approach, the doors open.  The room on the other side is dark, but as lights slowly start flickering on you can see that the room is massive, and most of it is taken up by what looks like an indoor automated construction yard.`
	`	"Please approach the terminal on the far side of the room.  You will find an interface detailing this facilities current shipyard capabilities.  This station will automatically order raw materials from local suppliers for construction purposes, but these materials cost galactic currency.  This station is currently equipped with two point seven million credits worth of resources.  If you bring more credits to the station, it will order more raw materials for the construction of your fleet."`
	`The terminal glows in front of you.`
	`	"Please use the terminal to order the construction of a Seeker reconnaissance vessel."`
