Kestrel Rework Readme:
This is a small rework of the Kestrel ship. The intent is to put it on par with several higher tiered alien outfits, most notablely Wanderer (2) outfits, as opposed to standard Human (1-1.5) Outfits. 
This does not make much sense according to the lore, but I personally prefer the asthetic of the Kestrel compared to many of the Wanderer ships. as such, the changes are as follows:

-The requirements for the Kestrel sub-quest have been changed:
	-The combat rating was increased from 8,000 (Combat rank 9: "Force to be reckoned with") --> 22,000 (Combat rank "Fearsome Scrapper). Intended to limit obtaining the newly buffed ship until the player is on a similar power level.
	-Increased the standard cost of the ship from 14700000 --> 67500000, as another change intended to limit how early a player could obtain the ship.
	-Buffed "Unknown ship type" by roughly half of the changes to the base Kestrel (I.E, instead of 49,700 shields, the test ship will have about 23,000), increasing the difficulty of the inital test fight while not requiring too much power to win.

-Base model "Kestrel" (Unlisted stats were not changed)
	-Shields 19,400 --> 49,700
	-Hull 7,200 --> 30,400
	-Fuel Capacity 500 --> 700
	-Outfit space 810 --> 900
	-Weapon capacity 390 --> 410
	-Engine Capacity 210 --> 230
	-Bunks 128 --> 150

	-Drag -1.0 --> -2.0
	-Fuel Capacity 100 --> 300

	-Shields 3,000 --> 28,000
	-Hull 1,500 --> 4,900
