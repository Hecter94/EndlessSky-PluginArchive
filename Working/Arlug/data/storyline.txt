The high-(he trails off into indecipherable sentences)-wants to see you." and beckons you to follow. You follow him inside a larger fancy  building, and the guard beckons you up the stairs and resumes his post outside. Do you want to go upstairs or downstairs?"`

			`	You step up the stairs, which are very steep. At the top you find a typical alien siting in a very nice carved chair. He says, "My name is Orik, I'm the ruler of this group of Arlug." He pauses. "Could you go to <destination>? You will find a friend of mine there, although he won't understand you."`

				`	"Yes, I will if you will get me some means of translation."`
					goto accept
				`	(say something that indicates you won't listen)`

			label frustrated
			`	"How am I supposed to go bring your friend here if he won't understand me? I'm taking off and leaving this planet for good. I don't like people who give me jobs that are impossible to complete." Orik leans back in his chair with his eyes closed. "Very well," he says, "you won't listen." Then his face changes. "You leave this planet right now. And I'm telling you you're no longer a friend, or not enemy, of the Arlug." The guard escorts you back downstairs, and takes you to your ship. You start the autopilot to launch.`
