	description "The S-970 Shield Regenerator is an advanced type of shield recharging technology. Unfortunately, its power needs are rather high, and the shifts it makes in your shield configuration also result in some feedback that causes heat to build up in the regenerator, even when your shields are at full strength."

	description "Ramscoop technology has been almost unchanged for centuries, because with nearly every system in human space settled there has not been a pressing need for ships to generate their own fuel. But with the Free Worlds war making travel once again more difficult, some engineers in the Deep recently invented a much-improved ramscoop for use in their merchant fleets."
