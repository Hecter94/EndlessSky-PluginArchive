			`	As you were walking around to enjoy being on the ground, a man walked up to you and ask, "Are you Captain <last>?"`
			choice
				`	"Who wants to know?"`
				goto identify
				`	"Yes, indeed I am. Can I help you?"`
				goto introduction
			label identify
			`	"Dont's worry, you are not in trouble," he replies. "I know who you are. There is something I would like your help with."`
				goto introduction
			label introduction
			`	"Please follow me."`
			`	You follows him into an small bar. During this time of day, you are not surprised to see that the bar is pretty empty. But before you know what is going on, two more men appear out of nowhere.`
			`	"Please have a seat," the man points at the closest chair. After you sit down, all three men sits down around you. Not exactly the most comfortable position to be in, but you ignore that for now.`
			`	The man introduces himself, "My name is Bill Orrs. I'm the local government advisor." He looks to the man in Republic Navy uniform, "That's Major Kesiner. He's the assigned Republic Navy liaison." Orrs turns to the third man, "And this is Syndicate Representative Peon."`
			choice
				`	"So what is going on? Am I being charged with anything?"`
					goto clarify
				`	"Enough with the pleasantry. Can we move onto the main topic?"`
					goto situation
			label clarify
			`	"No, of course not. We just want to be clear about how serious what we about to tell you is."`
				goto situation
			label situation
			`	Orrs starts, "One hour ago, we detected a Republic Navy carrier entered. Representative Peon contacted the Major immediately as the Republic Navy rarely make an appearance in the Syndicate space, much less in a major system such as this one."`
			`	Major Kesiner continues, "I checked with Navy High Command and was told that the <npc> was supposed to be on patrol with her fleet near the Phurad system..." Peon jumps in, "We tried to contact the carrier, but there was no response. On any channel."`
			`	Orrs throws Peon a weird look, then turns to you. "They came to me since mobilizing any military asset would be too risky right now. Since you are well-known throughout the galaxy, we would like to ask you to investigate the <npc>."
			choice
				`	"What do I get out of this?"`
				`	"Of course. I will prepare my ship immediately."`
			`	"We will have <payment> ready for you when you return."`
			`	"Here are the authorization codes to extract all data from her central computer." Kesiner hands you a small case. "We would like to know what happened." Before you turned away, he whispers, "This carrier should never been here in the first place. Make sure it stays that way."`

			`	On board, there is no sign of life. There is no sign of any combat either. It's as if everyone just disappear where they were. You extract the data like Kesiner asked, then head for your ship. Now it's time to erase this from existance.`

			`	Once you landed, you head toward the bar. All three of them are waiting there.`
			`	After you told them that you found absolutely nothing on the <npc>, they look at each other for a while, then finally Kesiner asks, "Where's the data?"`
			choice
				`	"I will hand it over if you share it with all of us. Something is very wrong on that ship."`
				`	"Here you go!"
			`	"I don't think that keeping information to myself is of any use anymore." Kesiner replies. He pulls out a portable device then plugs in the data chip. He searches the security video for a few minutes to find out what happened to the crew, then turns to us, "Are you ready?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Is there any other option?"`
			`	"Here we go." Kesiner taps the screen. Everything was normal, the crew of the Revenant was just performing their normal duties...`
			`	Until, as if they all heard something, all at the same time, stopped what they were doing. They stood up, then marched towards the fighters bay. Then, one person, who appears to be the captain, went up to the control room. He showed no emotion as he entered the code or even as he was about to push the button."`
			`	"Stop!" Orrs yells. "Major, explain. What the hell is going on?"`
			`	Kesiner pays no attention to Orrs, staring at the screen as hundreds of people were dumped into the void space. No sound. No body. No battle. Just death.`
			`	It takes a while for us to regain our thought process. Peon is the first to speak, "Captain <last>, it's needless to say that what you just saw is classified of the highest level."
			choice
				`	"I understand..."`
				`	"Hundreds of people just committed suicide and you are worried about that?"`
			`	Orrs looks at the others then says, "Captain, thank you for helping us. I think representative Peon is right. For now, please keep this a secret. We will reach out to you again once we have more clue of what is going on."`

			`	When you open up your hangar door, you find yourself greeted by a woman in a typical Republic Navy uniform. She doesn't say anything, just hands you a data chip then leaves.`
			`	You plug in the chip and play the message stored inside.`
			`	Orrs shows up on the screen, "Captain <last>, I hope this find you at an ideal time. Situations similar to what we have seen at Alderamin have been reported. I can't really say more here, but please, come to Earth. I think we have found something."`

			`	Instead of the usual crowded spaceport, your ship is directed towards a small military outpost near the mountain range. There isn't much on the surface, but you notice a large bunker door built into the monuntain side. Greeting you on the landing pad are Orrs, Kesiner, and Peon.`
			`	Before you can say hello, Orrs, signals you to be quiet and heads inside. Kesiner and Peon follow suit. You look around a bit, just to see if there is anything sketchy going on, then head in.`
			`	Inside the bunker, after taking a long and silent elevator ride, the four of you finally stop. You are now in a conference room, with about a hundred people going through documents, watching videos, discussing in whispers... None of them looks up when you walked in.`
			`	One man finally stands up and speaks up, "Mr. Orrs, Major Kesiner, Representative Peon and Captain <last>, now that you are here, our meeting can start now. I am Admiral Maladrax. Although everyone here has been briefed about the situation, I would like you four to speak about your personal account of the incident again."`
			choice
				`	"Of course. It's not something that I would forget easily."`
				`	"Shouldn't we be out there looking for answer?"`
			`	"Thank you." Maladrax replies coldly.`
			`	After all four of you revisit that terrible incident, Maladrax points at the large screen on the wall. "Republic's Carrier in Alderamin, Syndicate's Bulk Freighter in Ruchbah, Deep's Bactrian in Adhara, Free Worlds' Bastion in Rastaban. All four vessels exited hyperspace in system with no crew. We were lucky enough to retrieve two data chips from four of them. The bastion is destroyed by local missile defense system and the bulk freighter crashed onto Crossroads."`
			`	He turns toward a group of about two dozens people who were going through the documents, "These are our top scientists. They are experts in fields ranging from hyperspace technology to to viral infection to human behavior. Basically anything that could caused this, there is at least one of them who know something about it."` He points to the people who were staring at computer screens, "These technicians are going through the recovered data chips to see if the ships' scanner pick up any anomaly."`
			`	Maladrax turns to you and ask, "Captain <last>, I know your allegiance was with the Free Worlds during the conflict, but now, we need to unite against this unknown threat."`
			choice
				`	"I understand. Give me an order and consider it done."`
				`	"It's all buddy buddy now, huh? Let's here it! What do you want me to do?"`
			`	Before the admiral can reply, a man runs in and yells, "Leviathan!... A Leviathan has been reported..."`
			`	Maladrax calmly replies, "Lieutenant Nemros, take a breath. Where is this Leviathan?"`
			`	The lieutenant shakingly shoves a technician aside, types in something onto the monitor, then points at the screen, where the video of a Merchant's Leviathan is being shown. "It exited hyperspace ten minutes ago in Sol system. No respond to any contact."`
			`	Maladrax stares at the screen for a good minute then say, "Captain <last>, we can't scramble our fleet in response to just one ship. Your mission is to board that ship, search for any survivor, and capture it."`
			choice
				`	"Is there anything else?"`
				`	"Fine."`
			`	Before Maladrax can dismiss you, Lieutenant Nemros jumps in, "Sir, I would like to accompany captain <last> on this mission."`
			`	Maladrax takes a quick look at the lieutenant then nods his head.`
			`	Nemros turns to you and says, "I will get ready immediately. When you are ready to leave, stop by the spaceport."`
