	description "The beam laser developed many years ago by the Deep actually had its origins in mining, as the first human settlers needed a way to access essential resources without depending on transports from Earth. With a wealth of such minerals surrounding them in the form of asteroids, the mining laser was one of the first technological wonders they reputedly developed and perfected. It is mundane compared to the beam weapons that have been developed since (and useless in combat against a modern, shielded enemy), but most beam weapons in human space owe their origins to the humble mining laser."

	description "Thunderheads are built around this stocky beam unit. The Lance is a simple laser; nothing more, nothing less. It is a very highly charged weapon, but it is effective only at short range.  Therefor the best way to use a Lance is to almost ram the ship in question."
