			`You find yourself walking down a dark alleyway on the way to an underground bar that sells some of your favorite exotic drinks.`
			`	You are nearing your destination when you see a striking woman walking towards you. Assuming she's just a normal individual, you are about to turn the corner when she stops you.`
			`	"Hi there!" She says quite cheerily. "My name is Catherine! If I'm correct, you're Captain <first>."`
			choice
				`	"I am. How do you know that?"`
				`	"I am, but how do you know my name?"`
			`	"Well, not only does my organization know quite a bit about your life, you're also one of the most well known people in the galaxy. What with you repelling those 'Pug'."`
			`	You open your mouth to speak, but she stops you. "You were going to ask about my "organization" right? Well, I'm a part of the Unity Movement. We work to... remove destabilizing factors in the galaxy."`
			`	She grins a bit before continuing. "This is a little bit embarrasing, but you and your Free Worlds friends were once one of those factors. I guess it's good you weren't removed."`
			choice
				`	"I can agree with that."`
					goto agree
				`	"Being "removed" doesnt sound very fun at all."`
			`	"It wouldn't have been. The resolution to the war came at a good time for you" she replies.`

			`	"Anyways, we're getting off topic here. Or movement needs your help. However, I cannot tell you more until you agree to help us."`
			choice
				`	"You're not giving me an awful lot to go off here, but I guess I'll help you."`
					goto help
				
				`	"I'm sorry, but I'm not convinced. I'm not just going to join some organization without knowing anything about it."`
				
			`	"Well that's to bad. I guess there's nothing left to talk about." She leaves you standing in the alleyway. Unable to remember why you came down here in the first place, you return to your ship.`
