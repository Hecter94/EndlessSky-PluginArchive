			`You find yourself walking down a dark alleyway on the way to an underground bar that sells some of your favorite exotic drinks.`

			`	You are about to turn the corner when the figure steps in front of you, blocking your path. You can't see his face. "Captain <last>."`

			`	You open your mouth to speak, but he stops you. "Let me stop you. You were going to inquire about my agency? We are known to most as the Chaos Insurgency. We live to free the common people from their opressors."`
