# Amphibious-Ships

 This is a plugin for Endless Sky adding a T3-ish race whose ships and weapons are inspired by modern day naval ships. The ships added range from pesky missile boats all the way to super battleships and heavy carriers, with powerful fighters to compliment them.
Currently the plugin features:
- 35 new systems
- 24 new ships: 10 Warships, 3 Dedicated Carriers, 6 Logistical Ships (1 of which has a special variant), 2 Outriggers (with 5 uniquely sprited and statted variants each), 2 Fighters, and 1 Drone.
- 19 new weapons
- A new engine set (6 thrusters, 6 steerings)
- 27 unique outfits
- A powerful new foe in the form of Quarg Automata
