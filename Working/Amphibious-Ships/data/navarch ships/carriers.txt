	description "The Navarchs specialize in sea-to-space ship designs, and the mighty Regnum is a premiere feature of that ideology. A massive carrier, modest in armament, but encased in ultra-heavy shields with a heavy duty hull. With its payload of 46 fighters on tap, it's an impressive ship by all measures."

	description `The mighty Regio-class carrier is a sight to behold, either on the seas or among the stars. While it does show its age with a lack of Phase Torpedo tubes, refits over generations mean many of these ships use state-of-the-art shield and hull technologies, resulting in a ship that not only has a payload of nearly 100 fighters, but also is practically unkillable in the face of all but the largest of co-ordinated strikes.`

	description `The Parvregalimen is a hybrid freighter-carrier, designed as a solo mining vessel in contrast to the cludgey nature of supplementing Regnum-class carriers with Imperiums. Though its payload isn't quite as large as a Regnum, the Parvregalimen has a very large amount of cargo space, allowing it to be a reliable drop-off point for mining fighters.`

	description `This experimental augmentation to the Dominium lightens its cargo load significantly, but allows it to shepard dozens of Subforma drones around space, essentially converting the ship into a stealth carrier. The addition of the Navarchs' experimental Shock Blasters allows the ship to suppress enemies from a distance as the drones tear them apart.`

	description `To command a Supravitae is the highest honor a Navarch can achieve; and serving aboard one isn't very farm behind. The Supravitae has a more formidable armament than any other Navarch ship, and support for a whopping 76 fighters, putting it between the Regnum and Regio in terms of fighter payload. Also aboard are some more logistical facilities, such as a notably sized cargo bay, and a large amount of spare bunks for reserve crew or ground troops.`
	description `	Of course, the Supravitae is not an easy ship to build or obtain; purchasing one will almost certainly leave a significant dent in any captain's budget for a long time.`
