	description `An "Outrigger" refers both to a secondary hull attached to a ship as well as the ship itself capable of accepting such attachments. The smallest of the Navarchs' outrigger vessels, the Infrafamilia by itself is the smallest, lightest ship in the Navarch fleet, effectively mimicking the role of a Shuttle. Despite this, it is still a full-sized warship, with a decent armament allowing it to tangle with other small vessels and fighters.`
	description `	Outriggers are an aging technology in Navarch space, largely held afloat by pre-existing supply and infrastructure. Though most planetary settlements lack the correct equipment to properly interchange outriggers; instead, loaded variants of the ship must be found aboard space stations, where the interchange infrastructure is much simpler and easier to run.`

	description `With a minelayer outrigger, the Infrafamilia becomes a rather capable patrol boat, able to saturate an area with mines while being able to take more punishment than the Tribus. Additional anti-missile turrets also allow it to more effectively sweep for mines as well, and thus the minelayer outrigger - despite its age - is the most popular configuration of the Infrafamilia.`

	description `This variant of the Infrafamilia has an outrigger designed for long-ranged missile barrages using Ransacker launch systems. Installing the launchers partially below deck cut into the overall outfit space, but the Outrigger provides overall greater weapon capacity, and thus is popular with Navarchs concerned over burst firepower rather than sustainability or maneuverability.`

	description `A larger Outrigger, dating back to the Navarchs' transition from versatile, modular outriggers to dedicated ship designs about 35,000 years ago. The design has seen some refits to keep up with the latest technology, but is only configurable at larger Navarch stations due to the unwieldly length of the ship mixed with its three outrigger attachment points.`
	description `	By itself, however, the Subsectio has its own merits, essentially being a lighter armed but more durable and nimble Ordo. As such, some Navarchs use the "empty" configuration as a light screening destroyer, at least until they can reliably afford the slightly more expensive (and far less durable) Ordo.`

	description `The least popular Subsectio variant, largely due to the fact that its minelayers mean it must get close for it to make an appreciable difference in combat. Still, for captains looking to haul a bit more loot while still being able to lay down a screen of mines, this configuration has that sort of mix on lockdown.`
