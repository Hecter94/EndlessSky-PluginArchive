	description `The Subforma is a stealth combat drone developed by the Navarchs; effectively just a standardized cargo container converted into a compact, stackable drone, Subformae rely on their carrier to recharge their shields, insteady relying on their dense hull and newly-developed rearmoring tech to keep the drone functional. Subformae carry anti-capital weapons, allowing a swarm to quickly rip a large target apart should their carrier's on-board armament be insufficient.`

	description `Building on techniques learned during the construction of the Subvarietas, the Forma-class fighter is designed as a deployable anti-missile net, allowing any fleet to rapidly extend its field of missile denial. The design does have some drawbacks, however, such as the reduced engine capacity and hampered outfit space, meaning the ship is only used in its dedicated anti-missile role.`

	description `With their fighters being deployed in such significant numbers with the expectation of casualties, the Navarchs invested heavily in advanced automaton designs. The resultant fighters, known as the Subvarietas, are practically miniature warships, able to soak up an absurd amount of damage while doling out both anti-capital and anti-fighter fire.`
	description `	It's actually quite impressive how highly engineered these ships are; armor is strategically placed around every outfit compartment, reducing both the space and mass the armor takes up while providing maximum protection.`

	description "The Tribus is a minelaying destroyer used by the Navarchs to saturate a system in lathe mins; though one Tribus is already capable of outputting a significant quantity of mines, they Tribus' relatively small size and low cost means they are frequently fielded in sorties of 3 or more."

	description `Compared to its sister ship, the Subfamilia is specialized for long-ranged missile combat rather than minelaying. In addition to 10 launch bays for Ransacker Missile swarms, the ship features a Monolithic Anti-Missile as one of its "main guns", allowing it to sweep mines and block missiles from enormous distances as it bombards the opposition from long range.`

	description `With its heavy armament of Phase Torpedoes, the Genus is a fearsome ranged combatant capable of doing highly accurate damage over great range. Its role as a dreaded capital hunter has lead to a popular folktale about a sortie of Genera sinking an entire Quarg patrol before the Quarg's intrasystem scanners even had a lock on them.`

	description "A relic of an earlier age, the Familia-class missile cruiser has largely been supplanted by its smaller brother, the Subfamilia, in service. However, the Familia is still a long-ranged powerhouse, with its huge battery of Ransacker launchers and a pair of 7-62 batteries to shore up against more pinpoint targets. Additionally, the shield matrix is especially robust, adding noticeable amounts of durability (and weight) to an already difficult to hunt ship."

	description "The Ordo is a middleweight cruiser fielded by the Navarchs, designed to provide an effective anti-fighter platform while still retaining some long-range, anti-capital capability as well. To this end, it has only 3 main guns of reduced size, providing it with the ability to provide long-ranged support between fending off fighter sorties."

	description `The Infracohors is a prototype "mini-battleship" designed as a testbed for the Navarchs' Shock Blaster turrets. The principle behind the design is that, by removing a need for barbettes, a ship can carry more armor and equipment in a similar space. The resultant ship is thus more mobile, tougher, and still capable of long-ranged attacks.`

	description `The Phylum is an experimental battleship featuring a number of new and exciting technologies by the Navarchs; most notably, their new beam weapon, the THEL. Armed for heavy anti-capital duty, the Phylum is a fearsome ship to engage, however a reduced amount of deck space compared to the tried and true Divisio means that the ships tend to fare well in different conditions, rather than one being overwhelmingly favourable compared to the other.`

	description `The Regalis Super Battleship is a sight to behold. Featuring 6 barbettes carrying some of the largest turrets the Navarchs have ever designed, it is capable of annihilating most ships with a single blast from its main battery. However, the ship is also coated in anti-missile and anti-fighter turrets, with powerful Phase Torpedoes to strike distant foes. Perhaps expectedly, the ship's only major weakness is its speed.`

	description `Navarch society's vision of luxury rarely matches up with that of humanity's; particularly in the way that a "lavish" lifestyle in Navarch society is often described as serving aboard a large, powerful vessel, rather than spending most of their golden years on a rich planet surrounded by other rich folks. However, there is a subset of Navarch culture that doesn't mind a bit of extra comfort, and many of them end up travelling aboard ships like the Microphylum.`
	description `	While the conditions aboard the ship aren't "luxurious" by most species' standards, the beds are at least big enough for any Navarch of reasonable size to comfortably sleep in, and there's more interesting food aboard than the taffylike rations Navarch crew often subsist off of.`

	description `The Imperium-class Auxiliary makes the Republic Navy's own auxiliary look pitiful in comparison; carrying a formidable main battery in its own right with nearly triple the capacity of its smaller sibling on all fronts, the Imperium is a staple of large Navarch fleets.`

	description `The Dominium is a large-scale freighter that entered Navarch space quite recently, dating back about half a millenium. Over the course of its short life, it has seen massive popularity in the Navarchs' shipping sectors, able to carry an enormous amount of cargo wherever its needed. It is quite the sluggish ship, but Navarch captains are no stranger to bulky, slow ships.`
