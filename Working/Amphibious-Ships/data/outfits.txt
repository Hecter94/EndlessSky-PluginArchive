	description "When the Navarchs needed a shield generator for their largest ships, they sought to make a shield generator that would be able to level the playing field with any alien armada. This shield generator is so powerful that the shield often leaks into the hull, effectively replacing lost surface hull until a more permanent fix can be implemented."

	description `Experimental Navarch vessels rely primarily on their cutting-edge armor rather than shield matricies. These odd "hull reactors" contain loops that allow them to circulate a gel that solidifies and crystallizes into this new armor when exposed to open space, allowing a ship to repair itself at great speed. The system takes a constant supply of energy to fabricate and circulate replacement fluid, but as a consequence, requires very little active energy when the hull is damaged.`
