Besides that, it is also a super-ocean world, with a surface area nearly 6 times larger than Earth, nearly 98% of which is water. As such, it serves as the perfect staging ground for the Navarchs' massive warfleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport sprawls all over and around a lone continent around the size of south america; large ships wait at port around the coast, with several channels reserved for ships coming in for landing. Each dock here could hold 5-6 human ships of any size."

As such, it is quite busy here, despite the relative inelegance of Navarch stations compared to their terrestrial worlds."
	spaceport "The station is almost entirely spaceport, with artificial gravity being the only thing from keeping cargo and personnel from tumbling off the platforms. Numerous small tug drones work to expediently guide interchanging outriggers between ships, and a few Navarchs can be seen taking pictures of the bright trails left behind by the small nanoplasma thrusters the tugs use."

Beaufort's value comes from the presence of yottrite in its home system, which the Navarchs use in their ships and weapons."
	spaceport "Beaufort's spaceport seems to have been formed of molten metal slag like much of the rest of its surface, with natural outcrops serving as docking bays. Though the planet's surface is surprisingly temperate and has enough gravity to hold the water channels in place, it has no noticeable atmosphere."

As such, all ships staioned here are above a certain size, to avoid damage incurred by the showers.`
	spaceport "The spacport here consists only of large docks, and are heavily reinforced; in fact, you aren't walking along the metal structure at all, but instead shields over 2 feet thick.

	description "Beneath a thick layer of fog lies a planet with a vibrant rest-hued ocean, coloured so because of the absurdly high iron content of the water. Navarch ships here have to land with shields fully enabled to avoid iron particulate clinging to the exterior of their hulls. The iron here is, in fact, so infused into the water, that occasionally large enough storm clouds will have the mineral content necessary to rain iron as if it were clean water, requiring all of the ships and buildings here to run their shields all the time to avoid being petrified like the few small species of tree native to the islands."
	spaceport `The spaceport is encased in a large, domular shield that protects it from the "rust rain". Despite this, there is a rather robust shipyard located here, taking advantage of the practically limitless sources of raw materials in the waters and small islands around the spaceport.`

	spaceport "The spaceport has two layers, one for above-water interactions typical of Navarch fleets, but a second, subaquatic layer make of what looks to be reinforced glass, serving submarine-like vehicles as they dive deep into the oceans to investigate the turbulent zones where water and the gas core mix."

The population here exceeds 100 billion individuals, and the planet is remarkably self-sufficient compared to similarly urban human worlds."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is designed mostly for cargo and logistical ships rather than warships, so capital warships are typically serviced by intraplanetary shuttlecraft that use the deck space on such warships as landing pads. Despite this, orders are conducted with surprising efficiency, with many ships hosting shuttles even before they've come to rest in the water."

However, Cantabri is one of the few worlds reserved for the elite who doesn't want to spend their whole life aboard a cruising vessel. The planet's seas are a rich blue, and are calm enough that you can see your reflection in them. The Navarchs here are a slightly uppity sort compared to most you've met, but the mood here is overall pleasant and tranquil."
	spaceport `The spaceport is built in a specifically reserved sect of ocean, leaving the rest of the waters placid for the locals to enjoy. The market here deals in lots of luxury goods, and most Navarchs here seem to be of a significantly different caste than the hard-working naval crews or the diligent researchers, and most attempt to stop you to tell you stories of their "past lives" as one of such roles.`

As such, permanent settlements are a rarity here, with most livingspaces just being retired military ships (some of which are old enough that they are no longer sold in Navarch space).`
	spaceport `The "spaceport" is essentially just a Supravitae that has had most of its weapons stripped off in favour of marketplaces and communications equipment, co-ordinating the thousands of independent houseboats on-world. Some free-floating raftlike boats exist to serve trade between fleets, driven by smaller versions of the nanoplasma engines used on ships.`

	description "Tyrrhen is a research world focused on developing post-scarcity sources of energy and materials. Rumour has it that, behind closed doors, there are prototype cells capable of scrubbing the cosmic microwave background for energy."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is fairly secluded, hosting a few small research fleets at a time. Contrary to most of Navarch space, where crews commonly sing shanties or converse while they work, the crews here are fairly quiet, keeping talk largely to just business."

planet Venetioon
	landscape land/ocean1-turbulent
	description "Venetioon is a temperate ocean world, home to frequent rain, but very little storms. The water here is exceptionally soft, so many Navarchs come here for recreation. There's some industry here, but it's largely administrative and bureaucratic, leading to a surprisingly quiet world."
	spaceport "The spaceport is fairly calm, though many Navarch tourists end up pulling you into photos, with or without your permission. The mood of the spaceport is jovial, with work crews loading at a very lax pace compared to more heavily regulated worlds."

planet "Porwant Station"
	attributes "navarch industrial"
	description "Porwant Station is one of the few places in Navarch space where the equipment for properly processing yottrite can be found, and the resultant resources produced are shipped to all corners of Navarch space."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is fairly sparse, and this is one of the stations incapable of interchanging outriggers. As such, save for small fleets coming to pick up allotments of yottrite-derived materials, the spaceport is rather quiet."

planet Venif
	attributes "navarch capital" "navarch industrial"
	landscape land/island1
	description "Venif is a super-ocean world, rich not in resources, but space and tranquil waters. Many industries, both labor and bureaucratic, have been set up here, and over the course of time the planet has become one of the few places where all the stars have aligned to allow for Supravitae construction."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is a marvel of automated engineering, with thousands of workers working smoothly with machines to assemble Supravitaes for use in Navarch warfleets. It is for this reason alone that Venif's spaceport is so huge; pristine Supravitaes lining the docks, awaiting their new captains and crews."

	landscape land/island1
	description "Kvarken is a luscious tropical world, and is home to a thriving forestry industry. The Navarchs do not use much wood in their constructions, but it is valued for its carbon content, ease of transport, and renewability."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is a healthy mix of large-scale industry and small-scale independent hobby shops; some Navarchs enjoy hunting the exotic and often dangerous wildlife here, and several market stall owners offer you a chance to try exotic meat and fish prepared in equally exotic ways."

	attributes "navarch mercantile"
	landscape land/oceancity3
	description "Vainas is a small shipping world, often acting as a reserve for supplies either exported from or needed on Kvarken. As such, the planet is generally quiet, and hosts a modest population of around ten billion Navarchs."
	spaceport "The spaceport is fairly small and lax, at least by Navarch standards; ships still regularly land and take off, but it's rare that any of the largest Navarch ships end up here for long."

	description "Curoni is one of the few planets that hosts outrigger exhcanges, featuring a vast array of lifts and chambers to rapidly cycle through existing stock."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a fairly active place, hosting a healthy mix of backline vessels; mostly outriggers, but many missile boats as well. Some Navarchs are even making deals to exchange ships."
