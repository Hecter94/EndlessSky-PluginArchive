planet "Porwant Station"
	description "Porwant Station is one of the few places in Navarch space where the equipment for properly processing yottrite can be found, and the resultant resources produced are shipped to all corners of Navarch space."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is fairly sparse, and this is one of the stations incapable of interchanging outriggers. As such, save for small fleets coming to pick up allotments of yottrite-derived materials, the spaceport is rather quiet."

planet Venif
	description "Venif is a super-ocean world, rich not in resources, but space and tranquil waters. Many industries, both labor and bureaucratic, have been set up here, and over the course of time the planet has become one of the few places where all the stars have aligned to allow for Supravitae construction."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is a marvel of automated engineering, with thousands of workers working smoothly with machines to assemble Supravitaes for use in Navarch warfleets. It is for this reason alone that Venif's spaceport is so huge; pristine Supravitaes lining the docks, awaiting their new captains and crews."
