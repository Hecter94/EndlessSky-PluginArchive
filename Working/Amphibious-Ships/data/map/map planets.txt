planet Gulfosala

	description "This is one of the few worlds with enough notable landmass for the Navarchs to have built landbound ship facilities. Besides that, it is also a super-ocean world, with a surface area nearly 6 times larger than Earth, nearly 98% of which is water. As such, it serves as the perfect staging ground for the Navarchs' massive warfleets."
	spaceport "The spaceport sprawls all over and around a lone continent around the size of south america; large ships wait at port around the coast, with several channels reserved for ships coming in for landing. Each dock here could hold 5-6 human ships of any size."

As such, it is quite busy here, despite the relative inelegance of Navarch stations compared to their terrestrial worlds."
	spaceport "The station is almost entirely spaceport, with artificial gravity being the only thing from keeping cargo and personnel from tumbling off the platforms. Numerous small tug drones work to expediently guide interchanging outriggers between ships, and a few Navarchs can be seen taking pictures of the bright trails left behind by the small nanoplasma thrusters the tugs use."

	spaceport `The spaceport here is entirely seabound, with large "runways" for ships to land on the water. As expected, the scope is truly massive; each dock here is roughly six times the size of the largest human space docks.`

	description "Pechora is an ice world, but plays home to some crucial material refineries; as such, large channels of water have been carved out of the multiple-kilomter-thick ice sheets that evenly obscure the true surface of the planet, with small ships patrolling and using small heat rays to ensure the channels don't refreeze."

Beaufort's value comes from the presence of yottrite in its home system, which the Navarchs use in their ships and weapons."
	spaceport "Beaufort's spaceport seems to have been formed of molten metal slag like much of the rest of its surface, with natural outcrops serving as docking bays. Though the planet's surface is surprisingly temperate and has enough gravity to hold the water channels in place, it has no noticeable atmosphere."

As such, all ships staioned here are above a certain size, to avoid damage incurred by the showers.`
	spaceport "The spacport here consists only of large docks, and are heavily reinforced; in fact, you aren't walking along the metal structure at all, but instead shields over 2 feet thick. Meteoroids of various sizes are littered throughout the spaceport's scaffoldlike walkways, and there always seems to be some part under repair."

planet Gomerce
	landscape land/oceanfog2
	description "Beneath a thick layer of fog lies a planet with a vibrant rest-hued ocean, coloured so because of the absurdly high iron content of the water. Navarch ships here have to land with shields fully enabled to avoid iron particulate clinging to the exterior of their hulls. The iron here is, in fact, so infused into the water, that occasionally large enough storm clouds will have the mineral content necessary to rain iron as if it were clean water, requiring all of the ships and buildings here to run their shields all the time to avoid being petrified like the few small species of tree native to the islands."
	spaceport `The spaceport is encased in a large, domular shield that protects it from the "rust rain". Despite this, there is a rather robust shipyard located here, taking advantage of the practically limitless sources of raw materials in the waters and small islands around the spaceport.`

	spaceport "The spaceport has two layers, one for above-water interactions typical of Navarch fleets, but a second, subaquatic layer make of what looks to be reinforced glass, serving submarine-like vehicles as they dive deep into the oceans to investigate the turbulent zones where water and the gas core mix."

	spaceport `Unlike other Navarch Stations, there is a suprising amount of non-dock station here, with vast interior spaces used for mineral processing and storage.

The population here exceeds 100 billion individuals, and the planet is remarkably self-sufficient compared to similarly urban human worlds."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is designed mostly for cargo and logistical ships rather than warships, so capital warships are typically serviced by intraplanetary shuttlecraft that use the deck space on such warships as landing pads. Despite this, orders are conducted with surprising efficiency, with many ships hosting shuttles even before they've come to rest in the water."

	description "A snow world, Blihano is valued for the pelts of its native creatures, which are used to make exotic textiles. Hunting here is carefully regulated to ensure the species here aren't overhunted. Despite this, it remains a popular sporting world, and a spaceport in a small, artificial ocean a few hundred miles in any direction serves most of the planet."
	spaceport "The spaceport is confined to a small ocean kept artificially melted by ships with special heat rays. Small boats trawl the surface, blasting ice back into a liquid form. The residents here have many stories about ships being damaged by the ice refreezing."

planet Byscay
	landscape land/oceanfog1
	description "Byscay is an ocean world buried under thick fog. Apparently, it was one of the first worlds the Navarchs settled post-exile, contributing to why all Navarch ships have overly powerful two-way telemetry transmitters."
	spaceport "Hidden in the fog is the spaceport, where conditions are nearly white-out. You can't comfortably see from one side of a dock to another, and it seems the locals don't fare much better, as powerful spotlights are a feature every few yards. The locals here all have loud conversations as they work, presumably to give eachother ample notice of their location."

However, Cantabri is one of the few worlds reserved for the elite who doesn't want to spend their whole life aboard a cruising vessel. The planet's seas are a rich blue, and are calm enough that you can see your reflection in them. The Navarchs here are a slightly uppity sort compared to most you've met, but the mood here is overall pleasant and tranquil."
	spaceport `The spaceport is built in a specifically reserved sect of ocean, leaving the rest of the waters placid for the locals to enjoy. The market here deals in lots of luxury goods, and most Navarchs here seem to be of a significantly different caste than the hard-working naval crews or the diligent researchers, and most attempt to stop you to tell you stories of their "past lives" as one of such roles.`

As such, permanent settlements are a rarity here, with most livingspaces just being retired military ships (some of which are old enough that they are no longer sold in Navarch space).`
	spaceport `The "spaceport" is essentially just a Supravitae that has had most of its weapons stripped off in favour of marketplaces and communications equipment, co-ordinating the thousands of independent houseboats on-world. Some free-floating raftlike boats exist to serve trade between fleets, driven by smaller versions of the nanoplasma engines used on ships.`

	spaceport "Seanor's spaceport is a ringworld-esque docking structure, constructed in the twilight zone between the sun-facing and dark sides of the planet.

The native species here are mostly flighted creatures, the smallest of which is still about 5 feet tall when full grown. As such, hunting is a popular sport here."

planet Iroise
	landscape land/fields18
	description "This world's water is largely in the form of large lakes, and thus the Navarch presence here is somewhat limited. However, it is a very productive farming world, producing feed for farm animals across a fair portion of Navarch space. Because of this, Iroise's limited shipyard space is reserved entirely for logistical ships."
	spaceport `The spaceports are built across a few great lakes, most of which are only just deep enough for an Imperium to safely touch down in without major complications. As such the "diving lanes" are tightly regulated, ships being shuttled in and out of port very quickly to make the most of the limited deep water available.`

planet Shearis

Additionally, Cagliari supplies some exotic materials to research systems nearby, earning it a fair pay in the open market. It is for this reason that the Navarchs widely refer to this planet as their "home away from home", despite the fact that the planet doesn't even have a proper shipyard; just a basic station for supplying and outfitting logistical vessels.`
	spaceport "The spaceport here is constructed around long fjords, where logistical ships can come to a low cruising speed and still be serviced by the time they reach the opening at the other end of the fjords the supply depots are built around.
