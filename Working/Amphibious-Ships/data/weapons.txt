	description `True to its name, this weapon works in a similar method to a commonplace hyperdrive; it uses a large quantity of deuterium to produce a large explosion. However, instead of tucking it into a safe region of spacetime to accelerate the ship, the device warps the explosion a good distance in front of the firing ship, causing a devastating explosion. According to Navarch legend, this was the weapon that caused the Drak and Quarg to seal the Navarchs away.`
	description `	Somehow, the Navarchs have found a way to program the explosion in a way that it doesn't harm allied ships, meaning that, for a weapon of mass destruction, it's surprisingly safe to use.`
