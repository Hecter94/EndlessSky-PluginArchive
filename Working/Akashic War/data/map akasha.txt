	spaceport `The spaceport is located in what you presume to be the largest settlement, which has half a dozen impressivly high silos used to store offworld supplies and food. Fast, light aircrafts then distribuite them to the rest of the planet, presumably to other storage facilities.`

	description `	Although the station doesn't have any proper shipyard, there are sections of the station where a large number of warships are parked, ready to leave as needed.`
	spaceport `Most quarters are sealed off to civilians, and the only sections you are allowed to visit are the the trading hub and the refuelling station. There, an Akashic takes a quick look at your fuel port, and takes out of a cabinet a connector that fits your ship's.`

All but the largest Akashic ships are constructed here, using both the materials brought here by the merchant convoys and the ones mined from this system's asteroids.`
	description `	The huge ring around the station serves mostly as a housing for the soldiers assigned here, with apartments and services adequate for about a thousand individuals.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located in a small part of the station, a little above the main ring. There, long and brightly coloured docking arms grab any civilian ship approaching the station, and gently brings it towards the designated landing pad. The whole process doesn't take more than a couple minutes, but the traffic is so high that some docking arms are always active, leading to the need of a frequent mantainance to the arms' joints.`

In the case the Sankrit begins raiding their worlds, the Akashic will move the civilian population who lives in the southernmost planets to Karieli, at a much safer distance from the conflict.`
	spaceport `While the flats and skyscrapers reach impressive heights, you can't help but feel weird knowing that most of the buildings you see are completely empty, waiting for the war with the Sankrit to begin.`

	description `Kassandra is a cold world, only barely habitable for Akashic standards. Probably, it never would have been settled if it didn't have rich reserves of rare minerals, necessary for the Jump Drive construction. Most of the incoming ships are freighters, to transport the raw materials mined here, but an increasing amount of traffic is due to the Akashic warships patrolling the planet, in order to defend it from an eventual Sankrit attack.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is very small and crowded, with aircrafts continously going back and forth from the mines with a full cargo hold. Most warships don't land for more than a couple minutes, landing in the depleted quarries near the spaceport and refuelling their tanks before departing again.`

The system is far enough from Sankrit space to be unreachable with Jump Drives, probably so that the Quarg can keep an eye on the Sankrit activities while still staying at a safe distance from them.`
	spaceport `Billions of Quarg may be living here, but the spaceport is much more quiet than you would expect. Although there is some background noise, most of it is coming from the occasional conversations between the Akashic on the station.`
