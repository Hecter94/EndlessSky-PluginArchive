In this plugin, you get involved into discoveries of the origins of ancient settlements on Mars.


In chapter 1 you basically discover the Marsian Home in Maron System which receives two hyperspace links without further story explanation. I.e. you dont need a Jump Drive but instead can eventually do this mission already very early. Even as early as january 3014 - personally tested it while doing asteroid mining with a new pilot.
After you transfer a large scale expedition team to Marsian Home a series of technological discoveries is triggered which happen within a few years.
These include ancient large scale freighters (Freightliner/Megaliner series; Metroliner/Metropolis series; Freight Cube [Ultra/Ultimate] series), warships (Cruiser/Carrier series; Tactical Cubes series) as well es new designs (Courier transport and freighter series) based on the modular hull design concept of the ancestors.


In chapter 2 you lead the expedition to a nearby located ship wreckage of the ancestors. The main intention of this chapter is to give you some hints on the history. This is achieved by studying the ancient wreckage and eventually finding more ancient relicts in human space (may be recovering some data files on Mars?).
Because of the constant threats by the Korath exiles the researchers want the player to help them either reactivate the wreckage and bring it back to Maron system or to build a new Metropolis ship (or other competitive ship) which shall defend Maron system against any agressors.

In the middle of this chapter still everything is open. Possible storylines (numbered; ** separate sub plots):

1. The ancestors fled to a different galaxy with their Metropolis ships after being attacked by massive cube ships. This becomes the origin of the Wanderer species which they just have forgotten about.
** In a different galaxy (or part of this galaxy) they live amongst a young pre spaceflight species and teach them their knowledge about terraforming. They deceased over time and this influences the Wanderer (as "...they hate to make new friends only to lose them again.")
** Having lost all settlements and historic places when leaving their home world(s), they learned to start over and evolved to the current Wanderer species.
(since the human species didnt exist at that time yet, they cant know any of the human languages)
** The Pug protected them in their new home against the cube ships who followed them there.
** The Deep River ship class was inspired by the Freightliner design. But due to the limited capabilites in the new region (or for some other practical reasons) they are much smaller than the Freightliners.

2. The attackers were a borg species which liked the cube design (as in Star Trek). The fact that the shipyard on Marsian Home has their blueprints available has various explanations:
** Originally the ancestors designed the small cubes - much smaller than the Metropolis ships. When the borg assimilated Marsian Home they created the larger versions. I.e. the large cubes were not designed by the ancestors! As the borg grew in power, the Drak intervened and destroyed them with two simulatinous super novae.
** The ancestors did never built any cube ships. The cubes were always the design of their enemies but they captured some of the smaller ones and deconstructed them while searching for weaknesses. In the end they were overrun by some cubes of the 2k series, i.e. cubes with 8 times the length of a 255 series cube and 500 times its mass.
** The ancestors never built any cube ships. Their enemies attacked the peaceful ancestors and overwhelmed them. They occupied Marsian Home and used the extremely large shipyard for their own purposes. I.e. the shipyard was already used by (at least) two different species and the researchers just didnt notice the different epoches when processing the data.

3. The cube ships were designed during the upcoming war / while defending against the agressor.
** They were designed but never build because they had to flee before starting construction.
** They were build in numbers but were still too weak to stand against the agressor.
** The agressors were the Drak who are responsible for the extinction of the ancestors. Since a few could escape into (some previous) Wanderer space or somewhere else where they met the Pug, this partly explains why the Pug hat the Drak and the Archons.
** The agressors were not the Drak but the Drak did not intervene in time but allowed them to destroy the ancestors before the Drak destroyed the agressor for doing so.
** The Drak did hide the Maron system for a long time cutting it off from hyperspace lanes because they felt shame upon failing to protect the ancestors.

4. The ancestors were amongst the first ones to manufacture Jump Drives. They did build them in an external facility as already said in the plot. That facility was later found / taken over by the Korath who thereby gained access to the Jump Drive technology. - That partly explains why the Korath never wanted to give up the jump drives.
Eventually even the Korath civil war originates in the battle / race / rivalty over the control of the jump drive facility.
** The Korath world ships were inspired by the Freightliner design. Eventually they found a few (wreckages?) near the Jump Drive facility.
** The Drak isolated Maron system from the northern territories to prevent the Korath from finding the ancient facilities and thereby gain access to even more ancient knowledge.

5. The Drak were not involved at all. Never.
** The ancestors chose themself to isolate Maron from hyperspace as a mean of protection.
** The ancestors invented the Jump Drives but never used Hyperdrives in that era because the technology to create hyperspace lanes was invented later and the Jump Drive is the older technology. Fixed links (and the far simpler Hyperdrives) were invented for efficiency, making interstellar travel safer and cheaper. - I.e. Maron was never connected to any other system until recently.

6. The ancestors were the Pug. After they fled from Marsian Home to another galaxy they became even stronger there.
** That explains their interest in the humans since the humans evolved right next to one of their former settlements (the one on Mars). The wormhole in Deneb system which opens during the main plot is opened once again, i.e. not for the first time. The ancestors closed it after escaping from this part of the galaxy when they lost Maron system.
** They intentionally let the researchers discover signs of the old settlement on Mars and created hyperspace links to Maron system.
**** They hoped to lead human society into a new peaceful era.
**** They felt like giving humans a slight advantage/boost in the upcoming conflict(s) with the Alphas because the Quarg (who officially interact with the humans) did not engage against the Alphas or the hostile Korath.
** The very different ancient ship classes found in the yard on Maron system already hint on the flexibility of the Pug. The currently visible Pug ships (in human and in wanderer space) represent a much newer ship class. Though being much smaller they seem sufficient for current demands here. In their home territory they still fly with (successors of) the Metropolis class and similar ships.


In chapter 3 you benefit from your boardings of the ancient wreckage. Over time (in Chapter 2), the researchers had been able to download more and more data from the ship and reactivate some of its system. This lead to new insights and discoveries. They located more remnants of the ancestors which will systematically visited and analysed.

In a side plot to chapter 2 or 3 you get a chance to bring a terraforming team of the Wanderers (1) to the terraformers on Rand and (2) to the paradise worlds and (3) to Marsian Home.
Depending on the further main plot of chapter 3 or 4 this cultural exchange may deepen the relationships between both species or even unveil historic relations.

In another side plot to chapter 2 or 3 you get multiple chances to invest money into shipyard and outfitter facilities on core worlds of various factions.
