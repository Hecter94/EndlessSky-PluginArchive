	description "This courier ship was inspired by the Star Queen transport but it is a completely new design created after discovery of Marsian technology."
	description "	It is not as luxurious as the old Star Queen but nearly as fast as a Flivver allowing it to escape almost every battle. Despite that it comes with all modern defense systems securing passengers and cargo even in the more dangerous systems."
	description "	Primary mission profiles: emergency evacuation, emergency supplies, express cargo and courier services. There is still enough space left to equip scanning equipment for almost any search and rescue mission in deep space."

	description "The catamaran is a typical masterpiece of a designer who spent too many years in the shipyards of the Syndicate. It's a somewhat ugly recombination of the cargo courier and the cargo freighter."
	description "	The designer simply put two payload sections from the cargo courier on the sides of the minimal engine module. The resulting catamaran is underpowered, heavy and obviously slow. Some of its weapons could be best considered as 'misplaced' and the duplication of all control systems including even the hyperdrive (!) does not make this ship super efficient at all. But it is still a considerably large cargo and passenger ferry. Much larger than any regular human freighter."
	description "	Primary mission profile: heavy cargo and shuttle services between mining and industrial areas."

	description "It may not look like, but this ship belongs to the courier class. The Racer is classified as transport but could as well be classified as medium warship in human space. In combat, it is similar to a Corvette or Firebird. But the Racer is three times faster, outrunning even the tiny Flivver transport ship. The speed has its price though."
	description "	This ship clearly targets embassadors, celebrities and executives. The interior is pretty luxurious and you dont hear the engines in the passenger area. The modern defense systems allow for a safe passage through dangerous systems."

	description "After the new MaFr Courier class rapidly gained popularity amongst the cruiseline enterprises the design team decided to put all the experience they gathered with these ships, including the learnings from the catamaran, and came up with this new heavy cruiseliner. It shall transport well paying tourists to risky regions with high pirate activity. Obviously, a ship full of rich tourists makes an attractive target for the pirates. But this cruiseliner has more internal weapon systems and stronger shields than a Navy Carrier!"
	description "	Extending the idea of the Catamaran, this ship uses three payload sections, arranged in a circular layout on top of the original engine module. This time, all main systems have been multiplied by purpose, including additional batteries. - None of the cruiseline enterprises wants their passengers to strand in dangerous systems."
	description "	Primary mission profile: tourism in dangerous areas."

	description "After the new MaFr Courier class rapidly gained popularity in the passenger transport area, the design team decided to put all the experience they gathered with these ships, including the learnings from the catamaran, and created this new bulk freighter using the same approach as with the cruiseliner."
	description "	This is the cleanest design modification after the original cargo courier ship. This ship is an excellent and efficient cargo freighter now. In terms of crew efficiency or cargo tonnage per crew member it can compete with any other human freighter."
	description "	The additional cargo modules come, again, with one anti missile turret each, allowing this ship to easily defend against any frigate and probably even against a Navy Cruiser!"
	description "	Primary mission profile: heavy cargo duties over long distances and in dangerous areas."
