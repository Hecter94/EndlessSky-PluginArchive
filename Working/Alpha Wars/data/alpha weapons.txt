	description "This is an energy blaster modified by the Alphas. It is benefitted by their increased intelligence when compared to ordinary humans however, since they do nat have access to the manufacturing facilities of Earth and the core worlds, which are heavily guarded for this very reason, they are unable to completely redesign them and must instead make do with the changes they can make with the materials and machinery they have to hand, fortunately for the rest of humanity."

	description "Gatling Gun Ammo is the ammunition for the Gatling Gun. It consists of specially created cartridges containing all the reactants necessary to propel the projectile while in the vacuum of Space. The projectile consists of depleted nuclear fuel, or an incendiary tracer round. Since this ammunition is primarily manufactured on pirate worlds by slave children in poor working conditions, muzzle velocity can vary by up to 30%, and tracer distribution is seldom uniform."
