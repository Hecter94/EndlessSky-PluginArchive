	description "The Aerie is a prototype design from the Deep. The engineers who worked on this ship decided they wanted to make a ship capable of carrying two fighters and a decent armament of it's own as efficiently as possible."
	description "Since the outbreak of war, work on the Aerie has been accelerated and so, while it may be able to wield a fairly impressive armament, it is unable to cool even the most basic of loadouts without additional cooling outfits."
