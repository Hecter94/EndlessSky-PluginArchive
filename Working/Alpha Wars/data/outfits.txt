	"ramscoop" .35
	description "Ramscoops are a staple of all ships due to how sparsely populated space is at the moment, it is prohibitively difficult to travel between the small clusters of inhabited systems without one because of the many hyperspace jumps between systems."
	description "Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
	description "	(As a safety measure, all ships are able to harvest tiny amounts of fuel by flying close to a star, but this outfit allows you to accumulate fuel much more quickly. The closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate.)"

	description "This is the standard shield generator for fighters and interceptors, as well as for many non-combat starships. Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

	"shield energy" .24
	description "This is a slightly more powerful shield generator than the standard model installed in most small ships. If combat lasts long enough, the increased recharge rate is enough to give you an edge, but recharging your shields completely will still take a long time."

	"mass" 80
	"outfit space" -80
	"shield generation" .655
	"shield energy" .9825
	description "This is the most powerful shield generator available in human space. Because of their large size, D94-YV shield generators are mostly used in large warships, but you can fit one in a smaller ship if you are willing to sacrifice engine power or weaponry to make space for it."

	description "Liquid helium is the ultimate in cooling technology. Given how much space this cooling system takes up, you may be better off just installing more efficient, low-heat components instead, but where that is not an option, this cooler can handle almost anything you throw at it."

	"afterburner fuel" 1
	"afterburner heat" 12
	"afterburner effect" "afterburner"
	description "An afterburner works by dumping hyperspace fuel into your engines and igniting it, producing a large amount of thrust. This can be very useful for dodging missiles or briefly escaping from faster opponents, but you must be careful to avoid using up so much fuel that you do not have enough left for hyperspace travel."

	"flare sound" "ion tiny"
	description "This is the smallest thruster that you can buy, so weak that anything larger than a drone will accelerate quite slowly when using this engine. On the other hand, it is also very energy-efficient."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

		"frame rate" 1.1
	"flare sound" "ion small"
	description "The X2700 ion thruster is intended mostly for use in small, single-person or two-person ships, as well as in fighters. It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."

	"flare sound" "ion medium"
	description "The X3700 ion thruster is designed for heavy freighters and small capital ships. In theory, it could be installed in smaller ships too, if they have enough engine space, to attain almost ridiculous speeds."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

		"frame rate" 0.9
	"flare sound" "ion large"
	description "The X4700 ion thruster was developed when the Republic Navy began building warships so large that the X3700 was not sufficient for them. It allows even a capital ship to move at a respectable speed."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

	"flare sprite" "effect/ion flare/huge"
		"frame rate" 0.8
	"flare sound" "ion huge"
	description "The X5700 thruster is intended for only the largest of capital ships. When the Syndicate first began producing them, these engines were considered little more than a publicity stunt, because no ship at the time was large enough to hold one."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

	description "This is the smallest set of steering thrusters that you can buy, generally considered suitable only for tiny, pilotless drones. Occasionally pilots looking for some extra outfit space will try swapping out their larger steering systems for one of these, but the results are invariably disappointing."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."

They work much like the railguns of ancient naval combat however they are loaded with a very small warhead and so they do more damage than a standard railgun but cannot fire at as high a rate. A Bolt Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has fired off all its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Bolts less useful in protracted battles. As a result, they are very popular with pirates as a way to quickly disable a small target."

Over a millennia (and hundreds of wars) later, the basic design is still used, a testament to its fundamentally robust design (and the inability of guns to prevent wars). While capable of a fairly quick rate of fire, this gun needs to cool down for twice as much time as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
