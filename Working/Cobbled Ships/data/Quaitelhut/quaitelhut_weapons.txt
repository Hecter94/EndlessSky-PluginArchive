	description "When the Quaitelhut were first starting out in space, they largely relied on small ships. As such, they needed small weapons; their first weapons were just that: Simple, small, projectile spewing weapons. These simple guns work by fashioning simple kinetic projectiles out of small pieces of scrap, then using linear induction to rapidly spray the produced projectiles towards an enemy target."
	description "The result is a cheap, effective weapon that, while wildly inaccurate, deals copious amounts of close-ranged damage. In light of more elegant and interesting weapons, this original projectile printer model was sadly left behind in light of more advanced weaponry."

	description "The Quaitelhut don't spend much time on working with their more standard-fare weaponry; they find such pursuits boring, and would prefer to turn their heads to more exotic technology. However, as a primary weapon, the Quaitelhut's Neutron Injector is a fearsome and brutal weapon."
	description "Despite its relatively small size, it is a high-powered particle gun that services well at all ranges, firing tight bundles of noble gases at extreme speeds. Though single shots alone aren't deadly, the gun fires quite quickly, and it is easy to amass a large salvo."

	description "For their capital ships, the Quaitelhut needed a powerful, intimidating, long-range weapon. The result is a triple-barreled artillery piece, designed to be mounted on large ships in the rear of the fleet."
	description "Building off of their Neutron Injector technology, the Stonk uses a heavy metal atom core that's coated in layers of hardlight as it passes through the barrel of the gun, building up into an inordinately heavy projectile by the end. This process, uses a lot of energy and generates a fair amount of heat."

	description "When the Quaitelhut first met the Moh Raii, they were astonished that the Moh Raii's relatively primitive guns were able to disrupt and tear holes in the durable shield matrices of the Quaitelhut's ships. A half century or so later, the Quaitelhut have developed quite the strange weapon."
	description "Though not as effective at disrupting shields as the Moh Raii's biological weaponry, the charged nature of the Phase Cannon projectiles also causes them to ionize and drain ships of their power, meaning a number of hits landing in succession can make it extremely difficult for a ship to fight back. This disabling nature, however, does render the weapon's traditional damage quite moot."

	description "When the Thermal Projector was created, the Quaitelhut could have never imagined it would be too efficient to be practical. Thus, a smaller, less effective version was created; a small beam weapon, outfitted with an equally small heat sink and pump."
	description "Though smaller than its projectile-spitting brother, the Thermal Beam still serves well in its purpose as a cooling weapon."

	description "The Quaitelhut naturally run their ships quite hot, as heat is comfortable to them. Even their ships are naturally resistant to heat. However, some clever Quaitelhut figured out that they could incorporate an electric heatsink into a weapon, allowing a ship to pump heat into heating coils, which can then be used to heat projectiles as they pass through."
	description "However, the gun has some drawbacks; the heatsinks save on weapon space as they can be installed a fair distance away from the gun, but they're almost too efficient, and a ship outfitted with too many might find that it's hard to keep up a consistent salvo."
