	description "The Techpriests commonly make use of bizarre, difficult-to-understand technology, but the Spacerender is by far their most complex weapon. It rips holes in space time, yielding vast quantities of seeking projectiles that intelligently bob and weave through obstacles to strike their target."
	description "The projectiles themselves seem to use a jamming-resistant form of radar to seek ships, though it's hard to tell exactly how the projectiles track by radar in the first place. The Techpriests refuse to delve into the secrets of such a weapon's creation."
