	description "When the Geocoris was first created, the Hai could have never imagined the sheer scale that human ships would grow to accomodate as time progressed. In response to the sizes human ships were reaching, the Hai developed the Termite Queen: A massive vessel, capable of storing thousands of tons of cargo, as well as boasting enough anti-missile to counter the attacks of a small fleet."
	description "Being a superfreighter, however, does mean the Termite Queen is a rather bulky, slow beast."
