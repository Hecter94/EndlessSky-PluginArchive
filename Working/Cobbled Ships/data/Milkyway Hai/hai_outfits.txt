	description "Though Hai technology is relatively stagnant and stable, some developments are made by those interested in pushing the limits of Hai technology. The Charged Matrix Projectile system is an interesting blend of energy and ammunition; CMP Generators like this one produce temporary ammunition from high amounts of energy which is then fired."
	description "CMPs work by creating a miniature shield matrix, then overcharging it so it's stable until long after it's fired. This has some unique effects: Though the CMP generators create significant amounts of heat, the projectiles act as heat sinks, absorbing heat to make them more volatile in open space. As such, the system overall produces less heat when firing."
	description "Though one generator can produce an endless stream of CMPs, there is a (rather generous) maximum throughput. This unit can support up to 3 CMP guns."

	description "The CMP Conduit works by amplifying the output of the host generator without consuming a massive amount of power, as well as providing an extra port and storage for produced CMPs."
	description "The ultimate result, however, is simple: Each conduit makes the overall CMP system more power-efficient, without increasing heat requirements by a ton."

	description "The CMP system is a remarkably complex system of weapon technology, but at the end of the day, the launcher portion is ultimately the end your enemies see. Though its rate of fire is quite sluggish, the fact that ammunition management is completely handed off to a separate system means that it can provide unparalleled power in the energy weapon space."
	description "Each launcher is designed to dump heat into the projectile to increase volatility, resulting in the weapon cooling its host ship as it fires. However, some energy is required to fire the weapon, so it's not a completely free method of cooling; nevermind the fact that the system overall runs net positive in terms of heat creation."

	description `The Hai rarely speak highly of their weapon systems, but the Capital Turret known only as the "Electronic Winter" is spoken of in fearful, reverent terms. A pair of overclocked ion cannons strapped to a turret mount, the weapon can quickly drain even massive battery stores thanks to its incredible range and rate of fire.`

	description "The Hai have had many centuries to war amongst themselves, and as such, they've developed technologies to counter their own weapons. This large-scale surge protector exerts a countercharge against incoming ionic attacks, sharply reducing per-shot delivery. To protect the capacitors from damage, the surge protector only discharges so much of an attack at a time."

	description "Another way to circumvent ion damage is to exert a stable, steady countercharge that equilizes the electric field produced by an ionic weapon, causing the ion damage to shed away much faster. However, this takes a fair bit of power; in some cases, it may actually take more power to dispell the ion damage than it does to just live with the ion damage as-is."

	description "Unlike Human Auxilary Shield Matrixes, which operate as an extension to your ship's internal shield matrix and thus use no extra energy, Hai Shield Dynamos actively consume a steady stream of power to generate additional support fields for your ship's shields. The result is a MASSIVE improvement in space efficiency, at the cost of power consumption."
	description "The Hai name their auxilary shield matrixes after fabrics of varying comforts, as beefier shields tend to soften the blow of hard-hitting weapons."

	description "This enormous shield dynamo is widely considered overkill; you're likely better off just installing a larger regenerator if protection is a worry to you. But if first-strike capability (or a lack of heat creation) is important to you, you can always slap one of these on your craft to massively increase its short-term durability."
