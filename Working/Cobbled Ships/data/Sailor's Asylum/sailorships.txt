	description "The original prototypes of this ship were cobbled together from Navy Drones captured in the early days of the south, when the Navy's presence was much easier to overwhelm. With some time and innovation, though, the newest models include quite the featureset, including small amounts of cargo space, a mining beam, a small shield matrix for blocking asteroid debris, and even a fancy vector thruster system."
	description "Though technically not designed for frontline combat, their combination of a heavier armament, shield matrix, and low cost makes them an appealing option for freighter defense."

	description `The Type-S Sparrow, also affectionately known as the "Seagull" by many Sailor captains, is a sea-to-space interceptor designed to fulfill either a mining role or a convoy defense role. As a bulked-up Sparrow, it's quite a bit more durable, and even packs twice the gun ports for optimal firepower. Many starting captains in the Archipelago choose the "Seagull" as their starter ship, and scantly regret the decision.`

	description "This heavily remodelled Quicksilver was designed as a simple, cost-effective solution to the need for a mining ship that carry hyperdriveless drones between the stars. Though the rearrangement has sadly had a negative effect on the ship's firepower and speed, it's resulted in a handy ship that can fulfill a variety of roles in addition to those it was designed for."
	description "Though not technically suited for use as a flagship, the Silver Lining finds itself the head ship in many small mining startups' fleets whose captains can't afford something more exotic or impressive."

	description "The rugged design of the hauler has lead humanity to iterative improvements over the years, but nothing quite like Sailors' implementation of the easily modular craft. This newest warship-esque design has been their latest improvement, with vastly improved durability and weapon capacity, as well as much larger engines. Though the ship retains the classic look, the sheer scope of the interior improvements have practically upped the price by an order of magnitude."
