	description "The Sailor's Asylum, free of any original human trademarks, had plenty of opportunity to tweak and tune human technology to their needs. This modified beam laser includes a built-in asteroid scanner, making it an extremely useful tool for anyone starting a mining operation."
	description "The Beam laser itself is optimized for cutting through rock and metal with exceptional efficiency, so the anti-shield power is much weaker. Additionally, the modifications make the beam consume much more power and generate more heat."

	description "The Particle Cycler is an attempt to recapture the power of the Republic Navy's Particle Cannon. Though the weapon isn't quite as deadly as its older brother, it's a bit smaller and fires much faster, wielding more consistent damage output overtime."

	description "The smaller size of the Particle Cycler meant that it could be slotted onto a turret with little issue. Though not the snappiest turret, the considerable range and consistently high fire rate mean that the Cycler Turret is an excellent weapon against small ships with weak engines."

	description "A pair of Particle Cyclers strapped to a rather large, bulky turret. Due to technical issues with the particle supply, the cyclic rate of each gun has been tweaked slightly, so the twin setup does not quite fire at twice the rate. The upside of this is that the internal hardware can be downscaled a bit, meaning the turret is smaller than some other capital ship-grade turrets."

	description "The first thing the members of the (at the time) newly christened Sailor's Asylum was establish independence from both the pirates that cut them off from the rest of human space as well as the corporations and companies they were cut off from."
	description "Compared to its smaller cousin, the gatling gun, the Autocannon has a more consistent damage output, longer effective range, and higher damage overall. It is, however, more costly, and much larger as a result."

	description "This is a pair of autocannons placed onto a rather snappy turret, designed to fend off small to medium-sized craft at a substantial range. Though the turreted version is rather bulky, it carries a bit more ammunition than two separated autocannons, making it more useful in prolonged battles."

	description "The material Fissite has some odd properties, reacting with energy in ways that humanity doesn't fully understand. What is understood, however, is that the damage output of a regular blaster can be nearly doubled for only marginal increases to power and heat cost with the addition of some finely-carved fissite to the muzzle."
