	description "On a graveyard planet, this ship was cobbled together by a town of scrappy folk and was gifted to their first licensed pilot. Though the original colour is lost to the ages, this remake of that classic beast sports the same raw durability it had those many years ago."

	description "Unlike most other ships, fighters have an upper limit to what sizes they can reach, as carrier bays are standardized in size across human space. The Bumblebee manages to squeeze around these constraints by being as boxy as possible, with its wings able to retract into the main body of the ship during docking to facilitate some amount of elegance."
	description "That said, the Bumblebee is the second largest recorded fighter in human history, capable of taking on some classes of light warships thanks to its heavier armament and more developed shield matrix. It even sports a miniscule amount of cargo space, thanks to the main access shaft doubling as a storage compartment. Compared to other fighters, however, it is considered rather slow, and it suffers from poor heat dissipation."

	description "When Lionheart saw how popular an impractically large, powerful fighter could be, their engineers set to work creating a Fighter to a demanding set of specifications: It had to be larger, more durable, and capable of fielding a heavy anti-missile turret in addition to at least a pair of other weapons."
	description `Though the resulting fighter is an absolute hodgepodge of elements, with extra bunks, only two frontal guns, more cargo space than the Bumblebee, the "Camel Calf" is nonetheless popular for truly pushing the boundaries of what a fighter can be.`

	description "Not to be outdone by the Syndicate, Betelgeuse shipyards began designing an upgrade to their perennial classic ship, the Behemoth. In the end, they produced one of the most powerful ships in human space, its massive armament tempered only by its lackluster weapon capacity. That, and its prohibitively massive cost."

	description "Though the Mammoth is largely big enough to take care of itself, Betelgeuse Shipyards decided to update their Leviathan ship model to feature more guns and turrets than even the largest warships for the purpose of providing a defense platform for such large merchant fleets. With a thick hull and an enormous shield matrix, even one of these ships can be a force to inspire terror."
	description "However, such a massive warship uses a massive crew, and also incurs quite a massive cost."

	description "The Tribocus is a ship of surprisingly modern design: When Betelgeuse came out with their Mammoth and Kraken-class vessels, Lionheart found their position as the sellers of the largest ship in human space in jeopardy. This ship is the result of their pitch back towards the top."
	description "The Tribocus features three custom-made, enormous turrets, designed to destroy even large ships across great ranges using supercritical deuterium. It also features a menagerie of smaller guns, an extremely oversized shield generator, over two Bactrians' worth of cargo space, and hundreds upon hundreds of bunks."
	description "The name was picked in favour of the more dramatic title of 'Magnum Opus'; the scientic name of a genetically engineered three-humped camel, Lionheart felt it only appropriate to name their most enormous, perfect ship after such a mythical animal."

	description "When the Navy saw a galaxy of shifting size classes, the original Carrier suddenly seemed rather small and obsolete. Thus, behind closed doors, the Lancer and its armament were conceived. Armed with two Divine Lances, beams more powerful than any weapon humanity has ever produced prior, the Lancer is one of the strongest ships in the sky, with extremely thick shields and an enormous armament, as well as space for half a dozen fighters and nearly a dozen drones."
	description "The Navy never flies this ship out of respect for laws against unnecessarily powerful weaponry; but should humanity ever need someone to defend it, this ship shall be its lance."

	description `Though the Repeller was already plenty for most needs, the Syndicate developed the Vault as the ultimate in cargo protection. Though it doesn't have nearly as much total outfit space as the 6 protectors it is comprised of, there's no denying its 28 turrets are an effective deterrent.`
	description "Unlike other superheavies, the Vault doesn't have a special turret for long distance, so the weapon's stock armament is entirely proton gun turrets to attempt to remedy the lack of range."

	description "While the Dreadnought was being developed, there was a very real fear of the Navy using oversized ships like the Kraken to deliver a crushing defeat to the Free Worlds. Thus, this much larger, more brutal ship was developed, along with deadly Salvo Turrets to complement its design."
	description "Though its armament isn't quite as large as some other oversized warships, it boasts significantly higher armament capacity, so it can field much heavier guns."

	description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver was already a highly trimmed down design, but with the creation of Megaparsec's Nettle-class warship, the time came to truly push the limit of practical engineering. Employing all-new power cells, the newly-christened Cinnabar is capable of fielding a particle cannon, while also posessing greater durability than something like the Barb."
	description "Built with a turret-like useset in mind, the Cinnabar focusses on turning first, with reverse thrust to allow the keeping of distance from a target. Additionally, unlike many syndicate ships, the Cinnabar is created with extremely high quality hull materials like Graphene. This gives the tiny ships remarkable durability, but results in a significantly more premium price."

	description "Though megaparsec once stopped at the Splinter in terms of size, the shifting tide of the galaxy leading to larger ships began to impart some severe pressure on the shipyard to begin developing their own heavier warships."
	description "This iteration on the Splinter is larger in every way, and is intended to do just a bit of everything; It can haul cargo, provide good frontal and omnidirectional fire support, and can even carry two pairs of fighters thanks to special runways developed during the creation of the ship."
	description "Where the ship makes up for its lesser performance in the areas of combat and hauling, it makes up for in speed. The ship is blindingly fast, and can easily run circles around other warships of its class."

	description `In common pirate slang, a ship that's "hackney" has been assembled, or "hacked", together from the components of multiple ships; usually captured ones. This results in a disjointed ship, typically with a weaker hull than another ship its size, but the customizeability in armament and system capacity is considered worth the concession by pirate outlaws.`
	description "As hackney ships like this one are often cobbled together from boarded or salvaged ship components, there's typically much room for improvement in their kits."

	description "With larger merchant convoys capable of fielding heavier armaments without escorts popping up in the galaxy, the Syndicate needed a new edge to continue to push numbers. The result was the Repeller: A ship comprised almost entirely of a pair of Protectors bolted together. The resulting ship is able to contend with even the largest of Navy ships, but requires a costly license to own and operate."

	description "The Syndicate Striker is a remnant of a time where Syndicated Shipyards' experimental vessels were much more profitable thanks to a lack of competition. The Striker was an attempt at fielding heavier, higher-yield armaments while not drastically expanding the size of human starships. The result is a heavy warship with a potent armament of high-yield dual proton turrets, though forward firepower is has been significantly neglected."

	description "The Bulk Freighter's design left much to be desired on the fronts of speed and defense, resulting in an overall frail and difficult to use ship that didn't pull in the merchant market like the Syndicate wanted it to. An attempt to make a newer freight model while not requiring decades worth of ship factory space being made resulted in the Freight Train: A monstrosity of a ship combining elements of the Bulk Freighter with the more successful Vanguard and Protector models of spacecraft."

	description "In the mess of combat, some captains find combat drones a liability: Weak and easy to destroy, drones don't have an easy time finding a niche in front line combat. However, anti-missile turrets, which also use AI for operation, are a remarkably good fit for automata; able to be strapped onto an easily mobile platorm, a small swarm of anti-missile drones can lock down even large missile systems."
	description "Unfortunately, the light model is very restrictive; a custom power cell had to be designed just to accomodate using such a powerful gun aboard such a tiny ship, and there was no opportunity to include a shield matrix of any kind. The light model is faster than its heavier brother, though, so some merchants will scrape by with the light model if they expect to be safe from pirates."

	description "The Heavy Anti Missile Drone is a much more sustainable model, at the cost of being much more pricey and a fair bit slower than its lighter cousin. With a MUCH beefier power cell and a larger anti-missile turret, it's much more suited to defending a fleet, while still only taking up a single drone bay."
	description "Compounding on the model of a sustainable missile defense platform, these drones even have a custom-built tiny shield generator system, able to recharge their small shield matricies after a blaster hit or two."
