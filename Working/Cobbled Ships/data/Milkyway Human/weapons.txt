	description "This rotating assembly of 6 blasters is capable of outputting a large barrage of sustained fire. An electric motor drives the assembly, consuming power passsively but allowing the gun to dissipate heat even wile not firing, as the barrels act like external radiators."
	description "The design of the Vulcan Blaster also includes experimental projectile generators that are more energy efficient, resulting in a more affordable experience. However, the coils need to cool down briefly after prolonged use, resulting in a need for a brief bit of downtime between volleys."

	description "A Vulcan Blaster assembly mounted on a turret port. Though one of the slower turrets available on the market, the firepower of the equipped Vulcan Blaster is left completely unchanged, allowing it to be a deadly weapon when multiple turrets focus on a single target."
	description "Sadly, however, the addition of the turret swivel does little to negate the considerable heat cost of firing the weapon, and the accuracy of the turret is a bit worse than the fixed version."

	description "This rather bulky turret carries four modified blasters on one mount, providing a staggering amount of power -- and heat consumption. Though far from the largest of turrets humanity has to offer, the combination of a quadruple armament and the already hot-running modified blaster is that the gun exerts a ton of heat."

	description "Spotter Turrets were developed by a small contract company in the deep, specifically designed to provide a large main cannon for a ship otherwise reliant on smaller, less-impressive turrets."
	description "The gun of the Spotter Turrets, affectionately nicknamed the Camel's Hump, after the ship it would be installed on, fires a massive hunk of supercritical deuterium enveloped in a magnetic sheath. The sheath dissipates upon hitting the target, releasing a large blast wave."
	description "Like the name implies, the Spotter Turret requires a dedicated spotter to be used legally within republic space."

	description "This is a heavily modified and upscaled blaster, using tenents of Plasma Turret tech to massively improve the damage dealt.

	description "The internal supercapacitors included in the gun are designed to store just enough energy for a pair of shots, allowing even a ship with less-adequate supporting hardware to fire off a small salvo towards a distant target."

	description "A highly advanced particle gun that ablates the enemy with magnetically charged clumps of mass that seek targets, unleashing their contained energy upon impact. Though the homing is only marginally effective, this weapon excels against large warships that have trouble moving out of the way."
	description "Magnet bombs have far better locking on targets of great size, and their tightly clumped magnetic 'bullets' last for what some consider an annoyingly long time. Additionally, they produce a surprisingly low amount of heat."

	description "The Navy's Torpedoes are a difficult problem for many ships to deal with: slow but sturdy, many captains feel a deep loathing for the large, well-protected warheads. However, with some creative tampering, the anti-missile shots of a turret can be dramatically increased in power and range - at the cost of firing speed."

However, with growing fears that the pirates may one day take over the "backdoor" connecting the republic north and megaparsec's own yards, the designers of the Nettle chose to create their own anti-missile turret to establish a level of independence from other part manufacturers.`

	description "Vulcan-class weapons have become synonymous with large-caliber rotary weaponry in recent times, even though traditionally, a vulcan was designed to fire explosive shells at high speed from multiple rotating barrels."
	description "While a Javelin missile isn't exactly an explosive shell, the innovative compressed design of this quintuple barreled rotating missile launcher has drawn plenty of notice from those looking to dish out some serious firepower. In addition, the gun is able to be driven by the propulsive forces exerted by its projectiles, resulting in the weapon being exceptionally energy efficient without needing an external motor."
	description "Though much more massive than most ships will allow, it is exceptionally power- and heat-efficient as a main gun, offsetting its otherwise debilitating size."

	description `When designing their new heavy warship, the designers at Megaparsec realized they didn't have any particularly effective capital ship weapons. With some modification, they designed new armor and superior tracking systems for Meteor Missiles, as well as an improved launcher to compensate. The new "torpedoes" need some more oomph to leave the tube, but they're just as deadly as normal meteors with nearly double the durability.`
