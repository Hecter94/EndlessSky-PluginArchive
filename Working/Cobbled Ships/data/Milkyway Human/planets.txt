planet Twilight
	attributes mining
	landscape land/valley3
	description `Twilight is a strange world, close enough to its parent stars that it is tidally locked, with one side in a permanent day and the other in a permanent night. A thin strip between these two sides, however, is quite habitable, and holds several small navy outpost.`
	description `	Though there has been some limited interest in building a large solar farm on the light side of the planet, most of those in the Republic parliament are against putting importance on such a small, out of the way planet. Its only exports are minerals harvested by miners looking for an uncontested source of metals.`
	spaceport `The Spaceport on Twilight wouldn't be special if it weren't for the intriguing fact that it was built on the dark side of the planet; though regions near the habitable band are more temperate and still reasonably lit, the furthest reaches of the spaceport are shrouded in darkness and are very cold.`
	spaceport `	There's a painfully still air of a lack of morale over the Republic soldiers stationed here. This planet is often neglected in terms of supplies, so most of the personnel here live in what can only be described as steps away from poverty.`

planet Undertow
	attributes pirate "south pirate" south frontier
	landscape land/sea1
	description `Undertow is an ocean world, with a surface approximately 97% covered by saltwater. Its close moon drags its oceans along the equator, further complicating the oceans' already intense patterns. The only land is concentrated on the south pole, and is surrounded by large glaciers.`
	spaceport `Undertow's spaceport consists of a handful of large, flat landing pads with warehouses crammed into the glacial ice. The planet is cold enough that, at least with the culture's current industrial scale, there's no worry of the polar glacier melting, so it's considered stable by the locals.`

planet Thaumatiin

	landscape land/sea2
	description `Thaumatiin is a rare example of a world kept barely alive by freak accidents. The gravitational waves exuded by its host wormhole as well as the faint heat from the brown dwarf it orbits keep the average surface temperature at a temperature around -40 degrees celcius. Not comfortable, but the pirates that call the planet home have adapted.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is suspended in a large canyon, kept dry and safe from sea spray only by the miles-high mountains on either side of it. Though the exterior temperature is still cold, the buildings of the spaceport and market are heated, providing a decidedly habitable (if displeasant) atmosphere.`

	description `From above, Snowtunnel doesn't seem uninhabited at all, as all of the lodgings are built beneath dozens of meters of snow. Even the (limited) defenses for the colony established here are placed strategially beneath cliffs or high snowbanks.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a large assembly built under a sheer cliff face, allowing for access from ships without being visible from the topside. Further into the rock are amenities like the market and job board; for a pirate world, the businesses are exceptionally civil in nature.`

	description `This small station sits quietly on the other end of what the locals know as the "Great Vestibule". Looking at star charts reveals that you're far from even the deepest of human space, thoroughly in no man's land.`
	description `	There are pieces of technology you've never seen the likes of hanging around, making the hacked-together station even more curious. Fierce-looking, well-armed mercenaries patrolling the station quickly stop you from getting too close to anything exotic.`
	spaceport `The station is very ramshackle in appearance, with ramscoops in place of proper fuel refining equipment, and most pieces of the station's hull in... Dubious at best condition. However, there is a market full of all sorts of fixtures of less-than-legal living, and a large shop selling all sorts of human ammunition.`

	description `The Hai living on this planet and the human pirates in the next system over are locked in a fierce staring contest; the pirates won't allow the Hai into human space without a prohibitively high surcharge, and the Hai won't allow such violent, aggressive people into their space. Thus, this is where Hai space begins in the great vestibule.`
	spaceport `The architecture of the spaceport is unlike anything you've ever seen, with various Hai scampering between warehouses, loading up their caravans for the journeys through the wormhole in the next system over. The landing pads, notably, are circular, rather than rectangular.`

planet "Pau Wau"
	attributes hai "hai tourism"
	landscape land/forest4
	description `The Hai had to do some terraforming work on this planet to make it habitable, but it's considered well-worth it for the fact that they can have direct control over the wormhole into their space. Unlike the human pirates on the opposite end of the great vestibule, the Hai here do not keep stocks of anything interesting.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is unusually well-defended, even by alien standards. Large pulse turrets eye your ship dubiously all the way down to the landing pads, making you worried you'll be shot out of the sky for a moment. It's apparent that the Hai here have had issues with human pirates, so some kind words and a courteous depowering of your weapons systems gets you past the scrutiny of the Hai.`

	description `Dena Moh is unique in Hai space for being the moon of a moon. No one actually knows just how this happened, but it's a popular tourist destination for scholars looking to question everything they know about astronomy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here isn't anything special; a bunch of flat landing pads carved into the rock, with the only visual intrigue coming from higher and lower platforms, presumably carved from mountains of different heights.`

planet Treehouse
	attributes hai "hai tourism"
	landscape land/forest3
	description `Treehouse is a rather aptly named urban hai world, with most residents living in two- or three-story apartment complexes fashioned from the stiff, durable wood of the trees here. Treehouse's atmosphere is quite thick, and the planet is on the edge of being too warm to be comfortable for Hai, but is kept cool enough thanks to the fact that it orbits around its host planet, allowing it to be shielded from the sun for some of the time.`
	spaceport `Treehouse's spaceport stands out to you as the only major building not made of wood; it also seems to act as the hub of industry, as the only large power plants are located within its vicinity. It's structured like a giant tree, with a central tower nearly 10 kilometers thick and branches with landing pads and grappling arms coming off on thick struts.`

planet "Faux Till"
	attributes hai "hai tourism"
	landscape land/badlands3
	description `Though the hai much prefer to terraform planets, all of the farming on Faux Till is done in greenhouses in hydroponics due to the fact that the atmosphere of the planet is very dry and dusty. Most of the Hai even recommend you wear a mask while on the surface due to the silt kicked up by the breeze.`
	spaceport `The Spaceport is an enclosed dome with high spires the welcome ships into the heart of the large agricultural complex. Though the air is dry inside, it's relatively dust-free, and is easy enough to breathe that you feel comfortable. The temperature is kept very cold in the main hub; too cold for your liking, but perfect for a Hai.`

You're presented the option to either book a fancy room, or just stay in your ship.`
	spaceport `The station is clearly tailored to higher-paying customers, with luxury accomodations on the outside of each ring, and less impressive crew cabins on the inside. Guest rooms are lavishly furnished with wood, red carpet, and gold fittings; and, of course, a massive radiation-shielded bay window to get a good view of the star's nebula.`

	description `This planet is very similar to the Hai homeworld, and as such, is their "emergency backup" if their homeworld were to be captured for any reason. It houses a well-stocked outfitter and shipyard, but requires clearance to be landed on.`
	spaceport `The Spaceport is a marvellous structure comprised of many platforms, carefully interwoven like the petals of a flower. The platforms are the top are the largest, becoming smaller as you get closer to the surface. Warehouses and packed dirt highways stretch for miles around the spaceport, with most civilization even further along the horizon. It's a very beautiful place.`
