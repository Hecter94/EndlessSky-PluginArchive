There seems to be no inherent purpose of putting a ramscoop on a fighter, but some crazed lunatic reportedly "stormed in, guffawing about camel babies, and refused to leave until the baby camel ship had a baby ramscoop".`
	description "Though the ramscoop doesn't perform as well as a classical ramscoop, it is tiny, and thus a good use of space for when there's no other options."

	description "Power Cells are a special kind of fuel cell with an integrated supercapacitor for energy storage, designed for ships that run at extremely specific energy levels. Because they're made so specifically, all power cells are custom-made for the ships they're installed in -- though nothing's stopping you from 'repurposing' the power cell of a ship for use on another."
	description "Power Cells tend to be a bit less heat efficient than fuel cells of a similar caliber due to their customized nature, but the extra power storage can be a boon on ships where heat dissipation is high and outfit capacity is low."

	description "Tower reactors are large-scale, modular nuclear reactor setups, designed to easily attach to one another in well-optimized configurations. The result is one of the most space-efficient, easily-upgraded, and most expensive fission reactors known to mankind. Unfortunately, however, the large size of the reactor core and tower cells means that the system is adapted solely to large warships."

	description `The largest of the tower reactor setups is an odd one. As many competitors will gleefully point out, it's "just too darn big" for most ships. Most ships don't need such a huge reactor, and as such, this installation of the tower reactor is typically joked about by most crews, even though, ton-for-ton, a 6X Tower Reactor is more power and heat efficient than the same mass worth of Armageddon Cores.`
	description "There is, however, some excitement in knowing that one day, perhaps in the future, a ship large enough to make use of this enormous reactor rig will come down the pipeline, and proponents of fission reactors will rejoice."
