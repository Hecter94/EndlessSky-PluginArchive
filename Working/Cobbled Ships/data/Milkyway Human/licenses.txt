	description "With the development of their most powerful classes of ship, the Syndicate Hierarchs found themselves a new niche in the realm of ship handling: The Syndicate offers a license to purchase their biggest warships to anyone with the means to pay; however, the price is almost impossible to attain for solo captains."
	description "This new policy isn't very popular with small merchant captains or the republic navy, but large, independent merchants worried about security applaud the Syndicate's willingness to market to those who don't want the responsibility of belonging to a military regime."
