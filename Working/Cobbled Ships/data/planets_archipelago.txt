	description `Aiole Bay is a warm ocean world with gravity lighter than earth. The landmass here is largely compired of small islands, with only one major continent. Most of the climate is tropical at its coldest, with some of the islands being a sort of wet desert that quickly loses whatever water is rained on it.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an interesting mix of traditional fare and absolutely massive "landing barges" placed in the neary warm sea. The high prevalence of ocean worlds in Sailor space means that many of their ships are designed to transition directly from space-to-sea and back again.`

	description `Occrage is a stormy ocean world, with small floating settlements tethered together forming sorts of countries. The turbulent seas mean that tidal power is extremely efficient, and it is the bulk of energy production here, so the native inhabitants have learned to live with the rough seas and winds.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a large collection of lily pads for landbound ships, as well as large mobile docks for connecting with sea-to-space vessels.`

	description `Prisma is a slightly dry ocean world, with very shallow oceans that only cover about 30 percent of the surface, mostly in the form of enormous rivers that snake down through the equatorial regions from the poles. The stability of its climate and high mineral content in the soil makes it good for growing hearty plants, so food is abundant.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located along the deepest river on the planet, with a form of runway striplights along each bank guiding large sea-to-space ships in for landing. However, most of the traffic seems to be land-to-space instead.`

	landscape land/bwerner3
	description `Millithrawn outpost was an early forward base set up in the Archipelago by humans, before the Sailor's Asylum was even properly formed. Though no planet in its system is particularly habitable, the sheer quantity of minerals was enough to deem it a worthy settling place. There's a section of spaceport dedicated specifically to visitors, and several mining jumpstarts even have their own company landing spaces and warehouses.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is infested with mining equipment, from manual tools to automated drones to special-made mining weapons like beam lasers with integrated asteroid scanners. Metal is so cheap here that some shopkeeps can be seen minting novelty coins from tungsten and gold. Despite this apparent lack of need for restraint, the outpost itself is rather spartain; a few large domes connecting to landing pads surrounded by defense turrets, roads carved into the rocky surface.`

	description `From a distance, Northstar looks like an unoccupied moon, but this is a facade; nearly the entire moon has been hollowed out, with only a few miles of rock left on the surface to act as a shield from micrometeorites as well as a facade to any raiders coming in through the wormhole.`
	description `Though the outfitter is not particularly well-stocked, Northstar houses an enormous set of shipyards, selling all but the most massive Asylum ships.`
	spaceport `The entire planet is like a giant spaceport, with landing bays closest to the surface and other facilities further in. There are an enormous amount of people living in the giant artificial ecosystem; at least a few billion, not including the crews of tens of thousands of merchant ships busily bussing in and out of the harbor.`

	description `Zahel is a fair-sized ocean world, unremarkable if it weren't for the fact that the "gravitational rapids" beyond this point connect to and from Quaitelhut space. Thus, the Sailors and Quaitelhut have established embassies here, where the races convene to share technological, business, or social news.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Zahel is divided into two regions; the larger one is typical of humans, but the smaller one is heated to an inordinately hot 55 degrees celcius; human service workers have to wear climate controlled suits just to work without fear of developing heatstroke.`

	description `Mainaetaihael is a hot desert world, too hot for humans and other earth life to comfortably live on. Daytime temperatures reach 65 degrees celcius, and even the coolest nights are regularly above 40. This type of climate is, however, perfect for the Quaitelhut, who thrive in the hot temperatures.`
	spaceport `The spaceport borders a massive, air-conditioned series of biodomes that the Quaitelhut call their "human embassy". Quaitelhut dressed in heavy, electric-heated coats welcome you into the embassy, as well as humans in much more moderate attire.`
	spaceport `The spaceport design-wise is a large flowing assembly of large semispherical domes on varying "tiers" of infrastructural plates, with smaller landing pads on lower tiers. It's strangely appealing to the eye, but also gives you a discomforting sense of unease, like looking at some sort of giant dead sea worm.`
