# Thrust redirector
#  (minus forward thrust)
#  (adds direction thrust, lower than forward)
#  (generates some heat, less than delta between two above)
#  (uses very little power)

# Solid Thrust
#  visuals: blocks of material being pushed out of the ship.
#  Works by generating thrust based on pushing away of solid materials at high energy levels.


# Electro Thrust
#  visuals: Fork with electrical arcs between them.
#  Works by generating electrical fields and pushing away electrons.


# Ufo Thrust
#  visuals: Multiple "smoke circles" in Green or Blue behind a ship.
