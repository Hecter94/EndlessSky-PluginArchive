	description "This shuttle has been turned into a fighter by aggresive weight reductions and by removal of the tail to allow the shuttle to dock as fighter."
	description "   The weight reductions cause a reduction in cargo space and both hyperdrive and fuel were removed."
	description '   Much better fighters are available and the popular phrase "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft" applies to this shuttle at least as much as to the original transporter version. This version however is also not very suitable as passenger transporter and you wonder why anyone would like to use this fighter.'
