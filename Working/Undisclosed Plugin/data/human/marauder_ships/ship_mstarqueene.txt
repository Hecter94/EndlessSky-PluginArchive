	description "The marble tiles, internal swimming pool and every other heavy piece of luxurity has been stripped out, leaving just the bare chassis of the ship intact."
	description "The reduction in mass causes the ship to speed up faster, but apparently that was not sufficient for the previous owner since the set of engines was also extended."
	description "Each four-post bed has been replaced by multiple bunks, making the spaceous cabins look like crowded cramped military bunkers. Some of the original silk bedsheets are still in use, but they are torn and not wel cared for."
	description "Cargo bays in the ship are filled with human size cages, suggesting that some passengers didn't travel with the ship willingly."
	description "The only cabin that still looks relatively luxurous is the captains cabin. The former owner of this ship did seem to care quite a bit for comfort, but only for him/herself."
