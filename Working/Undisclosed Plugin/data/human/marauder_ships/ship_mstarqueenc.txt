	description "The observation dome is shattered and there is a huge hole in the roof of the panorama deck. The internal emergency airlocks are now serving as regular airlocks."
	description "   Your first impression is that this ship sustained serious damage, but when you look closer then you see that the damaged ship sections are equiped with docking platforms for fighters and drones."
	description "   This formerly elegant ship has been transformed into a rough carrier with sharp edges and dangerous pressure issues. This is in sharp contrast with the luxurity and safety standards that were applicable to the original."
