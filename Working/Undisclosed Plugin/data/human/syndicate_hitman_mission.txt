# **Additional context**
# The spaceport on Trinket refers to travelling on an alternative identity: `Many of the starships parked here have scorch marks and dents on their hulls, a sure sign of recent battle. It is likely that some of the people walking through the port are in fact pirates, posing as civilians in order to sell stolen cargo or to take a vacation incognito.` So the feature to fly with another identity is in-lore for the game.
