			"Because I could not stop for Death - He kindly stopped for me - The Shuttle held but just Ourselves - And Immortality."
			"We paused before a House that seemed - A Cylinder to be launched - The Roof was scarcely visible - The Flag; covering around."
			"Since then, 'tis Centuries, and yet - Feels shorter than the Day - I first surmised the Torpedo Bay - Aimed toward Eternity."

			"Because I could not stop for Death - He kindly stopped for me - The Shuttle held but just one bunk - Most Peacefully. / We slowly flew; He knew no haste - And I had put away - My labor and my leisure too, - For His Civility."
			"We passed the Carrier, where Soldiers strove - In Fighters; in the Void - We passed the Bays with Docked Drones - We passed the Hardened Hull. / Or rather; It passed Us - The Dew drew quivering and Chill - For only Coffins, our Cargo - My Bunk, only Basic."

#We slowly flew; He knew no haste
#And I had put away
#My labor and my leisure too,
#For His Civility.

#We passed the Carrier, where Soldiers strove
#At Recess; in the Ring -
#We passed the Bays with Docked Drones -
#We passed the Hardened Hull -
#
#Or rather; It passed Us -
#The Dew drew quivering and Chill -
#For only strips, my spacesuit - 
#My tether, torn away
#
#We paused before a House that seemed
#A Cylinder to be launched -
#The Roof was scarcely visible -
#The Flag; covering around.
#
#Since then, 'tis Centuries, and yet - Feels shorter than the Day - I first surmised the Torpedo Bay - Aimed toward Eternity.
