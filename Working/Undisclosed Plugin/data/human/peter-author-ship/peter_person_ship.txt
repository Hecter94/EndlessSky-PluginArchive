# Ship type: Hauler VI (modified)
#
# Very very slow moving and turning ship when fighters are docked. Relatively fast when they are deployed.
# Some ships flying in formation around it. (With a stay-in-formation personality on those ships.)
#  Hauler I, Hauler II and Hauler III ships seem ideal candidates to fly in formation around a Hauler VI.
#  The fighters docked inside the Hauler VI could also assume formation once they undock. (But then they should not be equipped with flamethrowers, inhibitors and fast engines, but with something that makes sense for close escort ships.)

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ESS Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI) -> no, this is more a pirate-like ship, not an author/person ship.
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI) -> no, this is more a pirate-like ship, not an author/person ship.
# - Marauder Behemoth
# - Hauler XL (40 pods; 4 pods long, 4 pods wide, with 3 pods wide, 2 pods wide and 1 pod wide layers on top of the lowest layer).
# - Hauler CIV (104 pods; either in flat config, or in stacked config).
# - Double-wide Star Empress with centrally a pool/lake under a huge dome (called PTR Star Lake).
#    - The Chameleon tongue could be just part of the ship.
# - Double wide Star Empress with centrally rotating sphere (or cylinder) in which a large pool of water and some land is located.
#    - There could be a support line over the center of the sphere, upon which turrets can be placed.
#    - 2 carried ships near the cockpit, under 45 degree directions facing forward?
#    - 2 carried ships near the rear, under 45 degree directions facing backward?
# - Ship with a rotating ring on which a central pool/lake is located.


# Other weapons considered (which are not possible in the current codebase):
# - "Healing Beam" "Beam that restores hull on friendly ships."
# - "Preservation Beam" "Beam that restores shield (fully) and hull to just below disabled on hostile ships."
