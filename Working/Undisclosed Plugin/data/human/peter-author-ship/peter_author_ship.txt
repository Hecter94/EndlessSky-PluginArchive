# Author ship for Petervdmeer.

# Ship type: Hauler VI (modified)
# Luxurious StarQueen glass type cockpit on one side.
# Other side of ship is fully dedicated to a spinal weapon (chameleon tongue or dragons flame).
# Very slow moving and turning ship when all fighters are docked. Relatively fast when they are deployed.

# Alternatives considered (but not chosen):
# - Have parts of the Hauler VI detach as separate ships (cockpit as fast attacker with flamethrowers, pods as missile launchers)
# - Have all parts move at very high speed after separation.
# - Have an anti-matter cannon built in into one side (or in a pod that splits off as a separate ship).

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (flat side front)?
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (point front), with bays and weapons in 12 directions
# - Fighter without drives
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ESS Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI)
# - Marauder Behemoth
# - Hauler XL (40 pods; 4 pods long, 4 pods wide, with 3 pods wide, 2 pods wide and 1 pod wide layers on top of the lowest layer).
# - Hauler CIV (104 pods; either in flat config, or in stacked config).
# - Double-wide Star Empress with centrally a pool/lake under a huge dome (called PTR Star Lake).
#    - The Chameleon tongue could be just part of the ship.
# - Double wide Star Empress with centrally rotating sphere (or cylinder) in which a large pool of water and some land is located.
#    - There could be a support line over the center of the sphere, upon which turrets can be placed.
#    - 2 carried ships near the cockpit, under 45 degree directions facing forward?
#    - 2 carried ships near the rear, under 45 degree directions facing backward?
# - Ship with a rotating ring on which a central pool/lake is located.


# Other weapons considered (which are not possible in the current codebase):
# - "Healing Beam" "Beam that restores hull on friendly ships."
# - "Preservation Beam" "Beam that restores shield (fully) and hull to just below disabled on hostile ships."

# Other possible person names:
# - Asbran; sword from a seagod, Dutch/Frysian. Similar to Excalibur, but less known.

# Firing ship should have a personality (or weapon) to ensure that the ship stays at long range from the target.
# Considered turretted version and segmented version (with pull explosions in the ships center during firing), but the beam version seems to give least amount of undesired computational and visual artifacts.
# This weapon works best if it is installed in the center of a ship (to avoid missing the target at short range).
