# Author ship for Peter vd Meer.

# Ship type: Hauler VI (modified)
# Luxurious StarQueen glass type cockpit on one side.
# Other side of ship is fully dedicated to a spinal weapon (chameleon tongue or dragons flame).
# Very very slow moving and turning ship when fighters are docked. Relatively fast when they are deployed.
# Some ships flying in formation around it. (With a stay-in-formation personality on those ships.)
#  Hauler I, Hauler II and Hauler III ships seem ideal candidates to fly in formation around a Hauler VI.
#  Nest, Roost and Skein also seem fitting to fly in formation around a Hauler VI (when it has docking of itself as well).
#  The fighters docked inside the Hauler VI could also assume formation once they undock. (But then they should not be equipped with flamethrowers, inhibitors and fast engines, but with something that makes sense for close escort ships.)

# Alternatives considered:
# - Hiding the docked fighters and docking mechanisms (to hide the speed-up mechanism when it becomes hostile)

# Alternatives considered (but not chosen):
# - Some Esher-like impossible shapes to interconnect the two sets of 3 pods. (Korath has this in-lore in-game, but probably wouldnt work well on the Hauler VI.)
# - Have parts of the Hauler VI detach as separate ships (cockpit as fast attacker with flamethrowers, pods as missile launchers)
# - Weapon that works with patterns like the formations. (Too specific, better just use formations as-is.)

# Alternative ships considered (instead of the Hauler VI or possibly as ships flying in formation):
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (flat side front)?
# - A ship in Hexagonal shape (point front), with bays and weapons in 12 directions
# - Fighter without drives
# - A ship from ES-Stories (the ESS Bactrian looks very nice)
# - Star Queen Engines variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI) -> no, this is more a pirate-like ship, not an author/person ship.
# - Star Queen Carrier variant (possibly flying in formation with the Hauler VI) -> no, this is more a pirate-like ship, not an author/person ship.
# - Marauder Behemoth
# - Hauler XL (40 pods; 4 pods long, 4 pods wide, with 3 pods wide, 2 pods wide and 1 pod wide layers on top of the lowest layer).
# - Hauler CIV (104 pods; either in flat config, or in stacked config).
# - Double-wide Star Empress with centrally a pool/lake under a huge dome (called PTR Star Lake).
#    - The Chameleon tongue could be just part of the ship.
# - Double wide Star Empress with centrally rotating sphere (or cylinder) in which a large pool of water and some land is located.
#    - There could be a support line over the center of the sphere, upon which turrets can be placed.
#    - 2 carried ships near the cockpit, under 45 degree directions facing forward?
#    - 2 carried ships near the rear, under 45 degree directions facing backward?
# - Ship with a rotating ring on which a central pool/lake is located.


# Other weapons considered (which are not possible in the current codebase):
# - "Healing Beam" "Beam that restores hull on friendly ships."
# - "Preservation Beam" "Beam that restores shield (fully) and hull to just below disabled on hostile ships."

# Firing ship should have a personality (or weapon) to ensure that the ship stays at long range from the target.
# Considered turretted version and segmented version (with pull explosions in the ships center during firing), but the beam version seems to give least amount of undesired computational and visual artifacts.
# This weapon works best if it is installed in the center of a ship (to avoid missing the target at short range).
