			`"Well, spaceflight from before anti-grav plating is really incredible."`
			`	"Every launch had to be done on pure engine power, which resulted in enormous machines for just transporting a few persons into orbit or beyond."`

			"We have quite a number of craft available, most of them just for Earth orbit, but we also have some that go beyond simple orbit."
			"The Jules Verne maglev cannon is my favorite, and not because we make most profit on such flights, but also because it is so different from those huge fueltanks with a capsule on top."
			"We also have a 3 person Soyuz capsule on top of a Soyuz rocket. A truely reliable 1967 era design."
			"And then there is the Crew Dragon 7 person capsule. A bit newer, and cheaper, to ride because more people fit in."
			"For the true dare-devels we also have a replicate of the very first spacecraft ever used; the one-person Vostok."
			"Here's also a spacecraft that could reach the moon; an orginal Saturn rocket with an Apollo moonlander on top."
