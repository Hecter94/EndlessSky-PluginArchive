# Planet with rainworm type of creatures that have very advanced 3D printing technology.
# The planet is fully flat, structures are formed as you need them.

# Engines and turrets for sale, but no spaceport (no hiring of crew or refuelling)
# Spaceships incompatible and not for sale.
# Equipment requires high amount of crew (worm ships usually have high amounts of crew, but at the size of worms)

# Rainworm type creatures have problem of invading giant creatures (spaceship size, travel as themselves with some environmental suit).
# Those creatures are large jumping creatures that only recently learned to jump to other planets"



# First mission / first contact mission: 
# Ship "Pile of Dirt" is flying around near earth and tries to contact the player.
# Propulsion is very inefficient, just pieces of rock ejected at high speed to create propulsion in the other direction.



# Once you have landed on the platform you receive an incomming hail. The voice is very faint, but you think you recognize a "Hello" in the message.
#
# Species are worms working together. They don't have voice communication among themselves, so they record the players voice and play back parts of his/her transmissions to communicate.
# You are surprised to hear your own voice answer.
# Worms have some sort of natural 3D printing technique from their bodies. And expanded with artificial 3D printing techniques on their homeworld.


# Clusterers mission1 to add

# Are you one?
# Choice
#   One, what do you mean?
#   No i'm much older
#   Yes, I am the one you are looking for.
#   No, you need someone else.

# Option 1 (highly sentient big creatures):
#   Big creatures that have a huge disrespect for small creatures.
#   The player is one of the smallest things that those creatures still can see.

#   Worms ask player to talk on their behalf to the jumping big creatures.
#   Big creatures respond very disrespectfull and indicate that they don't want to talk.

#   Worms decide that some bigger creature (spaceships are not accepted) needs to do the talking.
#   Mission to guide some of the big jumping creatures to an even bigger creature.
#   Jumping big creatures want payment up-front.
#   Player gets payment from worms to give to big ones.
#   Big ones want to take the money but doubt if they should go.
#     Choice: You have no honour? Your word doesn't mean anything?
#        Response: Honour is based on size. We always keep our word to big creatures.
#      Choice: I demand that you keep your end of the deal.
#         Response: Were you saying anything, small creature?

# Option 2 (low intelligence, instinct based big creatures):
#   Player gets weapons to repell the creatures for worms.
