# Minimally armed ship. Initial ship used by clusterers.
# Looks like pile of dirt (white/light-gray) with some metals sticked through them (in the right colors)
# This is the ship that attempts to contact the player.
# Built in thrust by just ejecting rocks.
# No shields
# Piloted by worms-cluster.
# Slow auto-repair function
# Engines are large and very inefficient
# Rock launcher weapon (part of engines) is also very inefficient.
# outfit "Rock Launcher Thrust Turret"
#	description "Thruster that ejects pieces of stone at very high speed to create propulsion."
#	description "Also usable as weapon."
#	description "Needs turret port, weapons space and engine space"

# Star Empress ship
# Built by worms, but now looking very well polished (same white/light-gray color)
# Ship is a "thank you" to the humans that helped the worms with the invading large electromagnetic weaponized jumping enemies.
# Far more luxurious than star queen. (Makes Star Queen look like a military personell transporter.)
# Sold by ambitious planet close to deep (but not fully established before).
# Ship needs a captain, but only as formality (actually controlled by worms).
# Reconfigures based on day/nighttime and function (large hall turns into sleeping cabins).
# Decent, recognizable engines.
# Good (recognizable) defense systems.
#
# Missions:
# - Investigate origins / build location(s)
#
# - Find out ship production is given to planet as thank you from worms
#   - Player can be angry at planet government for taking the credits
#     - Player gets 1 ship for free.
#   - Player can get angry at worms for taking the credits
#     - Take it too far and the worms start a war based on the confusing player (worms don't have identities like humans have, they get confused if humans fight).
#     - Worms actually develop weapons very fast...
#
# - Travel with new ship
#   - A lot of noise from investigating team.
#   - Politicians choosing for compfort above fear (worms invisible anyway, except to player).
