	description "A very sophisticated launch system that launches very primitive projectiles."
	description "This system is clearly designed by an advanced species that has little experience with war."



# High crew requirement due to worms crew defaults
# Very long distance, very small effect (and expensive turret)
# Passive cooling and active cooling while firing?
# No energy requirements, no crew requirements
# Very large outfit size, very small effect

	description "Beam that continuously transfers a tiny amount of heat towards a target ship. Not very damaging, but with a very long range."
	description "Superheated heatsink surrounded by movable heatshields. Works as cooler when the heatshields are moved away from the heatsink and as directed long-distance heat-transfer weapon when they surround the heatsink."
	description "This weapon has quite some moving parts, and this weapon (like other Clusteres weapons) has very limited computer control so it requires quite some crew to operate."

	description "This is basically a bag filled with superheated particles. The particles are fairly standard, but the bag is able to deform and move around heat at incredible speeds using some kind of fast 3D printing and teardown technology."
	description "This turret does not turn, but the bag forms protuberances and small ruptures on the side where hostile ships appear to launch pockets and clouds of superheated particles towards the hostiles."



# Heat Pockets Turret: Heat sink (sphere with vertical cooling fins, skeleton around it where pockets are created on top of the heat sink.
#   Pockets move very slowly. Contain a lot of heat.

# Fires/creates bubbles with heat inside. Hitting does heat damage and little else
