			`While enjoying some food in a rather posh spaceport restaurant, you notice a group of 4 secretive elder gentlemen at a nearby table. One of the men keeps looking at you and finally gets up and comes over to your table.`
			`	"Sorry for the interruption. Aren't you <first> <last>, the starship captain who played a vital role in the archeological discoveries on Zug?"`
			choice
				`"Yes, that's me"`
			`	"In that case, you may be just the person we are looking for."`
			`	He introduces himself: "I am Benoit, and over there are my friends Sherlock, Hercule and Stephan. We are looking for a trustworthy and reliable captain who will transport us on a rather delicate mission."`
			`	He looks at you rather conspicuously and whispers: "We will solve the mystery of 'Rhon the Traveler'!"`
			`	You have no idea who Rhon the Traveler is, but the fancy restaurant and the impression that Benoit and his friends leave indicate that this could be a rather lucrative opportunity.`
			choice

			`	He smiles and continues: "It turns out he left the vast part of it to 'whomever is worthy by solving the clues I have laid out'."`
			`	Looking at his friends he finishes: "Rhon was quite a genius, so solving his puzzles is going to be tough, but that is exactly the challenge that my friends and I enjoy."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds interesting. What would I have to do?"`
				`	"I'm sorry, but I am not really interested into chasing phantoms."`
					goto "not interested 1"
			`	"Well, you would have to take us to the legacy disclosure, where all interested parties receive the first clue. This will be in the Kugel system and we will pay you <payment> just to take us there."`
			`	With a smile he continues: "After that, it depends on where the clues will take us. I would not be surprised if this will become a chase through the entire known galaxy. And maybe even beyond..."`
			`	His expression becomes earnest.`
			`	"I fear, it will also draw attention from some rather unpleasant and violent subjects. Therefore, you and your ship must be up to the task."`
			choice
				`	"So far, so good. But what is in it for me?"`
				`	"Sorry, but this sounds rather dubious to me. You have to look for someone else."`

Since none of my group has any use for such a device, the ship would be yours, in case we succeed. That and 5 percent of the rest of the inheritance."`
			choice
				`	"That surely sounds interesting. Count me in"`

			`	Once the kids are in bed, you enjoy a good bottle of wine and entertain Joe and Maria with stories from your travels. When you mention your latest encounter with the treasure hunters, Mariah sits up straight.`
			`	"<first>, are you serious? Do you really have a clue to the legacy of Rhon Danperi?"`
			`	Since you had never heard of him before, you are surprised that Maria knows him. You tell her so.`

			choice
				`	"What happened then?"`
			`	"Well, he was wanted by law and the pirates, so, he did the only thing he could - he disappeared. Rumor says he went to alien space, but no one knows for sure."`
			`	"Many years later, he resurfaced. Since he had never killed anyone during his raids, he was no longer wanted by the law. So, he travelled through the systems and tried to make amends for what he had done in the past by helping."`
			`	"He also spread his message of peace. He quickly became popular, even administrations sought his advice. He was a very smart man."`
			choice
				`	"And the Pirates?"`
			`	"Right, there was still a large bounty on his head. Several gangs tried to cash in, but it did them no good. Rhon never attacked, but those who went up against him, he destroyed without mercy. His ship could not be touched by anything built in human space."`
			choice
				`	"Wow, where do you know this from?"`
			`	"They turned 'Rhon the Rat' into a scare for children. But I don't like being scared, so I started digging and found out the complete story. Hearing of him actually gave me hope for a better life, which ultimately led to our escape."`

			`	In the ship, you hand Maria the paper with the lines and dots. She takes a look at it and then smiles.`
			`	"<first>, can we have front and back scanned and then projected on each other?"`
			`	You perform the scans and bring them up on a holo screen.`
			`	"Joe, do you still recall Rhon's coat of arms?"`
			`	Joe paints a pattern onto a different corner of the screen. Maria makes some small adjustments and then resizes and projects it on top of the pattern scan. Then she cuts out three triangular portions following the outline of the coat of arms.`
			`	"It must be these, already in his pirate days Rhon was obsessed with the number 3."`
			choice
				`	"That's right. The first clues were actually handed out 333 days after his death."`
			`	Maria nods absently. She turns and overlaps the triangles and then flips the pieces until suddenly the previously chaotic patterns connect and form a set of symbols.`
			`	"That's an old pirate trick to encode information, unless you know the areas and angles even the smartest computers will have trouble decoding this. However, those symbols mean absolutely nothing to me."`
			`	Now it is your turn to be excited. "They do to me. This looks like symbols used by the Hai."`
			`	Maria and Joe look confused. "Who are the Hai?"`
			`	"They are an alien race which I have met during my travels. I believe, we may have just solved the first clue."`
			choice
				`	"However, I cannot read those symbols myself and to have them deciphered, I need to travel into a different region of space."`
			`	You store a copy of the symbols on a data crystal and erase all traces of your discovery. You return with Joe and Maria to their home and spend the rest of the evening wondering about what is to come.`
			`	When it's time to leave, they wish you good luck for your adventure. You promise to give them a share if your hunt is successful.`
			`	Back on your ship, you start educating yourself about Rhon, his life and his teachings, and find that he was indeed a fascinating person.`
			`	You may have overdone it with your studies, though. In your sleep you dream of Rhon visiting you.`

So Rhon decided to leave Hai space to restore peace."`

Sometimes, the officers running the blood check can be a bit... difficult."`

Ensuring that we participate from any interesting discovery may have been the decisive argument to send someone along, but Taely is really fond of you and genuinely wanted to help you. And for me, this is the chance I have been waiting for. I am in this as much as for Taely as for myself."`

			`	It is then that you realize what makes her stand out amongst other Remnant. It is the color of her eyes. Where most of the Remnant have dark eyes, her are a warm amber, almost golden.`
			`	She speaks softly: "I have seen this view a hundred times and still love it like the first time. Some may call it the Ember Waste, but for me it is more home than Viminal."`
			choice
				`	"How so?"`
			`	"I pretty much grew up in this area. My mother worked for the Remnant military and was part of the unit which would maintain our scout network and patrol the Ember Waste systems. Most of her comrades preferred short turns, but she only returned to HQ when she had to."`
			`	You wonder: "That must have been tough for you as a child".`
			`	"Not really. We were never really alone. There were more like my mother who also had kids and then there were civilians who were vagabonding through the systems. We would often meet in small groups and spend time together. We were a committed community and could absolutely rely on each other. We're known as the 'Ember-People'"`
			`	"The symbols from the clue are in 'Ember' dialect. So this Rhon must have been part of the community, at least for a while. It is strange I never heard of him."`
			`	You consider what she said for a moment. "Well, it was clear that Rhon, after he had fled the Hai, somehow ended up in Remnant space. It's not unlikely that he got stranded and was saved by someone from the 'Ember-People'."`
			choice
				`	"So, how did you find your way to Viminal and end up with Taely?"`
			`	"Well, in the Waste you learn all sorts of practical things pretty fast. And mother also saw to it that I got a proper education in all other matters. She wanted me to also know the regular Remnant life. She and Taely go way back, mother often brought her interesting things, so Taely took me under her wings."`

			`	"What about your father, then?"`
			`	For a long moment, she is silent. "I... I don't know who he is. Mother would never speak of him. I once overheard an argument between her and Taely, where mother blamed the government for him not being with us. That's pretty much all I know, because neither Taely nor any of the Ember-People would tell us more."`
			`	You take her hand and gently squeeze it.`
			`	She squeezes back. "Thank you, Captain, for listening. I guess, I should better leave now."`

			`	While you believe that her friendliness is genuine, you also know that her task is to make sure that you follow Danforth's instructions.

			`	You have lunch together and you manage to catch up with almost everyone, except for Ulrich who instead ogles all over 'the peaceful Squirrel People Lady and the Giant Bird'.`

			`	"And to prevent any more encounters with those Neanderthals from the Republic Intelligence." You can hear the disgust in Raven's voice as she joins the thread.`
			`	The - newly promoted - Captain Paris wants to know: "What happened?" "They pulled a Void-Punch test on him" "Seriously?" "Oh yes. And on Elias Hanover, too. The Quarg were not impressed, caused quite a diplomatic tussle. The Reps don't deserve the name 'Intelligence', if you ask me."`

			`	"Tohra and I were in heaven. But it all changed when we decided to travel to Viminal together, to officially integrate me into Remnant society. Fate has a tendency to hit you when you least expect it. For me, it was the blood check after I had landed on Viminal. The alert went off. Until today, I have no idea why, because I am definitely no Alpha and I despise them and all what they stand for. But that didn‘t matter. My blood contained too much non-human DNA and I was arrested and detained."`
			choice
				`	You hear Raven mutter "Now it makes sense..."`
			`	But you continue to listen to Rhon: "Tohra was furious, especially since the results were ambiguous. And she had the entire Ember-People community behind her and had good connections to parts of the government. So, this quickly turned into a huge political controversy and become something much bigger."`
			`	"In the end, paranoia prevailed and I was banned for life from Remnant space and the Ember Waste. While officially Tohra brought me back to Human Space, she hid me at the place you are now going to, which I refer to as 'The Hideout'. Back then, the Remnant military regularly ran patrols there, Tohra's unit and the Ember-People saw to it that we could spend a lot of time together and I had regular company there. We had everything we needed, including a small cloaking device, in case unexpected visitors would show up."`
			`	You notice that the last remark draws the attention of your human passengers, and so does Rhon. With a wink, he says: "Well, I guess that is enough material for discussions for now".`
			choice
				`	You turn towards Yohna, wondering how she is taking the news that she might have Alpha DNA in her blood.`
			`	Yohna is shocked, but Raven, who sits beside her, quickly comes to her aid. She takes Yohna's hand and consoles her.`
			`	"This was the first thing I learned in my training - to reliable detect anything Alpha. You definitely have no Alpha DNA."`
			`	Yohna is relieved. Raven continues: "I do sense something different about you, so far I thought it was because you're Remnant, but I believe it could actually be the traces of non-human DNA. And given, how Rhon turned away from being a dominating Pirate warlord to ultimately a messenger of peace, I have a theory about that."`
			choice
				`	You suggest: "You mean that Rhon - and consequently also Yohna - are carrying DNA similar to 'Elias Hanover'?"`

One regular member of Tohra's unit had an accident and was replaced on short note by a young jar-head. He found out about this place and thought, he could make a name for himself and ratted everything off to the paranoid faction."`
			`	"Tohra was detained and it would have been my death-sentence, had Marla, the head of the shipyards and a close friend of Tohra, not taken a Starling prototype and evacuated me in the last moment. I returned Marla to Viminal under cloak, but then had to leave Remnant space for good."`
			`	"It was all very chaotic, with Tohra being in prison and me being searched by the military, so I wasn't even able to talk to Tohra and to say good-bye. Marla gave me instructions on how I could leave a trace for Thora and she promised she would find me, even if it would take her a decade. It actually took her almost two. But eventually, we were reunited."`

			`When you approach the target coordinates on the planet, you see a lake without any landing platforms at first. Rek suggests to broadcast the song and when you do, the landing site uncloaks. It is on the shore of the lake, and consists of a larger hut, some technical buildings and a small hangar. It is very idyllic and cozy.`
			`	When you enter the hut, you are awaited by Rhon who is in the company of an elderly, but extremely charismatic woman - undoubtedly Tohra. She continues the story, with Yohna translating the signs into English.`
			`	"What I didn't tell Rhon, because then he would never have left - at the time of my imprisonment, I was pregnant. Since Rhon could not be found, they had nothing on me but the word of a traitor, so I was acquitted and went back to service. It was a major setback for the paranoids and shifted the power away from them. The traitor became the scapegoat for both sides and had to flee. Rumor is, he went to Human Space and joined the Pirates."`
			`	"Marla, my dear friend, had to step down over the 'lost' Starling prototype and handed the reigns down to the young Taely, who she had already been grooming for the last years. As you might have guessed by now, we were all Ember-People, so we had each others back."`
			choice
				`	You can hear Yohna's voice tremble with emotion, as she continues to translate.`
			`	"I decided to give my child a normal upbringing. So, I had everyone involved sworn an oath that they would never disclose the truth unless I allowed them to, and amongst Ember-People, such an oath is binding, so everyone obeyed."`
			`	"Once Yohna had her own life, I could finally search for Rhon. Because of my rank, I would not have been allowed to leave, so when my ship crashed on that asteroid, it was the opportunity I had waited for. I faked my own death and went after him. It took me a while to find him, but I was finally reunited with the love of my life, and we were happy together once more."`
			`	Tears are now streaming down Tohra's face and Yohna stops translating, but your Remnant is good enough to understand: "At least up to the moment that he learned about Yohna. That is when he decided to leave his old live behind, to meet the daughter he had never known. Yohna, I hope that you can understand or at least forgive me for the decisions I made."`
			`	It is then that you realize that you are not talking to holograms. Rhon slowly walks to her daughter and takes her into her arms.`

			` Outside, Taely is awaiting you. You introduce her the new party members from Human space. Finally unbound from her oath, Taely tries her best to fill in the missing pieces, while you translate for the others:`
			`	"When you, not even Remnant born, showed up with signs from the Ember-People, I realized that this must have something to do with Tohra and Rhon. While I could say nothing, my oath was not stopping me from allowing Yohna to join your quest and learn the truth that way."`
			`	"I am one of the few people left who know about 'The Hideout', so on a hunch I checked it out, and to my surprise, I found Tohra and Rhon, both well and alive. They had apparently also faked Rhon's death and were in the final preparations of a secret trip to Viminal. When I told them that Yohna was following their leads, they decided to wait for her, here."`
			choice
				`	"But if Yohna is Rhon's daughter, why was she not detected by the DNA scanners?"`
			`	"For the first couple of years, we made sure she didn't have to do a blood test. I used all the resources and connections we had to get a sample of real Alpha DNA. That allowed us to improve the detectors. By now, even Rhon will pass."`
			`	She answers a couple of more questions and then you decide to split up and have a look around. Taely explain Paris and Raven the security configuration of the site. Later, you spot them on a jetty, taking in the peace and serenity of the place.`
			`	You have an animated discussion with Rek and Sayari about the turn of events. While you believe that the quest has ended, Rek is sure that this was not the end. You wonder how she knows.`

I followed them under cloak and observed that they were harvesting Yottrite. When the Automata appeared, another wormhole appeared out of nowhere, they flew into it and the wormhome disappeared again."`

Except for mining lasers, their ships would not carry any weapons. Until then, their only encounters had been Automata and Alphas, that is the reason they usually disappeared as soon as another ship was approaching."`

# Helps Quargs to deal with some Pirate / Farming troubles or something else to obtain some Quarg tech
# Goes on to wonderer space - since he speaks Hai, he can communicate? Or else he learns the language
# Chase through Wanderer planets
# This is where Rek comes into play / why he knew the quest was not done. Something happened in the wanderer past which lead to Rhon being allowed to use the old plans and the facilities to build his own Hurricane
# Gets into trouble for fighting the Unfettered when they start stealing, because this is not the Wanderer way - reason to leave?
# Somehow has to get into Coaltion space
# Chase through Coalition space

# The characters and backstory ideas
# Sayari - knew Rhon, helps in Hai space, motivates Danford to join her and Rek and form an aliance between the 3 races and have first official contacts with Korath.
# Rek - one of his closer relatives also had dealings with Rhon, helped him to the Hurricane plans and let him build the ship. Was therefore punished. Rek hopes that if she can present the further story of Rhon to the Leaders that they might pardon her relative. She and Sayari become good friends and motivate Danford to visit the Wanderer leaders with them.
# Yohna - helps with all things Remnant related, ensures that Remnant secrets are not revealed.
# Raven - Sent by Danford to be his eyes and ears and to participate in any interesting findings. Develops feelings for Paris. Either part of the delegation that visits the Wanderer elders or leaves with Paris on mission or vacation.
# Paris - Representative of the Deep. Similar function as Raven. Sees an opportunity for revenge when it turns out that Belzebub is a part in this. Develops feelings for Raven. Either part of the delegation that visits the Wanderer leaders or with Raven on mission or vacation.
