	description "Once a favorite ship design of the Republic, the Monitor eventually became outclassed as the Frigate's shielding and weaponry improved. As a result, the ship has become publicly available."
	description "The Monitor is capable of mounting large weapons for its size, but has a rather weak shielding matrix. The poor durability is likely what led the Navy to drop the design."
