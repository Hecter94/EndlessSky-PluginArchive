	description `	Uziri was founded after Lilac, but people usally don't refur to Uziri as a so called, "arena," but rather as a "fighting pit." This is due the fact that instead of having arena jobs as a 1v1 or a teamed battle, you're are put into teams (you're in the blue team) and told to fight other teams in a colection of systems.`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Uziri is bigger than Lilac's beacause people prefur the fighting action here then in Lilac. You think this is beacause the enemies here are weaker, but your not entirely sure.`

planet "Lilac"
	attributes arena
	landscape land/city0
	description `	Lilac was the first arena founded and also the hardest arena founded. People who compete in this arena are required to be very prepaired with most of their ships mostly being from aliens. Some examples of common ships used in this arena include the Korath Raider and the Quarg Wardragon, both of which have very rare outfits to plunder, but are very hard to obtain. Dispite the risk, many people come to compete in this deadly arena, most of the new people being turned down and told to go elsewhere.`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Lilac, while filled to the brim with restraunts, hotels, and attractions, is also ment to teach new arena players how to fight and survive. Unfortinatly, these methods of teaching aren't too good and most beginners who learn from them fail in combat.`
