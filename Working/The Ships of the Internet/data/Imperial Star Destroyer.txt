	description "With a length of 1,600 meters, the wedge-shaped Imperial-class Star Destroyer was distinctly bigger than its immediate predecessor, the Venator-class Star Destroyer, which had been developed for the Galactic Republic during the Clone Wars. In keeping with the Empire's habit of favoring muted colors whenever possible, the hull of the Imperial-class was painted in gray, while the Venator-class of the Clone Wars-era had red markings"
