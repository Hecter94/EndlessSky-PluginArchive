	description "This weapon has been controversial for causing the most collateral damage out of all of Frozan Dynamics' products, yet still remains their most popular infantry weapon used by the Vollsquor. With two firing modes, one for unleashing a constant stream of area suppression and the other for charging up a bolt that detonates like a plasma grenade for enemies hiding behind barriers, it is considered a brutal but effective tool for sweeping out the enemy."
