	description "The Vollsquor specialize in destructive force. When the time calls for it they aren't afraid to show it even in their defense vessels. The Defractor E Gunship is their latest design, sporting enough laser batteries to melt through even the fastest moving ships. Powerful rapid anti-missile batteries provide an impressive screen to missile threats. Armed with two Dragonrage launchers, the Defractor can wipe out swarms of fighters and even cripple ships of larger size."

	description "Prior to the Vehement, the Vollsquor had to rely on surgical strikes and overwhelming numbers to spread fear in the hearts of their enemies. The Vehement has since removed the idea of retaliation  from their inferiors, proving to be too powerful and durable to take head on even with other warships of similar size. The destroyer brings with it two powerful plasma-beam based cannons for quickly crippling warships and two mega laser turrets for continued suppression. It also sports two Gryphon mass-driver turrets for defending against maneuverable vessels. Its only drawback would be... the cost."
