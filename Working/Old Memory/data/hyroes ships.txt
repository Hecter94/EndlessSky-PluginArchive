	description `After the Hyroes Federation adopted the Palamise Doctrine, most of their fleet would be replaced by the PRV Carrier. This carrier design has seen war in every section of Federation territory, able to be quickly manufactured and overwhelm the enemy with firepower and fighter coverage.`
	description `	Because of their low cost, these carriers have become the spine of the Hyroes Federation fleets.`

	description "Although not a Hyroes Federation design in origin, the LVI Battleship has been adopoted for use in defensive roles in system protection and large conflicts. Its massive size can also create an intimidating precense in the battlefield. With an arsenal consisting of long reaching beam turrets, torpedoes and anti-missile defense systems it is ideal for taking on multiple threats at the same time."
	description "	Because of the amount of time it takes to construct a vessel of this magnitude it has become a rare find in the Hyroes fleets and often than not is often deployed with an escort fleet."

	description "The Hyroes Federation's lack of volunteers during their interstellar conflicts made them turn to experimental technologies like automated piloting. Without this technology the Federation wouldn't have been able to quickly expand their territory. The TRT Fighter houses a piloting brain, allowing room for larger outfits. It can also be outfitted with a small anti-missile turret allowing it to better defend the large carriers it's housed in."
	description "	The cheap cost and simple design also allows it to be replaced in a dime when lost in battle."

	description "This finalization of the Incise prototype can be considered the most powerful warship to date. Consisting of the most advanced technologies in the Old Memory galaxy. The initial cost is tremendous, but the fast assembly and overall cheaper maintenance cost has made it a more favorable alternative to other warships in the Hyroes Navy."
