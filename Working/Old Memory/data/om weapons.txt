	description `"If you're using this, you're no doubt a Sun Pirate."`
	description "	The Sun Pirates have found that it's much easier to pin a civilian ship down if they can manage to eat away its fuel first. A cheap combination of technology, but incredibly illegal. The Hyroes Navy is known to destroy any ship carrying this weapon as it's most likely a pirate vessel."
