It has quite a bit of air defenses, with 2 fighter squadrons on the airbase and 12 anti air tanks across the complex. The fighters and AA tanks are unique looking, they look very similar to vehicles from the 21st century. You have a feeling however that their looks are deceiving. You then see someone who looks like the manager of the complex and 2 guards approach you. Strangely enough, the guards also look like they are using guns from the 21st century.`
			`	"Hello Captain," the manager greets you. "I am the manager of this facility. Here in the <origin> branch of NCD co, we sell high quality ships and outfits.

			`	You are then brought across the facility. The facility is surprisingly empty, you suspect that most of this base is automated. You were shown a bunch of outfits and weapons that are now available to you. You were also brought to the base shipyard, where you see what appears to be 21st century fighters for sale. Despite their looks, they are only similar to those 21st century fighters in only appearance, as they share practically no compatible parts, has shields and can fly in space. You are then finally brought to the gun store. Inside, there are a bunch of guns that you can purchase, everything from pistols to anti material rifles. There are also bounties on the mission board. This detour sure was worth it.`
