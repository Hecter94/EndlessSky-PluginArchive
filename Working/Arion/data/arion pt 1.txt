Also, if you wanna do combat missions, try checking out the fighters we sell. They can help bombard the enemy with missiles from long range.

The assault rifles in general are good in pretty much everything, you can swiftly attack enemy ships while still being sure that the enemy can't take over your ship if it goes wrong. Sniper rifles are good for attacking since they can pick off enemies. The riot shield can be used to defend your ship. You can always test out your skills in the base's firing range. If you don't have time however, you can always check the guidebook that comes with every purchase of one of our h2h outfits.

			`	When you jumped in, you saw a station in a sea of nothingness. There is nothing in this 'system' besides this station, which is probably why it was able to stay so near to Sol without being detected. It is a large station, you can see multiple places for your ship to dock, although there is only 1 or 2 ships currently on the station. You can also see multiple lasers, railgun and missiles batteries all over the station. The Handler directed you to dock at Docking station 10.`
			`	When you dock, you can see a group of 3 people waiting to greet you and all of them are armed. The 2 guards are wielding standard Arion assault rifles. However weirdly enough, not all of them human.`

It is wearing a uniform with similar design to the Commodore and Rear Admiral uniforms but with a 3 Gold striped shoulder mark and a gold stripe going down the sleeves and pants.

			`	"Ah," Eliza calmly explains to you, "Our rank system is a combination of the US, UK and NATO rank system. However, we also have a few special ranks that are in kind of a weird position. 2 examples of this are you Handler's rank and mine. My rank is higher than pretty much higher than anyone in this expedition but it is maybe only an 0-7 to anyone outside of this expedition."`

The Handler and Eliza then brings you first brings you to the shipyards. The shipyard is not filled with a lot of people, there are probably only 2-4 people in this area. "This is the best part of getting access to this base," The Handler tells you. "You get access to the better ships we own." "Not only that Captain," Eliza also tells you. "After this we will be bringing you to the outfitter, there you can get some of the best equipment we have, including our specialty, railguns and EMLs. We also have some jump drives that we ‘borrowed’ from the ‘raiders’.” At the Shipyard, you can see multiple ships available for you to purchase on a data pad. You can see that some new ships available to purchase include Super planes and Heavy Warships.`
			`	You are then brought to the Outfitter. At the outfitter, the Handler and Eliza shows you the advanced lasers, E.M.Ls and nuclear weapons that are now available to be purchased by you. There are also improved cloaking, electronic warfare and repair systems that are available.`

			`	After that you are brought to the armory and shooting range. In it ,you can see one person who looks to be the officer in charge of the range watching over 2 soldiers who have just finished practicing with their weapons. When you reach the firing range, Eliza asks you a question. "Did the Handler already teach you about basic firearm handling." Before you can respond however, the Handler responds for you. "Damn, i forgot to teach em that. I sure hope you read the guide book if you purchased any of our h2h outfits. But just in case we should at least teach you basic firearm handling."

There are multiple VR setups that can be used to train infantry, tank crew, pilots, naval captains and starship captains. There is also an obstacle course, gym and martial arts training center. There is also a canteen in the spaceport serving a lot of different kinds of food. You can see a few Captains, Pilots and Soldiers enjoying themselves. This is probably the most populated part of the base, although there are probably only around 50-100 personnel in the spaceport, docking area and canteen combined. “Since you now have access to this base, you are now allowed to use all this equipment too Captain," Eliza speaks to you. "Just, don't break anything, these setups are expensive and you are probably gonna pay for any broken devices."`

			`	"First of, there are the 'Enforcers', you can find them in human space down near Tarazed. They help the 'Guardians' do their job. They are one of the biggest possible threats to this expedition, although they might be useful."`
			`	"Next we have the 'Squirrels', you can reach them by exploring the northern passage that you passed through with Sam."`
			`	"Then we have the 'Shy Guys' or 'Remmies', you can reach them by exploring the uninhabited systems near the Dirt Belt. Although you will need to grab something from the 'Squirrels' to access them."`
			`	"Of course, we can't forget the 'Raiders' that you fought. I'm sure you know how to reach them by now. There is a friendly subsection of them nearby, protected by the 'Enforcers'. Although be careful, above those friendly 'Raiders' there are the hostile automatons."` 
			`	"There is also the 'Birds', located above the northern pirate systems. They fix broken planets."`
			`	"Of course, we can't forget about the 'Alliance', which is a coalition between 3 species. They are located beneath the Southern human space."`
			`	"And of course, there are the 'Interlopers'. They most definitely did some intervention in human space and perhaps in other parts of the galaxy too. They might be useful however."`

There have been complications in our home universe, so a lot of personnel and equipment have been reassigned to help with the 'war'.

We also only have around 1500 personnel with and additional 300 doing NCD co business to project power across this entire universe. We are stretched thin and we can't do much, which is one of the main reasons that you were brought in to help."`
