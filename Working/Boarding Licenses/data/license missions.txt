			`	"Due to your recent valiant efforts, including rescuing a Star Queen filled with our greatest scientists, it has been determined that you are applicable for a Class C boarding license. Such a license usually only goes to someone in a military rank, but you've excelled our expectations, going so far as to both help examine a previously unknown race and thwart an unknown plan by the notorious Beelzebub. When I first questioned you about Albert Foster, I thought that you were just an average yes-man, looking for adventure - or trouble. It makes me contented that I've been proven wrong." She holds out the Class C license. "This license will allow you to capture medium warships and heavy freighters without consequence."`
			`	You prepare to leave the room, but before you can get out of your seat, she leans in, then says something softly. "My brother was one of the rescued hostages on the Star Queen. I'd give you a Class D boarding license in a heartbeat if I was allowed to."`
			`	The guards that escorted you into the complex then begin to lead you out, twisting through the corridors before you finally get back to the spaceport.`
