			`After sitting at the bar for a few minutes, a heavyset but otherwise fairly nondescript man sits down nearby. He looks like he knows how to handle himself. He says to the bartender, "Za's Revenge please," who nods and starts preparing a beverage that gives you the feeling the he should probably be wearing some PPE.`
			`After a minute the newcomer looks at you briefly before quietly saying, "You've been making a name for yourself Mr <last>. It seems your predilection for space violence has made you at least one rather powerful enemy."`

You hear Hippinse say "That was impolite. But before we discuss what just happened, if I take my boot off your neck are you going to do anything else stupid?" You don't really have any choice but to shake your head and the pressure on your neck is gone. You sit up to see Hippinse standing over you with the hint of a smile on his face and you rub your stinging cheek. Hippinse says, "You might be a tough opponent in space but apparently down here you... aren't. Might want to take that into consideration next time. Weren't you ever taught to be polite to strangers?"`

			`	"They'll be using three Falcons, modified with expensive outfits including Electron turrets. This is a powerful weapon but with somewhat limited range, might want to use that to your advantage. The falcons will be supported by two or three Ravens, afterburner and heavy laser fit. They don't like using missiles so anti-missile turrets won't help you, though they do use such turrets themselves so you might want to consider using energy weapons exclusively. Lastly, they don't have jump drives."`
			`	"I suggest you prepare accordingly, as quickly as possible."`
			choice
				`	"How do you know all this?"`
			`	"I know people and I hear things," he says, "Information is everything." Hippinse gets up to leave but before walking away says, "You should probably keep in mind that there could be other groups looking for your head too, now and in the future. This is just one group I happen to know about. Take care." He walks away. You start to think about how to deal with this threat, and if it even exists.`
