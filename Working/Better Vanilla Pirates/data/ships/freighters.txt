	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Clipper is the smaller sister ship to the popular Southbound Shipyards Argosy. Although not able to carry as much cargo, Clippers are versatile ships that can be used as passenger transports, couriers, or even warships in a pinch, and they come with enough free space to be customized based on an individual captain's needs."

	description "The Freighter is designed by the Syndicate to be an efficient means of carrying cargo from system to system, but is so slow and difficult to land that most pilots hate flying them."
	description "	Freighters are an obvious target for pirates, but turn much too slowly to be able to bring any forward-facing guns to bear on an approaching enemy. As a result, the latest model of freighter is equipped only with turrets, including an anti-missile turret to prevent attackers from simply bombarding them into submission from a safe distance."

	description "Several centuries ago, in the early days of the Republic, the sudden increase in commerce and space travel led to high demand for cargo ships. Haulers were first created simply by bolting a cockpit and engine block onto a cargo container, and the basic design has not changed much since then."

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. Its on-board gearing allows it to service even the most primitive colonies, though dock workers in busier spaceports often joke that it would be simpler to carry smaller freighters within its gigantic holds."
	description "	It is also an incredibly slow and difficult to maneuver ship, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of Bulk Freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description "The Container Transport is a newer, more popular configuration of the Bulk Freighter that replaces the outboard loose cargo holds with intermodal containers for more efficient turnaround in larger, better-equipped ports."
	description "	As with its geared cousin, however, it remains a slow and difficult to maneuver ship, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of Container Transports just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Container Transport to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."
