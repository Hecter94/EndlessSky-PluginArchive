	description "During experimentation Gemsun discovered that reversing the Hyperphase Loop resulted in more energy generation and cooling, but came at a loss of energy suspension."
	description "	Because of the fear of mishandling the dangerous method by civilians the Algol limited the sale only to Navy vessels."

	description "Gemsun's HpL Energy Suspender, or just Energy Suspender for short, uses a Hyperphase Loop to provide a considerable amount of energy suspension. This comes with side-effects like causing the temperature outside the eye to drop allowing it to cool its surroundings, or interfering with radar and scan systems."
	description "	After generations of refining the process the method now also generates small amounts of energy and heat, which in turn has caused the phasing out of conventional nucleovoltaic generators in Algol ships."
