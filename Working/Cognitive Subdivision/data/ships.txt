	description "Acecast's introductory model was set with one goal in mind: design a ship that can handle anything. The Scarab Moth gained a positive reputation for the company amongst several merchants, rookie and veteran, and to this day is considered a success. With enough cargo space to match a World Hauler Dyd, and more than enough space for bunks and outfits. To top it all off, it even has enough room for 2 massive turrets, for those merchants that really want to be ready for any situation."
