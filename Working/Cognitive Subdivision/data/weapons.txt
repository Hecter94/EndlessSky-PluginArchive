	description `Hyperphase technology first saw use in systems like Hyperdrives and power generators. It wasn't until the "Kije Rebellion" that the technology would be used in weapons. The HpV gun was the first weapon to do so and till this day has proven that Hyperphase technology can be quite deadly in the battlefield.`
