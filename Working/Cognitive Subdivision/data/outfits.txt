	description `Because of the large power needs of the Algol Navy's destroyers, Gemsun was given the task to provide the Navy with a more powerful generator for its size. Gemsun delivered and introduced the "Reverse Hyperphase Loop 2 Carat Core".`

	description "During experimentation Gemsun discovered that reversing the Hyperphase Loop resulted in more energy generation and cooling, but came at a loss of energy suspension."
	description "	To help combat the extra heat produced by the new method Gemsun added a small active cooling system. Because of the fear of mishandling the dangerous method by civilians the Algol limited the sale only to Navy vessels."

	description "Gemsun's HpL Energy Suspender, or just Energy Suspender for short, uses a Hyperphase Loop to provide a considerable amount of energy suspension. This comes with side-effects like causing the temperature outside the eye to drop allowing it to cool its surroundings, or interfering with radar and scan systems."
	description "	After generations of refining the process the method now also generates small amounts of energy and heat, which in turn has caused the phasing out of conventional nucleovoltaic generators in Algol ships."

	description "The Tunneler Ramscoop by Ridgetime is the reason why fuel pods have become phased out off Algol vessels. Its use of energy and "tunneling" rhythm to capture more of the solar winds, makes it extremely powerful."

	description "Because of the popularity of the Energy Suspender amongst Algol ships, the Algol Navy developed a scanner with less rate of failure in order to weed out smugglers after the War of Incognition."
	description "	Although the war has long since been over, the current raids by an unforeseen force have sparked paranoia amongst most Algol, and so the Navy has once again outfitted their ships with the scanner."

	description "The nanobots in Lucentbit's O-Su PR (Outfit-Setup Pico Reassembler) contain smaller picobots used for precise injections in different areas of a ship; allowing maximum efficiency when converting cargo space to outfit space."
	description "	This modification comes at a high cost of less cooling efficiency."

	description "Seeking more modability in their ships, the Algol Navy has developed a working shield generator that can function in most ships with room for it."
	description "	This shield generator also allowed for more changes to its structure, which makes it more powerful and resistant than its built in counterparts."
