	description `Cargo drones are the inevitable result of finding an answer to the question "How can we move modest amounts of cargo at minimal cost?" Consisting of little more than a frame, control computer, a cargo container, solar collection panels and a drive unit, more or less the only flexibility in this minimalistic design is that the designers left enough room to precariously bolt on a hyperdrive.`
	description "Almost hilariously vulnerable to piracy, cargo drones are seldom deployed solo, instead gathering in gaggles to follow a control ship like ducklings after their mother."

	description "The Freighter is designed by the Syndicate to be an efficient means of carrying cargo from system to system, but is so slow and difficult to land that most pilots hate flying them - not to mention it renders them sitting ducks if unescorted."
	description "	That simply wouldn't do for Lightspeed Logistics Solutions, who decided the most economical way to keep their fleets safe but efficient was to design an aftermarket upgrade package for the standard freighter. Implemented in a specialized shipyard adjoined to their headquarters, the Merchantman upgrade adds more speed, more gun, and more armor to an otherwise unthreatening vessel. While you certainly wouldn't want to fly one into battle, these vessels are now more than capable of safely running away from one."
	description "	Key modifications to the hull include a reduction in living quarters and cargo space in order to make room for increased fuel reserves and the increased space needed by the ship's engines and weapons. Armor plating has also been fastened stood-off from the hull, the better to absorb impacts without risking the integrity of precious cargo."

	description "As it turns out, long-range exploration vessels from the early days of space travel make for rather good cargo vessels. Harkening from an era where one had to worry more about unmapped spacelanes and less about pirates, the Fluyt sports thick armor, capacious fuel tanks, and a rather pathetic shielding array. Perhaps more notably is the assortment of drone bays, making it a popular option for routine shipping operations where landing is either infeasible or simply not efficient - which happens more often than many captains would like."
	description "The fluyt is a monumentally sluggish vessel, built far more for endurance and reliability than maneuverability.

	description "The Bulk Freighter is the ultimate cargo ship, able to carry as much cargo as four ordinary Syndicate Freighters. It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to maneuver, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description `The headquarters of Lightspeed Logistic Solutions appear architecturally disjointed, two incongruous designs welded together into a functional, if aesthetically incompatible station-hull. One side of the station is a massive shipment processing center, drab, utilitarian, and boasting a constant stream of cargo vessels coming and going. The other half, hosting corporate administration and headquarters, is the sort of fever-dream construction only available to spaceborne architects: soaring, gleaming structures built more for function than form, and clearly designed to impress upon any onlookers the importance of whatever business may happen within. Gone here are the swarms of freighters and cargo drones that throng the processing center, replaced instead by luxury shuttles that flit between small hangars studding the twisted, gleaming towers.`
