planet Clink
	attributes mining moon
	landscape land/desert3
	description `About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air.`
	description `	The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships.`

planet "Laki Nemparu"
	attributes korath efret
	landscape land/sea2
	description `This is an old factory world, so shrouded in smog that only tiny glimpses of the land are visible from above. Deep under the oceans of Laki Nemparu are oil reservoirs so vast that centuries of industry have not yet drained them dry. All but the hardiest of the native vegetation and wildlife is now long extinct from lack of direct sunlight or from pollution and chemical exposure.`
	spaceport `All the Korath you encounter in the spaceport are wearing ventilator masks, and if you were staying here for longer you would probably do the same. The air leaves a metallic taste in your mouth, and your eyes feel dry and sting when the wind hits them. On the outskirts of the city, factory smokestacks are belching more pollution into the air; the Korath have either given up on preserving this planet, or simply have too great a need for the goods manufactured here to be willing to shut the factories down.`
