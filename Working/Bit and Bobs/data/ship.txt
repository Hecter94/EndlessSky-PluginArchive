	description `The watchdog is an upgraded version of the protector. Much like the last edition, the Watchdog is most useful for escorts, and is usually best in short range.`

	description "This is arguably the most powerful combat ship ever built by humans (if it was built by humans). Two large, hollow chuncks of hull have been welded to the cetner, and are used as cargo holds. The drone bays have been filled in by outfits, and it seems some parts have been laced with nuclear missles, which are rigged to explode when the ship takes too much damage. Despite it's origins, this ship was a flagship; all the other members of it's fleet existed to disable ships so that this cruiser could steal their cargo and outfits. It also still has the bunks, and is more than prepared to board a ship if it appeals to the captain."
