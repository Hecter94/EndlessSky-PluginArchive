	description "While the Energy Blaster is probably the single cheapest and thus most common weapon in human space, it's also the weakest. The Dual Blaster solves this problem in the simplest possible manner; It is simply two Energy Blasters slightly modified to fit into one housing and thereby take up one gun port. It does everything two blasters can do, and precisely nothing more."
