			`When you walk into the spaceport Rek greets you and asks you to join him in a meeting. He leads you to a conference room where Ambassador Sayari and several Wanderers in uniform are discussing a star map projected from the table.`
			`	They look up as you walk in and one of the commanders calls you over. "Captain <last>, she begins, "We are [discussing, pondering] the source of the Unfettered jump drives." She points to a star system to the right of Ehma Ti. "We know they must come through this [area, region] of space, since they cannot travel through Hai territory.`
			`	"There are, of course, problems with us [gaining access, travelling] to those systems," She says and  rustles her feathers in a gesture approximating a shrug, "but even if we had access, we can only [evaluate, inspect] a ship by disabiling and boarding it. Ambassador Sayari had indicated that the Hai have [inspectors, scanners] that can [discover, probe] and ship at a distance, but had no technical details. We hope that you would be able to tell us more."`

So far, we and the Navy are not shooting at each other, because no one wants to fire the first shot. But if they're getting ready to change that, they'll start refitting their Cruisers with heavy weaponry instead of surveillance equipment. So, I need to know how many more of their ships are equipped like the one you just scanned."`
