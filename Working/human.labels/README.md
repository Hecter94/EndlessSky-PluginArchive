### human.labels
<br>
<br>
Reworks the Human area labels and adds area borders. See the readme for details.<br>
<br>
The area labels of Human space are now smaller and better to see. Also there is a border drawn around each area.<br>
On Earth's job board you can find a mission to change the color of the labels(light blue, light gray, yellow, dark red, green, dark gray, orange, purple).<br>
