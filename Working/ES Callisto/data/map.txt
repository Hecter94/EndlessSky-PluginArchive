	description "In the early days of humanity as a spacefaring species, Callisto was a major base. Its low gravity, water ice, and remote location made it a perfect base and communications outpost, as well as being of interest to scientists. In 2197, however, a band of extremists used nuclear weapons on the moon, centred around the primary base. These weapons caused serious damage, and rendered the moon uninhabitable for decades. Rather than clean it up, the base was abandoned, and no one has ever tried to colonize it since."
	description "	The Navy does occasionally patrol and scan Callisto to make sure no pirates are trying to set up a base on it, but other than that very few people ever come here."
	spaceport "All that remains of the ancient spaceport is a massive crater where the largest bomb, a 320 megaton explosive, was dropped. The geiger counter in your suit claims that the crater is about as hot as a bannana, but it's still a frightening reminder of what can happen when nuclear weapons are used."
	spaceport "Since the attack, nuclear weapons have been outlawed entirely by international accord for more than eight hundred years. Radicals have occasionally used them, and they were used by some corporations during the Turf Wars, but anyone caught by the Republic selling nuclear weaponry these days will spend the rest of their life in prison."
