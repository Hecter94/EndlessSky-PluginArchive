			'	You listen in on their conversation while casually scrutinizing your steering thrusters.'
			'	Merchant Captain: "I'm telling you I know what I saw, the creature destroyed a pirate vessel right in front of me."'
			'	Shuttle Repairman: "Sure and I saw Bigfoot on Dagobah."'
			'	Merchant Captain: "Fine then, if you don't believe me go see for your self, but don't say I didn't warn you!" he says and storms off walking past you.'
			'	Stop the captain as he goes by?'

			choice

			'	You: "Hey, I couldn't help but overhear, did you say you saw some sort of creature?"'
			'	Merchant Captain: *sigh* "sure laugh at me if you want, but I feel like its my duty to warn people, Yes I saw some sort of incredibly large insect like creature out on the edge of syndicate space, it destroyed a pirate fleet incredibly quickly and I didn't see its shields drop a bit."'
			'	You: "I think I may know what your talking about. I've met such creatures before and their called "Archons" they don't interfere with humans much though."'
			'	Merchant Captain: "Well It definitely was "interfering" the thing locked weapons onto me and I think that, if I hadn't already been warping away, I wouldn't be speaking to you now."'
			'You: "That doesn't sound like them at all, what was that system? I would like to check it out for my self."'
			'	Merchant Captain: "Gamma Cassiopeia, but if you have any sense at all you will stay far away from there."'
			'	Merchant Captain: walks away* muttering "whats the galaxy coming to with giant cyborg spiders wrecking havoc..."'

				'The Archon says, "Why have you returned?"'
				choice
				'	"I have reason to believe that the syndicates have captured one of your kind and may be studying it."'
				'	"I have found a syndicate station that may be holding an Archon captive."'
				goto inquiry

				'	"I want to know why one of you is working with the syndicates."'

				label inquiry
				'	The Archon says, "It is not possible for a human to capture one of us. Your concern is appreciated but un-nessecary."'
				choice
				'	"Are you certain? I had a merchant captain tell me reciently that a creature which sounded a lot like one of your ships almost attacked him arround Gamma Cassiopeia."'
				'	"O.K. but their is a syndicate station holding some large creature in the Gamma Cassiopeia system."'
					goto draktell

				label  suspicious
				'	The Archon says, "What possible interest would we have in working with one of the human factions?"'
				choice

				'	"I had a merchant captain tell me reciently that a creature which sounded a lot like one of your ships attacked him arround Gamma Cassiopeia."'
				'	"Their is a syndicate station that I think is harboring one of your ships in the Gamma Cassiopeia system."'
					goto draktell

				label draktell
				'	The Archon replies, "Gamma Cassiopeia... As you know we communicate telipathically. Some of us have reciently felt a mind that seemed like of our kind but much weaker than normal eminating from that system... As if it were an infant reaching out to us from its dreams. Perhaps their is some validity to your claims. Let us view the station as you saw it."'

				'	You suddently remember every detail of the Gamma Cassiopeia station. Details you had not noticed before now are apparent from the stitching on the mercenaries uniforms to the structure of the station. You realize the obvious conclution and don't understand how you could not have seen it before, the syndicates must have obtained a sample of Archon DNA and have cloned it. As soon as you come to this conclution you feel the memories recede and you are left with a feeling of emptyness.'

				'	You anounce to the Archon, "The syndicates must have obtained a sample of your species DNA and managed to clone an Archon."'

				'	The Archon replies, "Yes obtaining a sample would not be incredibly difficult as we shed cells frequently. It is surprising that at human levels of technology they would be able to clone the body of one of us. This may be their greatest accomplishment if they can sucessfully pair our biotech with their systems. Even without our cybernetic technology our ships are capable of tremendious energy and shield generation and have a self repairing hull. This could change the balance of power in the syndicates favor. You should be very concerned."'

				choice

				'	"Wait arn't you going to help? It is your DNA after all."'
				'	"Its one of your race, don't you care what happens to it?"'
				'	"This seems like more of a Drak problem than mine."'

				'	The Archon says, "Whatever it is, it is not one of us. It is an abomination and will never achieve conchiousness. If it lives, it will be forever on lifesupport, used solely for its bio-technology."'
