	description "This was the seat of government and last military stronghold of the Kor Mereti faction during the Korath civil war. Here they built the factories and shipyards that churned out autonomous warships to prosecute their war against the Kor Sestor. The machines now rule this world alone, and have made it entirely uninhabitable for living creatures as they delve ever deeper into the planet's crust to harvest metal and fuel, and construct more and more factories to build new generations of robotic warships."
	spaceport "With no living creatures in sight, the only noises in this refueling depot are the roaring engines as robot ships land and take off, communicating silently with each other via radio. The autonomous ships land and take off with perfect precision in a steady, unbroken stream. Many of them have been damaged by weapons fire, and as soon as they land they are covered by a swarm of welding and repair microbots that lay down new layers of hull armor and rebuild weapons and engines that have been destroyed."
