	description "Once a smooth and elegant ship, what appears to be an Osprey has been rearranged and reshaped to be even deadlier than before. Its plating has been thickened and lined with more shield emitters, its engine mounts expanded to accomodate more atomic engines, and a whole new gun port makes it almost as powerful as a lower-class Heavy Warship."

	description "Once a smooth and elegant ship, what appears to be an Osprey has been rearranged and reshaped to be even deadlier than before. Its plating has been thickened and lined with more shield emitters. Other features incorporated into this design include a new gun port, a slimmer body reducing drag, and an entire new engine mount salvaged from a separate Osprey, making it nearly one of the fastest medium warships in human space."
