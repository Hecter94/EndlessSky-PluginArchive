A few months ago we started eradicating these insects with a tailor-made virus and are now completely successful with that. Colonization can now begin.

I must admit that the investment is significant, but our analysts assured me that the first distribution of profits will occur after 1 to 1.5 years, and pay off after about 3 years."`
