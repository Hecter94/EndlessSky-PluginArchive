### galactic.capital.investment <br>
<br>
Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 1 billion credits.<br>
<br>
At 1 billion credits cash a longer mission chain starts and enables a reapeatable job board investment of 1 billion credits. The chain has some breaks and finishes after a year.<br>
There is also a job to deposit and withdraw credits, but at a much lower interest rate. And the same job offers to deposit and withdraw to a family trust, which can be accessed by all your saves/pilots (but without interest).<br>
<br>
Job board investments:(if enabled)<br>
1 million = 274 credits daily (12% chance) (10% interest p.a.)<br>
5 million = 1,520 credits daily (10% chance) (11% interest p.a.)<br>
10 million = 3,287 credits daily (8% chance) (12% interest p.a.)<br>
50 million = 17,808 credits daily (6% chance) (13% interest p.a.)<br>
100 million = 38,356 credits daily (4% chance) (14% interest p.a.)<br>
1 billion = 410,958 credits daily (2% chance) (15% interest p.a.)<br>
<br>
