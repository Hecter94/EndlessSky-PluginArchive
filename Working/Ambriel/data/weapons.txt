	description "The X5700 thruster is intended for only the largest of capital ships. When the Syndicate first began producing them, these engines were considered little more than a publicity stunt, because no ship at the time was large enough to hold one. This one has been modified to allow reverse thrusting."
	description "	Ion engines consume less energy than plasma engines and produce less heat, but they also take up more space."
