For ships with little cooling capabilities, it is devastating, and can mean certain death, but capital ships are still at risk of ambush while shut down."

The residual magnetic field around the projectile allows it to puncture any shield, but not before the projectile slows down quite a bit."

Most pilots still took on the Heavy laser over two beam lasers, simply because of the range increase, despite the fact that the damage was not quite doubled. To remedy that, The galaxy was presented with the Dual Beam lasers, a stepping stone between Heavy Lasers and Beam Lasers."
