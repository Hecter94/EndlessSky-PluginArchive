The Reborne helped the Alphas during the Alpha War, and are helping the Alphas now. Unfortunately, our path back was blocked by the Reborne's invasion fleets. The galaxy is falling into genetically altered chaos again, and it is our duty to fix this. Right now, Two other Generals from the West Iron security fleet are giving the exact same speech to the Syndicate, and although you may not trust them, we must, if we are to be victorious."`
			`		"I will be in the spaceport if you wish to help, rather than cower in your territory. You have 12 hours until I contact the other Generals to say that the Free Worlds have refused to help their fellow man. That is all."`

			`		"Ah, Its good to have this place back. I'm sure the republic won't mind if we use this place as our base of operations, don't worry, this is a factory, so we should be able to get our weapons and ships pumping out for the war soon enough." says Gregor, as you walk out of the hangar. "I think a payment is in order, for all your help. It probably isn't much compared to what you were earning before all this, but its all I'm authorized to give to hired help."`
			`		He hands you <payment> credits and heads off for the command center.`
			`		"Meet me in the Spaceport in a few hours after I get this place ready." He shouts back to you.`

			`		You enter the station's spaceport, Gregor is waiting, supervising the construction of the new warships.`
			`		"Ah good, Captain <last>, you've arrived just in time to see the handiwork of our production line." he says`
			`		"Very impressive, I remember a few years ago it took weeks to produce a single Dreadnought, and here you are, building the largest warships in the galaxy in mere days." you say, in awe.`
			`		"Unfortunately, its not fast enough. But we need to strike now before the rebuild," he says "Now, the plan. Today's plan involves a lot of luck, that the Reborne haven't rebuilt their strike force since our assault on this system. We'll be taking on Arcturus and Alioth first, then plugging the hole with Rutilicus. Reinforcements will be coming in soon."`
			`		"Will I be doing this alone?" you ask.`
			`		"Don't worry, there will be Free Worlds and Republic fleets there when you arrive, with the bonus of any locals who could escape beforehand." he replies.`

			`You step off of your ship to a crowd of celebrating spaceport workers, all cheering for you and your fleet.`
			`	"Don't let it go to your head, Captain. We still have many more battles ahead." Gregor says, as he weaves through of the crowd. "There isn't much place to talk strategy out there, so lets convene on your ship, while the crews are celebrating still having their lives after that last battle." Gregor goes to your communications first and calls the other Generals who went to the Syndicate. "Hogan, Valstog! Good to see you two alive still. How did your visit to the Syndicate go?"`
			`	"It took longer than expected, but the Syndicate are willing to help. They are gathering their forces in Delta Capricorni and Formalhaut, we are preparing to strike Altair and Deneb whenever you are ready." Hogan says.`
			`	"Begin your assault, we will meet your forces in Vega." Gregor responds, Captain <last>, we will be making a push through Menkent into Vega, we won't be landing in Menkent though, we don't want to give the enemy in Vega any time to prepare. I already contacted the West Iron fleet in Regulus, they will be working with the Republic to clean up the north. Once we are all in position, we will be doing a combined assault on Sol, hopefully ending the Reborne and Alpha threat for good."`
