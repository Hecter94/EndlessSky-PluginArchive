This plugin is meant to allow you to complete Endless Sky story lines without doing things you have an ethical problem with. For now, it just makes it so you don't need to drop a bomb on Zenith and kill civilians.

If you'd rather grind then use a plugin, you can cap a bunch of Korath ships in Kor Ak'Mari and destroy the Sestor fleet that way.

# Using the Plugin

Park any escort ships you don't want to lose in Hai space. Make sure you have a cloaking device on your flagship.

Destroy any hostiles above Farpoint before you land. DON'T LOSE ANY WARDRAGONS.

After talking to Danforth, cloak and hide. Run away. Come back and distract single sestor ships on the edges. Cloak fast and stay on the edges.

If you take the Quarg ships anywhere but Farpoint the mission will fail and you'll have to start over.

If you want to farm Coalition or Quarg reputation, try this plugin: https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War
