			`	You have barely started your meal at a cafe table when you notice Dawn waving at you. "Hello, Captain <last>! Would you be interested in going on another research expedition?"`
			choice
				`	"Of course! Where do you need to go?"`
				`	"Sorry, I'm busy right now."`
					defer
			`	"This study will actually require an expedition to two different stars, but the first is quite close by: Caeculus. We may have to remain there for some time, but what we observe should be quite exciting.`
			choice
				`	"What exactly will we be observing?"`
					goto massejection
				`	"Exciting? I'm not sure I like the sound of that."`
			`	"Oh, it won't be dangerous if we keep our distance. This should be far safer than the expedition to Sagittarius A*, and for this first star we'll be right next door to the capital in case of any emergencies. Afterward, we will need to journey to Ildaria, in Ancestral space, so help should likewise be available."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, you've convinced me. What will we be watching, anyway?"`
					goto massejection
			label massejection
			`	Her eyes light up as she animately begins explaining "As you've probably noticed by now, the Ember Waste is filled with dead and dying stars, relics of an age long past. However, Remnant scientists have been puzzled for centuries by the fact that the age of these stars does not match the astrophysical models we brought over from Ancestral space– based on those models, these stars are all far too young to produce novae, or too small to go supernova. So, we want to compare two stars at similar states in their stellar evolution: one inside the Ember Waste, and one in the wider galaxy."`
			`	"In order to most accurately record their internal structures, we want to observe a coronal mass ejection event for each one– this should be enough to establish the accuracy of our models, or perhaps point towards some hidden phenomenon present in the Ember Waste to explain the disparity. "`
			`	"I can explain more during the flight, if you wish. You do still have a research laboratory installed, right?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, of course!"`
				`	"I can have one installed right now."`
			`	You follow Dawn out of the cafeteria and to the spaceport, where you prepare for departure.`

			`	As soon as you arrive, Dawn quickly sets up the laboratory, setting up her intstruments before joining you in the cockpit. "It may take some time for a coronal mass ejection event to occur, so we may be here for a while."`
			
			`	"You may also wish to keep your distance from the star, as we have lost ships –and scientists– to their damaging effects before," she adds in a more somber tone.`

		dialog `The star flares bright against your cockpit windows, which automatically darken to protect your fragile eyes from its deadly rays. At first, the light seems to dim, but within moments you watch a wave of incandescent plasma paint the space before you. Intellectually, you know that you are safe behind your ship's shields and armor, but the grand scale and majesty of the ejection puts all else to shame. Several minutes pass in silence as you both watch the swirling currents of plasma outside. You and Dawn nearly jump out of your seats as the laboratory equipment loudly chimes, signalling that it has collected the required data. You can now go on to Ildaria to observe a coronal mass ejection there.`

			`	Again, Dawn sets up the laboratory equipment before taking her seat. "We can learn a lot by measuring the frequency of the CMEs in each system. Remote observations show that they're less frequent here, but this expedition should give us much more accurate measurements."`

			`	"Remember, straying too close to the star when the ejection event starts could be hazardous."`

Is it just your imagination, or is this a less violent and energetic ejection than the one in the Ember Waste? You ponder on in silence before the laboratory equipment chimes, signalling that it you can now return to <destination> with the data.`

			`	The journey back is uneventful, though you have gained some newfound appreciation for the relative serenity of most star systems. "So, how long will it take before you'll have answers?" you ask. "We can't be sure," says Dawn. "After all, we've been observing these stars for centuries. It is hoped that data outside the Ember Waste will give us a more useful control point, but even if we do identify something wrong with the local stars, it could be years or even decades before we know what exactly changed them."`
			choice
				`	"Do you think it could have something to do with the ion storms?"`
					goto storms
				`	"Could the same event have created the unstable wormholes?"`
					goto wormholes
			label storms
			`	It is certainly possible. There is a large flow of energy being poured into the surrounding nebulae, and the source –whatever it may be– has been active for eons. Who knows what kind of effect it may have had on these stars, millions of years ago?"`
			label wormholes
			`	That is one possibility. Whoever formed the unstable wormholes –and we are nearly certain that they are artificial– would easily have the power to alter or even destroy entire stars. While this is one of the more unlikely possibilities, it may be the case, which would be... concerning, to say the least.`
