			`	"After a turbulent point in Earths History known as 'World War Two,' two of the worlds primary powers began what is known as the space race. Although many interesting things happened during this time period, we will begin our story in the year 2080.`
			`	In the year two-thousand and eighty, the first human settlement on a new world was founded. Mars, being relatively close to Earth, was selected for habitation. The colony was successful, and served as proof of concept for colonization of new worlds. Twenty years later, the first permanent settlement on Luna was founded using many of the same technologies developed during early Martian colonization. `
			`	The Lunar Colony became a shipyard, still in use today. Fifty years after its founding, a sizable fleet of generation ships using nuclear sub-light-speed propulsion managed to colonize the first planet outside of the Sol system, Chiron in the Alpha Centauri system."`

			`	"During the Twenty-Two Hundreds there was an unprecedented explosion in exploration and colonization. This all began with the first Hyperdrive. `
			`	In the years before Twenty-Two Ten, a physicist named Charles Plot discovers charged particles traveling along a 'gravitational slipstream' between the Sun and Alpha Centauri. That year, he perfects a device that can travel along these gravitational pathways. Known as the Plot Device, this invention allows mass colonization of the systems near Earth.`
			`	By the year 2300, colonies have extended not just near Earth, but as far as Valhalla and Midgard. Interstellar trade has become viable, and corporations are taking advantage of the wealth of the stars."`

			`	"In the year Twenty-three Twenty, a few small scout ships were exploring the southern galactic rim near what is now known as Tarazed. That is where came across the only sentient extra terrestrial species we have been in contact with to this day. Beings known as the 'Quarg.'`
			`	Although many humans were threatened by the vast technological superiority of these aliens, they became an invaluable resource. Admittedly not forth-coming with their knowledge, they have told us that there are indeed other technologically advanced alien beings within our galaxy. They have provided lease to a couple of permanent human settlements in their region, including Humanika and Wayfarer.`
			`	Still to this day, the shipyards in Tarazed study the Quarg, who have continued to trade with us and assist in peace keeping in the Southern Rim."`

			`	"Although it is unclear when the Dark Ages truly began, historians can agree that the collapse into war started somewhere between the years Twenty-thee Eighty and Twenty-Four Ten. As Corporations became more powerful than world governments with larger fleets and militias. Governing Corporate Entities controlled most of known space, and with their seemingly endless resources and complete lack of regulation they had begun fighting amongst each other.`
			`	During this tis time, countless 'turf wars' broke out between rivals. Starting as small as single mining ships fighting dueling in empty space, and escalating to complete brawling matches between massive fleets using genetically engineered super soldiers to do their bidding.
			`	By Twenty-Four Fourty-Five, enough of these genetically engineered super soldiers were created to pose a serious threat to all of humanity, and less than five years later they realized it during an era known as 'The First Alpha War.'`
			`	Only with technologically advanced ships and weapons from the Deep was humanity finally able to drive back the Alphas. However, this was not the end of the conflict. After the Alphas were driven back, a second set of Turf Wars began. It's only when the Deep begins sending out caravans that the Dark Ages end and a new Era begins."`

			`	"As early as Twenty-Six Eighteen, the Deep begins sending out large fleets of well defended trade caravans, marking the beginning of what historians call the 'Caravan Era'`
			`	During this time, smaller corporate entities in the Core begin consolidating under the banner of the Syndicate. Although it has not yet been established as a true government, the framework has been laid for them as well as what will eventually become the Republic.`
			`	In the year 2730, the Republic is formed with Earth as its seat of government. It begins using its key location to pressure the other governing bodies, including the Syndicate, Paradise Worlds, and Deep to join them. By 2760 all the governments excluding the Deep and some smaller pirate worlds have joined the Republic. Thirty years later, the government of the Deep agrees to partner with the Republic, bringing all of human civilization under the rule of one government."`
