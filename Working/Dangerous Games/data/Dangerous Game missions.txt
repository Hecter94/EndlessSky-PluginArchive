			`	The moment you pass through the spaceport bar's door, a strong drink is pressed into your hand. You look at it, dumbfounded, and then look up to the waiter who gave it to you. "Compliments of Mr. Karengo," he says, nodding his head towards a crowd of people, mostly young men, before moving on. As you make your way over, you note that everyone in the bar has the same drink you do. In the middle of the crowd, a large, heavily muscled and tatooed man is gesticulating wildly, apparently telling a story.` 
			`	"...so then he says to me, he says, have you ever ridden one? And I look back at this crazy joithead and I say, you're a crazy joithead. But he's got me thinking, y'know? Nobody has ever ridden one. Least, not nobody that could talk after." He lets out a laugh. "So I ask you all; who wants to join Karengo to make history? Who wants to ride a dragon?"` 
			`	You've heard the stories of the dragons of Skymoot as a child; great beasts that control the skies, astonishingly similar to the dragons of lore. The galaxy is host to many dangerous creatures, but these living myths hold a special place near the top of that list.`
			`	A cheer goes up from the men, especially the drunk ones, and "Mr. Karengo" starts to hand out death and accident waivers and collect money for the expedition. Suddenly, his face changes. "Listen up!" he yells, "Seems my regular pilot got in the way of a pirate fleet, and my replacement pilot misplaced his balls this evening and can't find 'em! So we need ourselves a ship and a captain! Who's ready to pay for their drink?"`

			`Eventually, they find another captain and stumble off into the night.`

			`	You wake up significantly after dawn with empty bottles and unconscious men strewn all over your ship. Karengo gives you a crooked smile, shielding his eyes from the light. "Alright, <last>," he says, "let's do this."`

			`	Karengo guides you down through the atmosphere of Skymoot, steering clear of the usual tourist areas and, you realize, of the local law enforcement. As you're putting down in a clearing halfway up a mountain, there's an otherworldly screech and your ship lurches violently to one side. If you hadn't been strapped in, you would surely have been thrown to the floor.` 
			`	"Look lively, boys!" Karengo is the only person still standing. "Your chariot awaits!" In short order, he double-checks the jetpacks on the backs of each of the men, or "Dragonriders", as they creatively branded themselves during their first night of the voyage. Karengo opens the side hatch and hurls the Dragonriders out the door before following himself. You land and pull up every external camera you have to watch the action.` 
			`	The dragons of Skymoot you saw as a kid were different from the dragons of mythology, but the beasts you see today aren't quite the same ones you remember learning about on "The Xenofauna Channel", either. For one, the creatures outside your window are largely invisible - a trick of the way the light reflects around the scales on their hides. They are faster, too, or perhaps the ones on "Xenofauna" had been drugged to make them easier to film. A quick survey of the scene shows that Karengo has tagged three dragons with some sort of paintball gun to make them easier to track. Eight of the Dragonriders are chasing the largest one, which is missing part of a tooth and has some blackened scales from where it hit your shield. The last Dragonrider is nowhere in sight.` 
			`	Suddenly, proximity sensors go off on the starboard side and a camera shows something - or someone - bounce off your shield and tumble down the mountainside.`

			`	Upon closer inspection, the object rolling down the hill is indeed a body. You turn away and back to the monitors, where one of the Dragonriders is keeping just above a dragon, attempting to lower himself down. The dragon rolls in midair, its wing catching the man and sending him flying. Fortunately for him, a leafy tree branch prevents any further physical harm. Meanwhile, a second dragon is pursuing another Dragonrider.`

			`	The ship takes off with a roar at your touch. Between the cries of the dragons, the sound of the engines, and the air rushing past, you can barely hear the fear and betrayel in the voices of the men you've left behind.`
				goto end


			label go
			`	You turn on the PA system. "WE ARE LEAVING," you blast to the survivors, "GET ON BOARD."`

			`	The defeated Dragonriders need no further encouragement. They beeline for the hatch and you drop a section of the shield to let them through, where they collapse, wide-eyed and panting. Karengo isn't with them. You turn to ask about him, when a flicker of motion on a monitor catches your eye.` 
			`	Karengo is there, and he's riding a dragon, gripping the ridge of scales around its neck. The dragon is frantically trying to get him off, but creative application of his jetpack is, for now, keeping him on top of the beast. He lets out wild whoops of triumph as they soar through the sky and at last you can understand the appeal of this whole mission. Your admiration is cut short by two catastrophic crashes on either side of the ship and accompanying sirens. The dragons are trying to get through.` 

			choice
				`	(swear and take off)`
					goto pignuts
				`	(just take off)`
					goto takeoff

			label pignuts
			`	"Pignuts," you mutter to yourself.`

			label takeoff
			`	The ship takes off quickly enough to make you temporarily light-headed. "GET ON!" a Dragonrider shouts over the PA as you position the ship just below the raging dragon with Karengo attached. Scales bounce off the roof like diamonds. He lets go of his death grip on the dragon and free falls toward you, only slowing at the last possible moment before dropping through the top hatch. You hit the engines hard and they respond enthusiastically, rocketing you away from the mountain and into the safety of patrolled airspace. From the cabin comes the sound of back-slapping and, surprisingly, a sob.` 
			`	As you fuel up, Karengo herds the seven surviving men out of the ship. "Meet us at the spaceport tonight, yeah?" he says to you. "This day deserves a celebration." You nod, but can't help but notice red eyes and wet cheeks among the rest of the Dragonriders as they shuffle off.`

"We were just raising a glass to mission success - made possible by you, of course. Great flying, brother." The bartender arrives with a round of drinks and Karengo raises one.
