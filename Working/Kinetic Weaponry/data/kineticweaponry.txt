	description "A weapon tried and proven since the beginning of modern warfare in the late 20th century, kinetic weapons were the primary armament of most militaries for hundreds of years, even after the invention of the blaster. In the late 2700's they finally began to become less common than the energy weapons of the time. Still, that didn't end its popularity with certain individuals, as recent developments in shield technology began to show increasing protection against conventional laser weapons, and kinetic shells' incredible shield-piercing capeabilities are showing new possibilities in ship-to-ship combat. This variation of kinetic shell cannon fires a HEAT-FS, or HEATFS shell, standing for High-Explosive-Anti-Tank, Fin-Stablized. It is a shell that saw used from the mid-20th century during the 'Cold War' conflict of the time. Even though the anti-ship version doesn't usually see combat against ground armored vehicles, its designation was never changed from 'Anti-Tank,' possibly because of the historical meaning, or possibly for ease of use of the term. The shell is stabilized by four 'fins,' which are really simply small thrusters that keep the shell stabilized during flight. The principles it works on are quite simple, it is a normal explosive round, that redirects a certain amount of force during its explosion into a small armor-piercing projectile that is quickly accelerated to incredible velocities, penetrating through most shields and into the hull of the target. It also possesses the added advantage of the large explosion preceding the submunition's strike blowing a small temporary hole in the shields of the enemy ship, enabling the submunition to penetrate with even greater ease."

	description "A HEAT-FS shell is a high explosive shell that has been converted to a shaped charge that is incredibly good at piercing armor, and doing damage simultaneously to surrounding shields, giving it a slight advantage over APFSDS rounds. This is ammunition for a Kinetic Turret."

	description `A subcaliber projectile, fired with inserts that enable it to fit into a larger shell, thus putting a massive amount of energy into a relatively small projectile, propelling it forwards at speeds exceeding 1800 m/s, or above Mach 5. The only downside to these shells is the low shield damage output, as the simply make a tiny hole in the shields that usually can immediately regenerate. This is ammunition for a Kinetic Turret.`
		`	A common joke about these shells is that humanity has simply "gone back to throwing arrows at each other."`
