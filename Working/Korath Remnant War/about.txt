This mod is all about allowing a player to have access to the korath world ship which now is allowed to spawn inside the remnant worlds, all i did was make it is the korath home fleets spawn at half the rate of raids.... my first plugin so don't enjoy


ORRR so that was the case... then i said f*** it and wanted to see the world burn..... now im making it a war between the karate and remnant and starting to have fun making it... this is still a s*** mod and well...while im trying to make it even slightly balanced.... well...it has as much balance as my diet choices.... which are well.....also in need of updating :P . so yolo enjoy, please end it all thats all i ask, I'm been kidnapped by santa and being held in a sweat shop please send help... i beg you


update: 0.4.1
