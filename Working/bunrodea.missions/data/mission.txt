			`While landing on <planet>, you noticed some stuttering coming from the engines. You decide to take a deeper look into the engines.`
			`A young Bunrodea with a unusual colourful hat approaches, hands you one of the translating devices, and starts to speak immediately.`
			`You turn the device on "... to be having problems with the rotator splint. The engine runs good now, but not for long."`
			`"Anyway," he pulls out a computer pad and starts reading "On behalf of our queen 'Shinuxa va Ang, third broodmother of Thshu, protector of Bunthro', you are allowed to proof your worth to the Bunrodea Empire."`
			`"Our territorial integrity gets tested by the Korath. Although these invaders mean no threat to us, letting an outsider handle them will show the Korath that they will have to fight on several frontiers if they ever decide to go beyond weak raids."`
			`"Travel to Era Natta and destroy the Korath presence." without waiting for your answer the Bunrodean walks away.`

			`As far as you can tell, the same young Bunrodea already awaits you after the landing. He pulls out his pad again and starts reading.`

Further proofs of worth to the Bunrodea Empire will result in higher earning of trust." he puts back the pad and walks away.`
			`You think about the advantages you can get by buying a Bunrodea warship, once your reputation with them is high enough. And you have your own translation device now!`

			`Like on all your previous meetings, he doesn't wait for a response and just walks away. You aren't sure if he is just a bureaucrat, stupid or a normal Bunrodea. This race is still very strange to your understanding.`

			`After leaving your ship, an an elderly distinguished Bunrodea awaits you. He bows before you.`
			`"Greetings captain <last>, my name is Josuno and I am your new contact to the government. Our queen wishes to gratulate you to your great victory over the Korath fleet. She is very pleased by your work. You can find new opportunities to earn more honour on the job board."`
			`"And personally, I have to say it is an honour to meet you in person. Our deep space surveillance systems spread recordings of your fights with the Korath all over the empire. You are well known by most Bunrodea."`
			`"Well, I don't want to hold you back from your work. I wish you all the best, good luck and farewell." He starts walking away.`
			`"Wait a second" you say, "I have a question about my former contact man."`
			`Josuno slowly turns around. "There is nothing to say, but if you aren't in a hurry, maybe I can have a look at your ship?"`
			`As soon as you both enter the ship, he relaxes. "Your former contact is dead. The queen expects perfect appearance from her sons, and Shinao had many chances to prove himself. Unfortunately he didn't have enough brain or skills to survive the high expectations of his position. Is there anything else you want to know?"`
			`Still shocked about the cruel fate of the poor young Bunrodea, you say goodby to Josuno and head over to the job board.`

			`After landing you see a large crowd of Bunrodea gathering in front of your ship. From dock workers, security personnel to lower dignitaries, everyone seems to be there.`
			`As the ramp of your ship lowers and you step outside, the crowd falls silent and raises their arms in unison. You wonder what that means. Josuno pushes himself out of the crowd, stands silently in front of you and raises his arms.`
			`Since he doesn't make any effort to say anything, you decide to ask what it all means.
			`"I'm sorry Captain <last>, I completely forgot how little you know about our customs. That arm gesture is a sign of deep respect. Everyone here saw your space battle with the worldship live on the space surveillance system. And everyone is here to honor you."`
			`"It is our custom that you now raise your arms to acknowledge the honor."`
			`As you raise your arms, all the Bunrodea lower theirs and the crowd slowly disperses.`
			`"Such displays of honor are usually only seen in the Queen's palace, and practically never to a non-noble."`
			`"Well, our Queen has instructed me to express our deepest gratitude to you and to assure you the eternal friendship of the Bunrodea Empire. And I personally would like to thank you as well. Just knowing you has brought me great honor."`

			`Since Josuno seems very tense, you decide to fly off straight away. It makes you a little nervous that the queen summons you and has a heavily armed ship accompany you. It either ends very badly or very well.`

			`When you arrive on Erabuthro, an equally heavily armed escort of 12 Bunrodea awaits you, led by the very serious-looking Josuno.`
			`You make your way to the palace. The queen's huge palace seems even more intimidating due to the circumstances of your journey. When you reach the throne room, the herald announces you as "Captain <first> <last>, Terror of the Korath, Defender of the Border Systems", which calms you down a bit. These people are really difficult to interpret. The queen looks at you and rises from her throne.`
			`"Captain <last>, you have more than proven your friendship with the Bunrodean Empire. And we now prove our friendship with you. You will receive the title 'Special Representative', full access to all our planets and our equipment. We will also give you one of our strongest warships as a gift, a 'Chigiriki'."`
			`The queen raises her arms in the air. In perfect synchronicity, your escort, Josuno and two dozen nobles raise their arms to show you their respect. This all impresses you very much and you almost forget to raise your arms to accept the honor. This ends the audience and you are escorted out.`
			`When you arrive at the spaceport, you are still in your thoughts. What an experience. Despite the differences, you like the Bunrodea, and they probably like you too.`

			`As you cross the spaceport you notice something strange. Four security guards escort a handcuffed and battered prisoner to a small ship. In front of the ship they take off his shackles and beat him. Then they hand him a key card and take him to the ship's airlock. The small spaceship takes off and rises into the atmosphere. The four security guards leisurely stroll away.`
			`A passerby notices your confusion and speaks to you.`
			`"Is this the first time you've observed an execution ritual?"`
			`After you say yes, the passerby continues.`
			`"We equip criminals with a small spaceship and drive them off the planet. After an hour, an execution request is announced and anyone interested can take part in the hunt for the criminal. This is very lucrative but also a bit dangerous. But for such an experienced captain as you are, it shouldn't be a problem. Such requests can be found on the job boards." The passerby says goodbye and moves on.`
