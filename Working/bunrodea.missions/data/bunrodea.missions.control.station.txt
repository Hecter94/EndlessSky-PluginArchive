			`This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.`
			``
			`Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.`
			``
			`Some missions from landing/spaceport unlock jobs. Others just give reputation or unlock story progression. Each job gives 5 to 40 reputation.`
			`Averagely you have to do like 50 jobs, less if you take the fighting jobs. Like in vanilla play, hit spaceport often.`
			``			
			`Since it's often questioned, here is a guide to the bunrodea first contact mission: Travel through Bunrodea territory till you've killed at least one Bunrodea ship, then fly to a human system (Misam works), land there and you get a mission, that brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.`
