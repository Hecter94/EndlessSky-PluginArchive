			`When you depart your ship, you're startled by a small alien ship uncloaking right in front of you. Two elegant mantis-like creatures step off it, each holding a strange looking weapon pointed directly at you. They have four long insectoid legs and two arms. Although their arms end in what look like hands, they also have strange claw-like features that partially enclose them, extending outward from their forearms to grasp their weapons. You look around to see if there's anyone else witnessing this, but you've landed at <origin>'s main spaceport in the middle of the night, leaving you as the only human in sight.`
			`	The aliens begin speaking to you in a language you don't understand, their words interspersed with clicking noises. As one of them speaks, they sound almost robotic, as if they are speaking through a synthesizer. Taking a closer look, you spot what you can only guess are cybernetic modifications to parts of the alien's body; the alien's throat and one of its eyes look non-organic, as well as the joints of its legs. The other one has no such visible modifications, though.`

				`	"I don't understand a word you're saying."`

				`	(Dodge for cover.)`
					goto dodge
			`	You pick up the device and look at it. It springs open in your hand, causing you to drop it. After it falls to the ground, it begins projecting a holographic star map. You recognize some of the systems on the map as those where you fought an alien fleet, made up of ships similar to the one in front of you. A single system within that region is highlighted. The aliens return to their ship, which becomes invisible again, and although you can't see it, you hear it take off and fly away.`

			`As you enter the atmosphere, you're flanked by two large alien ships which guide you to the surface, leading you to a particular landing zone. When you leave your ship, you're met by two aliens that look similar to the ones that startled you on <origin>, including having the same weaponry.`
			`	As you take a moment to look around, you find yourself in the middle of a massive metropolis. Skyscrapers taller than anything you've ever seen in human space cover the horizon, although most of the buildings around you appear far more elegant in architecture. Directly ahead is a large palace-like building with a considerable number of steps leading up to the front doors.`
			`	You take a step forward, but one of the aliens says something while waving its weapon around, and you take the hint that you shouldn't be moving right now. The other says something into a communication device, then sits down on the ground and gestures for you to do the same. You suspect that you might be waiting here for a while.`
			choice

					goto sit
				`	(Turn around and re-enter my ship.)`
			`	You reenter your ship, and the aliens don't move to stop you. You decide to turn your ship back on and attempt to take off, but just as you try to activate the repulsor engines, you hear a loud buzzing sound coming from outside. You look out the nearest window, and see that the aliens have moved some sort of vehicle near your ship, buzzing with energy. You attempt to take off, but your ship's repulsor engines aren't moving you anywhere. The vehicle seems like it is deactivating any nearby repulsors.`

It looks like the aliens didn't take too kindly to your action, though, as you begin seeing ships targeting you on your radar.`

			`	After some time, you look up to the palace steps and notice a six-limbed creature unlike the mantis-like aliens watching over you. As it slowly makes its way downward and gets to the last few steps, the aliens guarding you stand to attention. You wonder if this entire time you've just been waiting for this alien to reach the bottom of the stairs.`
			`	The creature approaches you on all six limbs, but stands up on its hind two legs once it is only a few paces away from you. It is rather small, hardly reaching your chin while it stands at full height, with big round eyes and a large, bulbous nose. It extends its four arms outward, revealing the palms of its hands. Except for its face and palms, it is covered in a thin layer of golden brown fur. It begins speaking. You can't understand what it's saying, but it seems to be cycling through various different languages and pausing after each line, as each sentence sounds wildly different from the last. You're suddenly startled when it says perfectly, "Hello."`

			choice
				`	"I'm not the first human here?"`
				`	"What do you mean one hundred years ago?"`
			`	"Human visitors, many years ago," it says. "Not important. The Queen desires yours presence." It then says something in a language that the mantis-like aliens understand, and they motion for you to follow as the small alien begins making its way back to the steps of the palace. You have a feeling you're going to dread the next half hour.`
			`	You finally reach the top of the palace stairs completely exhausted, although the aliens with you look entirely unphased.`
			`	The aliens lead you into the palace and through various elegant hallways. The walls are lined with marble statues and paintings that seem to be depicting historical figures and events for this alien race, although you're not allowed to linger long enough to get a good look at any of them.`
			`	You eventually approach a large ornate doorway that the aliens push open, revealing what must be the Queen's throne room. It is a long, narrow room lined with stained glass windows with what you guess is a throne chair where the alien Queen sits. The Queen is part of the mantis-like species and considerably larger in appearance than the ones guarding you.`
			`	The small creature says something to the Queen as you approach, and the Queen responds. The creature turns to you to translate.`

The playing field is huge and round. There is a barrel on two opposite sides, surrounded by a trench filled with water. As the teams enter the field, some players from both teams begin to beat each other. The crowd screams with excitement. A young Bunrodean sitting next to you notices your confusion.`

			`"The battles between the rival teams are part of the game and allowed. The actual game revolves around the 'Flonk', a flightless pterodactyl, that is used as a ball. The flonk must be brought into a basket in the opponent's end zone, which results in a 'Flopp' (for a distance throw) or a 'double Flopp' (by jumping to the basket). The game ends when the seventh Flonk is placed in the basket. If both teams have the same number of Flopps, an eighth Flonk is played. Another method to end the game successfully is to decimate the opposing team through hard play to such an extent that they no longer have enough players available. The game is led by a referee. He punishes fouls with giving the Flonk to the opposing team. Since fighting is permitted, it is only considered a foul if hidden weapons are drawn and used. "`
			`You thank the young Bunrodea for that enlightening explanation. Now that you know the rules, you enjoy the game to the fullest. A lot of blood flows over the next hour. Players are carried off the field with serious injuries. And then the blue team wins because all of the red team's players leave the field, most of them carried by medics. On your way out of the stadium, you're still thinking about the game. That was a really strange experience.`

"Isn't snap fly hunting thrilling?" Takeno asks. You don't really understand the Bunrodea's hunting behavior. Sure, it was a nice trip, but the Bunrodeans seem totally ecstatic. Maybe it's due to the biochemistry of snapping flies, since all of your companions have tasted their blood with targeted bites. Back at the spaceport, you thank them for the experience and say goodbye. Maybe some day you'll find out more about that.`
