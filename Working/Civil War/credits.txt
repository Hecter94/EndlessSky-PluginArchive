One Thousand and Fourty Three 
years after humanity took their 
first steps into the stars, a young 
pilot is about to do the same. 

Their journey is entirely yours to 
command. Make your fortune 
trading goods, mining asteroids, 
smuggling dangerous people and 
cargo, or raiding and stealing 
ships both innocent and hostile.

Chose a side in the upcoming war. 
Explore the depths of the universe
and seek out new factions to 
befriend... or conquer.

Will you choose to side with the 
Republic Navy that unites the stars, 
or those who choose to rebel 
against them? Does your loyalty lie
with your bank account...
and nothing else?


		     The choice is yours...
