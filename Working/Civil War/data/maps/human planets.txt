	description `Ada is the home planet of Lovelace Labs, highly respected designers of starship systems and weaponry. Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs as well as other industrial companies that make a home here.`
	description `	From above, the planet appears lifeless and barren. Cities on Ada are built into the walls of canyons, where they are protected from the winds and dust storms that sweep and scar the surface.`
	spaceport `The canyon the spaceport is built in was blasted out to create trenches hundreds of meters wide and deep, a network of flight lanes marked well with with lights and beacons. Behind the docking caves is a bustling subterranean city where bare rock and gleaming metal have been woven together into architexture both functional and elegant. The lighting varies over the course of the day to match the sunlight outside.`

The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that given a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed they could take easy advantage of such a society.`
	description `	The anarchist farming communes, each self sufficient but always open to outside trade, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a readier surplus of supplies, are located in the craggy, defensible mountain ranges, with the flat valleys set aside as landing strips.`
	spaceport `It's wise to put on a warm coat before leaving the ship, as the icy wind penetrates to the bone of even the heartiest visitors to this small spaceport town. You pass by ranchers herding cattle, a few farmers driving old, rusted-out trucks full of produce, and a couple of shady figures huddled in an alleyway negotiating what looks like a drug deal. In the center of town is a merchant's exchange and a greasy spoon diner.`
	spaceport `	The sign over the spaceport bar reads, "No Gods, No Masters." Below it in smaller, differing writing is another sign which reads, "No Cybernetic Implants, Badgers, Weasels, Or Polecats."`

	spaceport `The station's cavernous visitor center is the quietest spaceport you have ever been in. Despite the multitudes of people bustling with carts of books or stacks of data pads, the only noise above a whisper you hear comes from the startled outburst of an elderly scholar, who immersed in their reading as they wandered, collided with someone.`
	spaceport `	From here, passageways lead off into the wings of the library in a labyrinth of hallways, stairs, and library stacks. Some reinforced doors require key cards to enter, and others have no opening controls of any sort that you can see.`

While it is possible that terraforming would moderate Dancer's atmospheric activity enough to make it a less dangerous place to live, the cost is obscenely prohibitive.`

The locals respond by keeping a big enough supply on hand to satisfy them; any sort of planetary defenses would cost far more than the price of the amount of food that an average fleet of warships can carry. Once you make it clear you are here to trade and not to steal, you are greeted quite enthusiastically.`

The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is remarkably dim.`
	description `	The fishing settlements are the second colonization attempt on this planet, originally known as Deep. In the early days of hyperdrive, the Kingsburg Corporation sent out one of their of the largest and most technologically advanced colonization fleets deep into the then-unexplored Southern Galactic Rim. After two centuries of sporadic contact, the colony fell silent. When human expansion finally reached this area again, little trace of the original colony was found. The planet was then rechristened New Roanoke.`

Most of the large-scale fishing here is done by a single company, Poseidon Industries, who built and maintain the spaceport. Steep winding roads and sturdy cement homes and warehouses line the mountain slopes, and below you in the harbor massive trawling vessels are moored. On the outskirts of the spaceport are the ramshackle houses and open-air marketplace used by the smaller, independent fishing families.`

It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, requiring them to call for help from another village. An urban legend has sprang up that a great sandworm patrols the desert, calling up storms and earthquakes to scare colonizers from taking over any more of the world. Such claims have never been substantiated.`

Aside from running the fueling station, one of the few jobs for the workers here is to operate the bulldozers that push away the snowdrifts and keep the station from being buried beneath them. Although the air is breathable, ships that land here connect directly to docking tubes, to protect their crews from the icy air.`

Today, Vinci is the foremost manufacturer of CPUs in all of human space, and their processors are found in everything from navigational computers to video phones to intelligent toasters. Because this world is home to so many cleanroom fabrication plants, pollution is very tightly controlled.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is so full of high-fidelity holographic displays that you have trouble at times telling where the virtual reality ends and the physical reality begins; what looks like a paper poster on the wall will suddenly change to a different picture every minute, and the department store mannequins follow you with their eyes. You feel like you are trapped in someone's drug-assisted vision of the future.`

	landscape land/hills4
	description `Watcher is a small moon, the only world in this system that sustains any indigenous life. Because of the low gravity, humans have not yet built a permanent settlement here, but it is occasionally visited by biologists interested in studying low-gravity life forms. There are forests here where the trees grow over two hundred meters tall.`

planet Wayfarer
	attributes "requires: landing gear" south factory
	landscape land/nasa1
	description `Wayfarer was initially settled by a team of scientists seeking to study the nearby wormholes, and later diplomats seeking to build a relationship with the aliens from beyond them. Partly through the aid of the aliens and partly through a desire to emulate them, it has grown into a very technologically advanced world.`
	description `	Tarazed corporation, a maker of alien-inspired ships and outfits, is one of the largest industries on Wayfarer, and they draw raw materials from throughout this region of space.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is clearly the artifact of an architect who was as familiar with alien architecture as with human. Instead of square angles it has many curved walls and domes. The landing pads jut out from the building at various heights. Some of the landing pads are designed with docking tubes specifically for Quarg visitors, and the ceilings are unusually high to accommodate the Quarg and flying Wanderers, several of whom are walking around and mingling with the humans here.`

	landscape land/bwerner0
	description `Nearly three quarters of the surface of Windblain is ocean. Most of the industry here centers around petrochemicals: deep sea oil drilling, refining, and manufacture of plastic composites and synthetic fabrics for clothing. There are a few large cities on the continents, but also plenty of wilderness spaces as yet untouched by human activity.`
	description `	The local climate and economy are neither good enough to attract immigration, nor bad enough to drive people to leave. There seems to be almost no interest in the affairs of the wider galaxy.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in one of the main cities, and is built partly on land and partly on piers that stretch out into the harbor, so that cargo can be brought to the port by truck or by barge. There are even a few runways for aircraft, in addition to the landing pads for starships. In the wharf area, fresh cooked fish and sushi are sold from a small cluster of wooden huts. Farther inland, cargo crates are stacked under the immense tents that serve as warehouses. There is a constant flow of people and cargo in between the harbor and the city.`

planet Winter
	attributes "requires: landing gear" south factory frontier
	landscape land/snow3
	description `The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
	description `	The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built on a large rock outcropping, with brilliant blue glaciers flowing to either side down into a lake below. The sight is stunning, and all the more appealing because you are able to view it from behind plate glass windows, in the warmth of the spaceport, rather than in the frigid air outside. Above you, several layers of clouds are scudding across the sky in different directions.`
	spaceport `	Faded posters on the walls advise you to buy an estate on Winter now before prices skyrocket. The posters depict children playing in a lush green landscape while their grandparents stand by, looking quietly pleased with the wisdom of their investment.`

	description `Wyvern Station was once one of the end destinations for the merchant caravans traveling along the Rim, back in the days before the Republic existed when most systems were not policed and the only way to avoid being plundered by pirates was for ships to travel in large convoys. It has also been a continuously operating hyperspace fuel refinery for more than three centuries.`
	spaceport `This station is old, and some parts are dirty and in need of repair, but it is at least structurally sound, and the workers here seem optimistic and energetic. The cafeteria is loud and raucous, and the repair shop is more than willing to work on starships as a break from the tedium of repairing the harvester drones that dip into the planet's atmosphere to bring back pressurized tanks full of hydrogen gas.`

	description `Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`
	description `	Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.`
	spaceport `To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships like yours and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet. The port is nearly deserted, however; it is clear that they do not do much business here.`

	description `Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture.`
	description `	The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards, which focuses on designing well-defended merchant ships to survive the pirates that are so common here.`
	spaceport `The spaceport of Zug has been growing by amalgamation for centuries. At its core is the "Old Port," a set of quaint and rudimentary shops and warehouses. The landing pads for the Old Port were torn up to make room for what the locals call "The Port," a set of buildings that were constructed a century ago, with bolder architecture and more modern design. Some distance away is the "New Port," a towering structure with robotic cargo lifts and large hangars for more expensive ships. Meanwhile, plans are apparently underway for an expansion of the New Port. You can't help but wonder what the new expansion will be named.`
