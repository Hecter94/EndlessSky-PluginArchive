			`	The Alpha casually lifts Peg out of his seat, throws him across the cafe, and sits in the warlord's now vacant seat. "Oh, where do I begin? Let's start with our genesis."`
			`	"I'm sure you know already that we were created as super soldiers to be used by various factions. The reason for that, however, is because those in charge were getting reports of normal soldiers refusing orders. Things such as leveling towns full of innocent bystanders, shooting down unarmed passenger ships, and contaminating spaceports with radiation or bioweapons. The human soldiers were apparently brought up with the idea that 'life was sacred' or something." His tone turns to what you can only assume is mockery: "That 'only bad people' should be killed, and when faced with the flimsy excuses for why they were slaughtering these innocents, they tended to refuse to explain like the cowards they are."`
			`	The being calls over a waiter, and whispers his order before continuing. There is an interesting smell in the air, which both turns your stomach and compels you to be silent.`
			`	"So, where was I? Ah yes, our origins. It was decided that there was a need for soldiers who were 'emotionless,' and, well, cheaper to maintain for increased combat efficiency. Starting with your 'basic' human, it was decided to focus on developing a streamlined combat being, one who would obey orders without question, and could be fielded without much overhead. Turns out your human frame is the only useful thing about you in combat. However, the limits of genetic engineering at the time seemed to be infinite. They started taking samples from various sources; cockroaches, bacteria strains, grasshoppers and the like. They set out to create the perfect beings, us. A perfect blend of strengh, agility, tactical prowess, radiation and bioweapon resistances, and natural built-in regenerating armor in the form of our exoskeleton. Capable of surviving and fighting for hours in empty space, underwater, in mostly any environment, really. And only occasionally with extra gear."`
