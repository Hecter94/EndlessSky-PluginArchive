			`An admiral you somewhat recognize from the news some time ago called a meeting of the Humanitarian Corps stationed on New Wales. You show up with the others, a few dozen in total, and the admiral silences the crowd by holding up her hand before speaking into the microphone, "Alright, this won't take long. My name is Stella, and I have some good and bad news for you all."`
			`	"Just to get this out of the way, no, we're not losing the war or anything. In fact, things are looking up for us. The Free Worlds just demoted and denounced a member of their council and their strategist, Tomek Voigt. We're hoping to bring the Free Worlds back into line very soon."`
			`	"Now for the bad news.  You're all being cut loose for at least a few months. The Free Worlds have pirates working for them, and it's just too dangerous to have pacifists working around them." This draws complaints from the crowd, but Stella keeps talking. "Don't worry, we'll still sign your paychecks if you can find work somewhere else in the Republic. I'd try the Deep or the Syndicate. Any questions?"`

				`	"Uh, yeah. Why have my superiors been making me break the Humanitarian part of my contract?"`
				`	"Wait, why did the Free Worlds kick out one of their leaders? Did he break a law?"`
				`	"What does that dude being demoted have to do with winning the war anyway?"`
				`	(Remain silent.)`
			`	A number of hands shoot up in the crowd, but Stella ignores them. "Ooh, sorry, I just ran out of time for questions. Well, see you all around." Stella walks off the stage and leaves the Humanitarian Corps behind to answer their own questions.`
