		log "Factions" "Alphas" `The Alphas were designed hundreds of years ago as genetically engineered super-soldiers, with no compassion or empathy. They escaped from their masters, enslaved entire planets, and commanded massive fleets of ships. Eventually they were defeated, and were either killed or went into hiding. They can be recognized by their green, photosynthetic skin.`
			`Alphas can live for centuries, and it is likely that many of them have survived, hiding out on anarchist worlds or somewhere beyond human space. Fortunately, they reproduce much more slowly than ordinary humans do.`
		conversation
			`Today, throughout human space, is Remembrance Day, the anniversary of the beginning of the Alpha Wars more than five centuries ago. The Alphas were genetically engineered soldiers, with superhuman agility and intelligence, and a complete lack of compassion or empathy. At the height of the War, dozens of planets had been enslaved by the Alphas.`
			`	Remembrance Day commemorates the beginning of the war, rather than its end, as a perpetual reminder that the war is not over: although the Alphas were defeated, some of them escaped and remained in hiding, and they and their offspring are presumed to still be present in the galaxy today.`
			`	Since the Alpha War, genetic resequencing technology has been very tightly controlled. Because the Alphas were the product of experimental genetic manipulation rather than natural evolution, it is believed that their genes are less robust than true human beings, and they are almost unable to have viable offspring without access to special technology. Therefore, most Alpha enclaves that have been discovered since the War have had very small populations, no more than a few dozen.`
			`	In these days when the Navy ensures peace throughout much of the galaxy, on many worlds the Alphas are treated as nothing more than a bogeyman story to frighten children. Because the most striking physical feature of the Alphas was their photosynthetic skin, on some worlds kids even run around wearing green face paint on Remembrance Day, trying to frighten people. But on other worlds, especially on the fringes of space where the Navy seldom patrols, the Alphas are still spoken of with fear.`

			`	The reporter's voice is cool and professional, but there's no mistaking the genuine emotion behind it.`
			`	"Early July 4th, the Galactic Stock Exchange and the Navy Shipyard orbiting Geminus and Martini were targeted by what is believed to be a terrorist organization calling themselves “The Free Worlds”, previously known as the Southern Mutual Defence Pact. This follows the Parliament super majority vote on July 3rd that refused their demands of a reform on trade tarrifs, ship licensing, and parliamentary representation."`
			`	"Eyewitness accounts, while currently unsubstantiated, have placed Southern Mutual Defense Pact ships in the systems where the attacks occurred. Former Representative Katya Reynolds, releasing a statement earlier today, claims that this is a fabricated excuse to justify a Republic crackdown in the south and prevent their secession."`
			`	"As cleanup following this vicious attack continues, our own Republic Navy has confirmed information that these attacks were carried out using nuclear weapons, which have long since been outlawed due to their cruelty and environmental fallout. Current estimates have put the death rate at over ten thousand civilians and Navy personnel. Our hearts and prayers go out to the families affected by these attacks."`
			`	"On the subject, Navy Commander Joan Chavarria gave a clear message, promising all of us shocked and hurt by these attacks that justice will be served. I am also now being informed that the Navy has put out a call for assistance from all available captains, promising military grade pay for taking over non-essential logistics support tasks as the Navy diverts defense fleets to protect the galaxy from any further attacks."`

However, it is likely that all manner of illegal activity is still going on in secret here.`

		description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. After that, it was taken over by pirates, and became a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. Now, at least in theory it is an independent station, no longer allied with the pirates. In practice, you suspect a fair amount of piracy still goes on here.`

The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry. For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
