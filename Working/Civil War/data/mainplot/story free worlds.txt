While you are waiting for the food to arrive, Mr. Eyes raises his glass of wine and says, "A toast, to Captain <last> and our marvelous new toy. May it bring us good information and swift justice."`

My home town is under thirty meters of glacier by now."`

We had six months or so to move two million settlers off-world before the temperatures would drop too low to be livable. More than half of the Navy was mobilized to ferry our people to other planets."`
			`	"Here's the best part," says Eyes. "The Navy operates with a certain amount of autonomy. Turns out when they found out about the disaster, they mobilized without even waiting to clear it with Parliament. Which was technically within their mandate, this being a natural disaster. But the Navy is funded by taxes, and the Paradise Planets pay ten times as much in taxes as the Dirt Belt."`
			`	"The Paradise Planets viewed the Navy as their own private security force," says Katya, "so they got really mad when half the Navy suddenly vanished to assist some dirty refugees. Because those admirals gave the order to assist us, millions of lives were saved. And then Parliament fired them."`

			`	"I was a child on Vinci while this was happening," says Eyes. "A paradise world. I would listen to the news and could never understand why all the adults around me were so very, very angry that the Navy had gone off to rescue two million people from freezing to death. But they told me that we lived in one little island of safety in a dangerous galaxy, and that without the Navy protecting us the pirates or even maybe aliens would sweep in and destroy our homes and take our money. That it was us against the whole galaxy."`

Of course, the materials we receive from Free space are equally valuable. But if we remain nominally a part of the Republic, they will have full access to this system, including searching incoming and outgoing freighters."`

They continue talking for a while, and you leave well convinced that Tarazed is willing to support you and that the best way they can do that for now is by remaining neutral.`

And nearly all of us disappeared, that day. Most never returned from the 'checkups.' Only a few of us were left behind. "`

Anyway, somehow news of that event got off-world and not long after, the Navy came in massive numbers, destroyed the Alpha fleets and liberated our planet. In the process, they tried to invade an underground facility up in the mountains, which is where they thought the rest of us were being kept.

As Nguyen shakes your hand, you are struck by the fact that although he is your enemy, you see no trace of hostility in his eyes - in fact, his expression is surprisingly warm and affectionate.`

			`	You are just about to leave when Freya spots something and points. "Look," she says, "someone is coming down the mountain slope toward us." Sure enough, it's a group of several dozen people wearing the distinctive robes of the monks.`
			label narcissus
			`	As you wait for them to approach, JJ receives a message from one of the militia crews. "Sir, you have incoming! A lone gunship with Republic markings. Shall we intercept them?"`
			`	"Oathkeepers?" asks JJ. "Or ordinary Navy? Who are they?"`
			`	The voice on the other end pauses. "Neither. Navy Intelligence."`
			`	JJ thinks about that for a second, then says, "Let them land. But follow them down, and if you see so much as a hint of them powering up weapons, blow them out of the sky. Understand?" The officer acknowledges his order and signs off.`
			`	As the group of monks approaches from the mountainside, the scout ship comes in for a landing and skids to a halt in the dirt a few dozen meters away. A woman steps off it. She has dark skin, and is dressed entirely in black. Even the whites of her eyes are black: when she gets closer, you can see that it is actually a scleric tattoo, an intricate Celtic knotwork pattern inked into the whites of her eyes. She sees you staring at her, and winks at you with a friendly grin.`
			choice
				`	"I'm Councilor <last> of the Free Worlds. What is your business here?"`
				`	"Who are you, and what gives you the right to land on our planet?"`
					goto hostile
			`	"My name is Raven," she says. "I'm here to question this defector. If he is telling the truth, our war with you will end today." She pauses, then adds, grimly, "And, another war will begin."`
				goto questioning
			label hostile
			`	She frowns. "My name is Raven," she says. "I am here to question this defector. If you are interested in knowing the truth, you will allow me to do so."`
			label questioning
			`	The monks approach, and you see that among them is a man in more ordinary attire, who must be the defector. "Now," says Raven, "I will question him alone, on my ship."`
			choice
				`	"No, we insist on being present for your interrogation."`
					goto present
				`	"Very well, we'll wait outside."`
			`	"No!" says JJ. "We're staying here."`
			label present
			`	She hesitates for a long moment. This is probably going against whatever orders she is following. But finally she says, "Very well." The monks step aside. She approaches the defector, and reaches out her hands to him. Hesitantly, he takes her hands. It's an oddly intimate scene, the two of them quietly holding hands and locking eyes - not like any interrogation you have seen before. "Now," she says, "tell me your story."`
			`	"My name is Sawyer," says the man. "I'm a physicist, a Syndicate employee. We had a secret project on Mutiny, a planet in a pirate system. We were developing nuclear weapons." He hesitates, and looks away for a second, then says, "They told me it was for fighting the pirates. I didn't realize otherwise until--"`
			`	"That is a lie," says Raven, calmly.`
			`	He seems flustered. "Okay, they didn't tell me what the weapons were for, and I didn't ask."`
			`	"Another lie," Raven repeats, "not a good sign if you want us to help you."`
			`	"Fine!" He declares loudly, "I knew exactly what they were for, and I built them anyway for the thrill of the job, and the money."`
			`	"Better." Raven states calmly.`
			choice
				`	"Why would the Syndicate attack the Republic?"`
				`	"Why did you wait so long to report this?"`
					goto wait
			`	They both seem surprised at you asking a question. Sawyer says, "War is good for business, especially if you're in the business of making weapons. The Syndicate's profits have more than doubled since this conflict began."`
			`	"What led you to report this?" asks Raven.`
			label wait
			`	He says, "It was when I heard that there had been another major battle. Up until then I had been telling myself that the worst of the damage was done. But after that battle, I knew that millions more could die because of our crime, and that I had the power to stop it."`
			`	"Please stop lying," Raven says calmly. "If you had a conscience about this, you would have come clean after the initial bombings."`
			`	Sawyer is clearly infuriated, his face becomes flushed. "My co-workers started going missing, and I fear I was next on the list. Can we stop arguing semantics?"`
			`	As the monks tend to their dead and wounded, Raven continues to ask questions of Sawyer: who was involved, how the facility was hidden, where the raw materials came from. At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were a bit more medieval."`
			`	Finally, Raven is satisfied, and radios her ship. "He's telling the truth," she tells them. "Send word to the admirals at once. And, release the captive."`
			`	The door of her ship slides open, and another woman steps out. It takes you a few seconds to realize that it's Katya.`
			`	As you all rush over to greet Katya, Raven taps your shoulder and says quietly, "We are being disrespectful to the survivors of this monestary. Meet me in the and we'll figure out what's going to happen next." She returns to her ship and takes off, heading for the spaceport.`

			`When you land on Valhalla, a man shows up at your ship and introduces himself as Edrick Flint, the governor of Valhalla. He invites all of you to join him for dinner at his home, which turns out to be an apartment on the twenty-third floor of one of the downtown skyscrapers. There, he introduces you to several other regional governors and authorities.`
			`	"You may be aware," Edrick says, "that the Deep was self-governing before the formation of the Republic. Indeed, during some of the darkest centuries of the space age, the Deep stood out as a beacon of civilization, a place where piracy was not tolerated and all travelers were safe. When we joined the Republic, we retained the authority to police our own territory, and that authority includes the right to track down fugitives who have fled beyond our usual jurisdiction."`

				`	"Wait, before we talk details, are you saying that you believe Sawyer's testimony against the Syndicate?"`

			label police
			`	"We want to see justice done," says Edrick. "Our proposal is that a fleet under our jurisdiction, but joined by Free Worlds and Oathkeeper vessels, will travel into the Core and arrest at least one of the Syndicate masterminds behind the terrorist attacks. Such an action would satisfy the technical requirements of legality provided that immediately prior to the arrest, one of our courts hears Sawyer's testimony and pronounces that Syndicate individual guilty."`
			choice
				`	"The phrase 'Technically legal' and I have seldom got along."`
				`	"How exactly do we avoid a major battle?"`
					goto travel
			
			`	Ijs laughs at that. "Relax, Captain. I've been doing 'technically legal' stuff for years. It only occasionally goes disastrously wrong. But governor, if the Syndicate sees you coming, you'll need a full-scale war fleet, not just a handful of ships."`
			label travel
			`	"That's why the fleet will be composed of ships from three different organizations," says Edrick. "You will find a reason to travel to Earth with perhaps one of your fancy new Elpis as an escort. When you arrive, there will just happen to be an Oathkeeper patrol passing through the same system. And a merchant convoy from the Deep. With its own set of escorts, of course."`
			`	"We'd need to know exactly where and on what planet our target lives, prior to entering Syndicate space," says Katya. "And, if you want to have a court trial immediately prior to the arrest, it sounds like Sawyer will need to stay here."`
			`	"Indeed," says Edrick, "but I assure you, he is safer from the Syndicate here than anywhere else in human space, your own territory included. As for locating a target, that's why the Oathkeepers have requested that you visit them on Farpoint."`
			`	The rest of the evening is a more casual time for conversation, with plenty of good food and drink.`
			`	At one point, Edrick pulls you aside and says, "I've requested that you be granted access to some of the new technology that was developed here during the course of the war. In particular, please find space on your ship for a ramscoop; you will need it for your next mission. And also, here." He hands you a data card. "This is a copy of Sawyer's evidence, in case something happens here. Keep it very, very safe."`

Few ships travel through there, because there is nowhere to refuel and it's pinned between us and the Northern Union, but with a ramscoop or enough fuel capacity, travel is possible.

Your hull is far too strong to be damaged by bullets, but the message is clear: you are not welcome here.`
			`	The spaceport is apparently deserted, and no one seems eager to come out and greet you. A few bullets continue to plink harmlessly off your hull, from snipers in the nearby buildings. "I think it would be best for me to just contact the governor via radio," says Alondo.`

No one would ever be able to feel safe in their own homes again."`

			`	"I hope so," says Alondo. "We'll let them keep shooting at us for a while, to vent their anger and let them prove their point.

I do not want to be the person who authorizes the first attack on civilian targets since the dawn of the Republic."`

			`	You wait for about an hour. Meanwhile, more Free Worlds ships continue to enter the system, one of which is carrying Tomek. He radios you and says, "I think we've got things under control here for now, which means there's no new mission for you yet. Just sit tight until the gunfire dies down."`

			`Sometime later, the gunfire dies down enough for militia forces to start securing small sectors of the spaceport without any actual fighting. It is time to meet up with Alondo.`
			`When you meet up with Alondo, he seems excited and optimistic. "The Republic has agreed to one week of safe passage," he says, "just enough time to get us to Earth and back. And what's more, I told them that one of our terms would be a mutual release of all prisoners of war, including Katya, and they agreed."`

			`	Alondo sighs. "Yes, but the Senate thought if we brought anything bigger, it might look like an attack fleet rather than an escort. And of course, it's not carrying nukes, because if the Navy picked those up on their sensors, they'd blast us out of the sky long before we could land on Earth. Anyway, let's get going and hope for the best."`

			`When you land on Earth, the Big Brother flies down to the spaceport with you to see that you arrive safely, then takes off immediately. You and Alondo are escorted to the House of Parliament. As you wait to be called in to speak to Parliament, Alondo seems very nervous, pacing back and forth and fiddling with his watch every few minutes.`
			`	Finally you are invited into the Parliament chambers, and Douglas Xao, the Speaker, says, "Representatives of the Free Worlds, we are prepared to hear your demands."`
			`	Alondo says, "We're not here to make demands. We're here to work together to negotiate a peace settlement. The Free Worlds are prepared to return all our prisoners of war, to cede control of the Cebalrai and Kaus Borealis systems back to the Republic, and to promise not to expand our territory north into the so-called 'breadbasket' worlds, even if those worlds want to join us. All we ask in return is autonomy, and peace, and a return of the prisoners you have taken, including Katya Reynolds."`
			`	Xao gestures to the guards, and they escort in a third person to stand beside the two of you. It takes you a moment to realize that it's Katya, looking rather worn-out and bedraggled. She whispers to you, "So, you're using nukes now? Whose damn fool idea was that?"`
			choice
				`	"It was the only way we could resist the Navy."`
				`	"I didn't find out that's what they were doing until afterwards. I don't like it any more than you do."`
			`	"Fair enough," she says, "but I hope it doesn't wreck our chances at negotiation."`
			`	Xao addresses the three of you. "We have heard your demands," he says, "and now, here is our response. Katerina Reynolds, Alondo Gruyere, and <first> <last>, you are hereby charged with treason and insurrection. Your trial will begin immediately."`
			choice
				`	"What? We were guaranteed safe passage!"`
				`	"Betrayal! We came here in good faith to negotiate peace."`
				`	<Remain Silent>`
			`	Alondo speaks up. He is not shouting, but his voice carries over the murmur of other voices. "We have a ship under the planetary shields. If we do not return--"`
			`	Xao cuts him off. "Your ship is no threat to us. We have already verified that it carries no nuclear weapons or n-bombs, and this building's shielding and anti-missile systems are quite sufficient to defend against conventional weapons. And there is nothing in its cargo hold but ordinary, non-radioactive metals."`
			`	Alondo says, "That's right. Tungsten, to be exact. Aerodynamic tungsten rods, each the size of a tree trunk, with a simple guidance system on one end. Our ship is in low earth orbit, traveling at a velocity of roughly eight kilometers per second." As he speaks, the Parliament chamber gradually grows very quiet. "So we will be returning to our ship," says Alondo, "with Miss Reynolds. If the ship in orbit does not hear from me every two minutes, it will jettison its cargo, and there will be nothing left of this building and it's surroundings but a rather large crater." He points to the watch he is wearing, and you realize that it must be some sort of communicator.`
			`	After a brief whispered consultation with a few of the other members of Parliament, Xao says, "You will lose this war, and you will pay dearly for it. Guards, let them return to their ship." You hurry back to your ship and take off immediately, aware that as soon as you are out of range of Earth, the Navy will probably be more than willing to attack you.`

			`Soon after you land, two men in militia uniforms approach your ship, and tell you they represent the "Wolf Pack." They introduce themselves as Rex and Fido; you're pretty sure those are not their real names.`
			`	Once you are in a private room inside your ship, Rex, who is the younger one, says, "With ramscoop technology, our ships will be able to venture deep into the Dirt Belt. Now, Captain, why do you think the Republic is so determined to hold on to the Dirt Belt, even if it means fighting bloody battles? It's clear that the tax revenue isn't worth it."`

			`	The man named Fido, who is older and has a thick beard, spreads out a map on the table. You recognize it as a chart of food prices throughout human space. "Food," says Rex. "The Republic is full of teeming, overpopulated worlds that could never hope to feed themselves. If we cut off the supply of food, the Republic will be forced to make peace with us."`

			`	"And with the pressure off the Free Worlds Militia forces, imagine the new technologies they could develop." Fido adds. "Kraz and Delta V could get the supplies they need for new weapons and power generators. Southbound could more easily source ship components for refits, and that secret project we keep hearing rumors of."`
