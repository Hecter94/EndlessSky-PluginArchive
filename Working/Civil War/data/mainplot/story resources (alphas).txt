	description `A strange combination of a supercomputer and a robotic factory. This outfit appears to allow Alpha ships to operate with relatively low manpower by handling all the basic maintenance tasks of a ship. It is so effective that it will even repair the hull and recharge the shields of the ship it's equipped in during combat.`

	description `Without these powerful cooling systems, the Alpha's destroyer would probably overheat within seconds of takeoff, and its effectiveness in combat would be non-existant.`

	description `This small Alpha projectile weapon is relatively similar to the Plasma Cannons developed by Kraz Cybernetics and used by the Free Worlds. Its weakness is that it generates a large amount of heat, enough that the gun must pause briefly after every few shots to cool down.`
