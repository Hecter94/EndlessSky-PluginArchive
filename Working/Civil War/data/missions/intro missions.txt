Really, jobs like this are just about target saturation, so its hard mess things up. Remember that we don't have to kill the pirates, all we have to do is make sure the convoy isn't destroyed. You can take a few hits for the freighter if you need to, but its good to realize that guns don't work in hyperspace, and we can repair our ships on just about any planet."`

			`	"Hello <first>," says James. "This is Marissa, a senior manager at the mines." She shakes your hand.`
			`	"Here's the deal,"  Marissa begins, without so much as saying hello. "Most of the gemstones we mine here are industrial grade, not pretty enough to be worth using as anything but sandpaper grit or drill bits. But every once in a while we happen on some higher quality gems. No one in this sector has the money to spend on jewelry, so we ship them north to the paradise worlds."`
			`	"And this is where the problem begins," James interrupts. Marissa shoots him a brief glare, then continues.`
			`	"Yes, in the past few months every shipment we've sent has been attacked by a pirate ship. The same ship. A bastion by the name of 'Hammer of Thor.' We can't justify the expense to pay a bounty hunter to take out the bastard, so instead we're going to pay you to outrun him. I assume the <ship> is faster than a Bastion?"`

The Bastion's shields are ten times as strong as yours, and if it's able to bring its weapons to bear, we'll be dead in two seconds. So, the moment we're in the sky, we head straight for hyperspace.

			`	"Don't make me regret telling you this," he says, "but smaller vessels like the Sparrow do have the ability to temporarily hide their emissions, although the heat build up is liable to disable the ship before you can do anything useful with it. Combine that with some short ranged torpedoes, and hypothetically, an experienced captain will have a fighting chance. Let's go."`

	`	As you are piloting your ship down to land on <planet>, James disappears into his bunk room. After the ship has landed he comes out, no longer in the grease-stained coveralls he's been wearing up until now, but in a suit. It's easy to tell that the suit is made of real wool, very finely woven, and that it has been tailored to fit him. He smooths down the front of the suit distractedly and then looks at his hands as if unsure of where to put them. "How do I look?" he asks.`

I'm rich enough to be here, but I just hope they're willing to socialize with someone who made his fortune flying a ship."`
