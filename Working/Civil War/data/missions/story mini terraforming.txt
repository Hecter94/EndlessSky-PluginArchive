		conversation
			`You drop off the two managers from Rand, whose names are Eric and Alaric, at the Academy. There is little else to do while you wait except look around the lobby. The students have apparently just had some sort of science symposium, and poster boards are on display all along the walls. One of them catches your eye: the title is "Affordable Terraforming through Equilibrium Mapping."`
			`	The basic concept of the poster seems to be that instead of altering the climate of a planet through brute force, it ought to instead be feasible to use a properly timed nudge in the right direction. "To cause the climate to shift toward a new equilibrium point that supports greater biological complexity." The poster says. This student seems to think that planets naturally "want" to grow more complex and support more life, but that they sometimes get "stuck" in less optimum states.`
			`	It's an intriguing idea. On the other hand, at the bottom of the paper, the professor has written, "Very poor scholarship. Do not anthropomorphize planets."`
			`	Just then, Eric and Alaric return, looking disappointed.`
			choice
				`	"No luck?"`
			`	They shake their heads. "It would cost fifteen million just to bring a specialist out for an initial consultation," says Eric, "and besides, the cost of terraforming machinery and upkeep is prohibitive. I think this whole Academy is just a money-making racket."`
			choice
				`	"Have a look at this poster. Maybe this student would help us. We could bill it as a sort of internship for her."`
				`	"Indeed. They gave this student a failing grade just for suggesting it could be done more cheaply."`
			`	They look at the poster. "Sounds almost too good to be true," says Alaric. "Hang on, I'll look her up in the campus directory." A few minutes later, he is on the phone with the student who made the poster. Her name is Amy. It turns out she is about to flunk out anyway, and is more than willing to travel back to Rand with you when offered a tiny fraction of what the consultant would have received.`
			`	An hour later, you meet up with Amy, and arrange for her to join you on your ship before it takes off. Eric and Alaric are very excited, but you are a bit worried about the wisdom of entrusting their planet's future to someone so young and inexperienced.`

As for how we will cause the volcano to erupt, we need something energetic enough to crack the planet's crust in the location of the volcano, releasing the pressure that the magma is causing to spark an eruption. That's where we bring in another asteroi-"`

We're three jumps from Sol, for Pete's sake, not to mention that the consequences of such an action could be disastrous should it go wrong! After all, in what way will this warm the planet when the resulting volcanic winter could last decades and only result in an even colder climate, like Hope! Hell are you even old enough to remember how a supereruption on Hope went? If the people of Tundra are this desperate to terraform their planet then normal techniques should be employed, none of this 'equilibrium mapping' nonsense."`
			`	"Sir," Amy speaks up with a stern tone of voice, "we have already been authorized by the Republic to undergo this terraforming experiment, so unless you have half a teraton of cheap explosives, we're going to need to use an asteroid. The volcanic winter can be easily avoided by having some freighters and aircraft sweep the volcanic ash out of the atmosphere, meaning we'll get the benefits of the greenhouse gases without the detriments of volcanic ash reflecting Cebalrai's heat back into space. Correct me if I'm wrong, but no one knew the volcano on Hope was going to erupt, so it couldn't have been planned for. We, however, can prepare for this eruption and take steps to mitigate the problems."`
			`	The representative falls silent. After a moment of thinking, he says "Captain, I need you to take me to Parliament. I may be able to authorize the use of explosives that should suffice, but it may not be as cheap as Ms. Amy is hoping. We're not about to turn asteroids into our single solution for everything."`

			`"Wait here," the Republic representative says curtly. Several hours later, he returns, not looking very happy. "What a waste of time. Parliament has declined my request. I don't much agree with this, but you will need to crash an asteroid into Tundra if you wish to achieve your goal. I'll send Amy and Nolan my concession message, they'll be ready for you when we get back."`

			`	You gather with the scientists in the spaceport bar. The Tundra native informs you that all residents close enough to the volcano to be in danger have been evacuated. "All we need to do now is find the right asteroid," Amy says, and after only a short time of searching, she finds the perfect candidate. "Just like last time, Captain."`

			`A plume of debris has formed in a mushroom cloud shape above where the asteroid hit. The scientists are viewing their instruments in anticipation for what happens next.`
			`	Almost an hour after the impact, the ground begins to shake slightly, even though the volcano is located hundreds of kilometers away. "This might be it!" Nolan exclaims as he closely watches a seismometer receiving readings from near the impact site. Suddenly the seismometer spikes, and another plume, much larger than the asteroid impact, rises from the impact site. Half an hour later, the low sound of the massive eruption can be heard in the spaceport, triggering another burst of cheers from the scientists. "It actually worked!" one of them yells out.`
			`	You fly the scientists over top of the volcano, allowing them to take readings of the air and surface. "Greenhouse gas levels are off the charts!" Amy exclaims. "Once these gases disperse across the planet's atmosphere, they should begin warming the entire planet."`
			`	The heat has formed a huge circle of melted snow around the volcano, revealingthe dull grays and browns of rock. Closer to the center of the eruption you spot dozens of lava flows emanating from the center of the impact crater.`

event "terraforming Tundra"
	planet "Tundra"
		description `Millions of years ago, this was a warm world, perhaps even tropical. But some cataclysmic event, perhaps a meteor strike or a massive volcanic eruption, altered the planet's atmosphere enough to turn it into the nearly lifeless, frozen planet it is today. Recent experiments in terraforming the planet have attempted to remedy the climate by causing a supervolcano to prematurely erupt.`
		description `	The first settlers came here to drill for the oil trapped deep under the surface, a relic of Tundra's former, more lively days. Instead of refining the oil into plastic, which sells relatively cheap in this region, they have developed an industry in synthetic fabrics and clothing.`

			`	"Tundra's climate has drastically improved. Areas around the equator are starting to become completely snow free, and I was amazed when I was able to walk outside without a heavy coat on. The Republic has placed a halt on any more experiments, as they wish to see how the situations on Tundra and Rand turn out.`

It's even becoming a popular tourist destination. They wanted me to relay their gratitude to you for making their dream come true.`

event "terraforming follow-up"
	planet "Rand"
		add attributes "tourism"
		description `Rand is a desert world, too dry for much farming and with gravity low enough to be uncomfortable for most human beings. It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south. Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves.`
		description `	Due to the results of recent terraforming experiments, Rand has become a moderately more habitable place. Fascination with this change in climate has led to Rand becoming a semi-popular tourist destination of the Dirt Belt.`
	planet "Tundra"
		spaceport `The spaceport village consists of several large domes, which keep out the wind and driving snow; ships enter and exit the largest of the domes through a hatch that closes as soon as they have come through. Before the planet was terraformed, enough snow would pile up on top of one of the domes every decade or so that it became a danger of collapsing under its own weight; the locals would simply move out of that dome and build another one higher up on the snowpack, but the changing climate has reduced the amount of snow enough that the locals may never need to build another dome again.`
