	`	The character you make is completely your own. Everything from their name, preferences, and identity is determined by your own imagination. However, in order to give you an interface with the universe, we do have some canonical backstories.`
	`	The first and easiest choice is the Trust Fund Baby. This character grew up on a wealthy planet and only moved to New Boston to get their pilot's license. They are currently waiting on their trust to pay up, but they won't have to wait long.`
	`	The second is the normal start for Endless Sky. The Textile worker who grew up on New Boston and has been dreaming of being a space pilot since childhood. They finally saved up enough for a down payment on a loan while studying for their pilot's license. Nothing special will happen to them unless they make it happen.`
	`	The final and most difficult is the Reformed Pirate. A former outlaw rehabilitated by the Republic and granted a merchant pilot's license, you barely qualify for a loan to purchase your new ship. However, you have made dangerous enemies in the past, and must be prepared to outrun them. You had better pick a fast ship!`

Finding ways to ignore enemy shields, overheat their vessels, or drain their batteries can prove even more effective than buying the biggest ship you can and slugging it out. Most secondary weapons, such as missiles, can help you out-range and outrun your enemy, too!`

	label crew
	`	Most ships will have room to hire additional crew, or will require more than one crew member to run the ship. Each crew member expects a daily salary, and they receive some of the fleet's profits. Salaries vary based on the rank of the crew member, as do their fleet shares. The more crew a given ship has, the more officers it requires, and the higher those officers need to be in rank. High ranking officers draw heavy salaries and have greater shares in the fleet's profits.
	`	A breakdown of the crew is as follows, in order of daily salary:`

	`	Your most common crew members, the "Regular Crew", handle these jobs. They also cost the least, each drawing a salary of 80 credits per day and only taking one share in the fleet's profits.`
	`	Some, usually cruel, captains have been known to throw hoards of their Regular Crew at hostile ships in boarding operations. Most people find this distasteful, and it is absolutely an abuse of your workforce. However, thanks to the Syndicate's economic influence, the Republic has yet to pass any laws restricting or prohibiting the practice.`

	`	The Universal Credit System is managed by an alien species known as the Quarg. According to them, these same credits are accepted by every "Tier One or higher" civilization in the known universe. Although there was a lot of political resistance in the early days of the Human exploration, the UCS "Bank" has been accepted and used by every human government for centuries.`
	`	This means that you could theoretically hire crew members on an alien planet, and they would automatically be paid the same as their human counterparts.`

	`	As the leader of the fleet, you get 100 shares. This means that you get the same amount of profit as 100 regular crew members. You also own all of the ships, outfits, and cargo. Even in a large fleet, no other individual crew member will ever have more fleet shares than you do.`
	`	Each kinds of crew member is given a different number of fleet shares, based on the risks and responsibilities they take on. While you are definitely in charge, your most senior crew members allow you to command an arbitrarily large fleet without becoming lost in a sea of petty concerns. In return, they receive a significant share of any profits that you make together.`

The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives.`
