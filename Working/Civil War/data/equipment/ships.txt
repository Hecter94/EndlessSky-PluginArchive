Over 85% of the parts that make up the Finch are shared with the Sparrow assembly line, so it's no surprise that even trimmed down to (barely) fit into a fighter bay, the blindingly fast Finch bears strong resemblance to its hyperspace-faring cousin."

	description `Though the Syndicate doesn't build fighter carriers, it is testing the waters with the Barb, a cheap and flexible carrier-launched craft featuring newly-developed miniaturized ion engines. The design philosophy of the Barb seems to have been "uglier than the Protector." Though an awkward-looking ship, it seems flexible enough to become a dangerous addition to any fleet with carriers.`

	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet, if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing", the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`

	description "Although Betelgeuse Shipyards produces other ship models as well, the majority of their profits come from sales of the Shuttle. This versatile ship serves well as an additional passenger transport or a cargo courier."
	description `	Shuttles are not designed to withstand combat of any sort, but they are fast and maneuverable enough to get out of harm's way if attacked by a larger, slower ship. Although they are typically unarmed, they have enough space for one weapon, which is the origin of the popular phrase, "as useless as a blaster cannon on a shuttlecraft."`

	description "The Lionheart Caravel was designed back in the days when the galaxy was more sparsely populated, and ships prospecting for habitable worlds or worlds rich in resources would often travel far away from any habitable ports where they would be able to refuel. Although the galaxy has now been much more thoroughly explored, the Scout remains a popular ship for long-distance travel."

	description "Several centuries ago, in the early days of the Republic, the sudden increase in commerce and space travel led to high demand for cargo ships. The founders of Southbound shipyards met this challenge head on. Haulers were first created simply by bolting a cockpit and engine block onto a cargo container, and the basic design has not changed much since then."

	description `Southbound Shipyards quickly answered the Free Worlds' call for a carrier by building modified cargo containers for Haulers - adding a pair of Fighter docking arms, some additional outfit space, and even a couple of bunks. Access to the fighters from within the ship is so inconvenient that most pilots opt to just stay aboard their fighters when in flight. While the technical name for this ship is "Hauler I: Type F", Southbound assembly workers started calling the single container variant the "Nest" due to its complement of Finch Fighters, and the name stuck.`

It is also, however, an incredibly slow ship and difficult to maneuver, especially when loaded down with cargo. Some freight caravans use ordinary freighters instead of bulk freighters just to avoid the hassle of constantly having to wait for the Bulk Freighter to properly align itself for hyperspace travel."

	description "The Headhunter is one of the newest ships designed by Lionheart: a versatile ship that can serve equally well for carrying cargo or for bounty hunting. As with many of Lionheart's designs, the hull is mostly composite fiber rather than metal, sacrificing armor strength for the sake of lighter weight and faster movement."
	description "This vessel is also capable of using tactical cloaking when it finds itself being the hunted, rather than the hunter."

	description "The Megaparsec Quicksilver is a warship built around a single concept: to design the smallest and fastest ship capable of carrying two particle cannons.

	description "When the Quicksilver finds it too far out of range of its intended target, it can always engage its cloak for a short time to close the distance."

	description "Named for the Goddess of rain, misery, shadow and sorrow, this Republic missile boat comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Achlys serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

	description "The Lionheart Raven is their most popular warship, an agile and elegant vessel that can nevertheless deal out and absorb considerable damage.

	description "After decades of capturing and ransoming Star Queens, the shipyards on Haven came into an overabundance of otherwise useless transports. Initial attempts to rent these out as stationary luxury apartments fell flat, so it was decided to convert these into combat vessels. Unsurprisingly, its sold with the same outfits it had when captured."
	description "	Once stripped of its luxury resources, the Star Queen proved a surprisingly sturdy and nimble hull. Although lightly armed even by frigate standards, the Endeavors engine space and shield strength can almost rival a cruisers, landing it squarely in the Destroyer range."

	description "The Betelgeuse Shipyards Firebird is a warship with a long and storied past; Firebirds fought on both sides of the Alpha Wars over half a millennium ago, and although the equipment and systems have been upgraded continuously since then, the basic design remains almost the same. The Firebird is also a very rugged ship and easy to repair; supposedly a few of the Firebirds that fought in those wars are still in service today."

	description "Named for an ancient diety of speed and riding the line between frigate and destroyer, this cutting edge vessel mixes the drone capacity of an Aletheia with the speed of a considerably smaller ship. This speed comes at the cost of hull and shield strength. Unlike other Navy designs, the Zephyrus functions best in a Cutter or Scout role and should only be used in combat roles in a pinch, and is the largest ship currently capable of cloaking."

	description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Syndicate engineering. It is basically nothing more than six turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defense platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

	description `The Protector was a commercial flop, too slow to properly protect a convoy, and too weak to protect itself. The Syndicate has since begun retrofitting their massive, slow vessels to instead serve as carriers for their hit Barb and Thorn fighters.`
	description `	By trimming down the turret ports and converting the extra power to engines, the Aegis is considerably faster than its base ship, and can carry as many fighters as Southbound's Skein.`

	description `The Vanguard is Syndicated Systems' newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defense market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it.`

	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance."
	description "	Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is normally only for sale to citizens who have been vetted by the local government of the Deep."

	description "The Quarg's famed 'Qa'kiil,' better known by humans as the Chimera, is a rare sight in human space. This ship is capable of taking on entire fleets of Human ships single handedly. Because of this, the Quarg are required to get permission from the Republic before sending one of these vessels anywhere in human space."
	description "	Many conspiracy theorists wonder why the Quarg would abide by such regulations and laws if they are so powerful."

	description "The Betelgeuse revision of the Narcissus really hit the mark with the Republic in the late days of the Civil War as a faster, lighter support ship capable of punching above its weight class."
	description "The upgrade goes well beyond improvements to its shields alone. The MKIII now has a considerably more efficient cloak, lighter components, and has traded out its cargo hold for more weapons or engine space."

	description "After the plans of the Headhunter were stolen by the Northern Union, they set about trying to make the vessel fit their needs even better. Mostly, of course, by sacrificing its cargo space."
