	description "Although all known hyperspace routes have been mapped for quite some time, pilots licenses are still loaded without them in order to encourage exploration, and as a way for local governments to make money."
	description "	This data chip for your pilots license contains complete information on the star systems closest to this one: planets, ports, trade prices, available services, etc. You can get all the same information just by exploring those systems yourself, but having a map can save you from making wrong turns if you are trying to travel through new territory to reach a certain system quickly."

	description `When designing the Barb, the Syndicate took the opportunity to integrate their smallest thruster models to create a more compact steering and thrusting engine. The result is not very useful on anything but a fighter, and is only "adequate" in that role. Still, if engine space is at a premium, this is the smallest set of engines that will still get you there (eventually).`

It is also used in larger ships, such as freighters, that have very little space for propulsion systems or energy to drive them. But these larger ships move unbearably slowly as a result."

	description "In the early years of the space era, settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	The Deep Sky Beam Laser was developed before the advent of energy shielding, but is now most useful as a mining laser. It is worth noting that while cockpits are designed to shield the pilot from laser emissions, it is still considered rude to try and point the laser in the enemy's eye."

While capable of a high fire rate, this gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description "Although not the most accurate or destructive of weapons, the Energy Blaster is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

	description "	The Deep Sky Beam Laser was developed before the advent of energy shielding, but is now most useful as a mining laser. It is worth noting that while cockpits are designed to shield the pilot from laser emissions, it is still considered rude to try and point the laser in the enemy's eye."

	description "A Blaster Turret is a pair of Energy Blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

It's worth noting that the closer you are to the star, the faster fuel will accumulate."
	description "	Unfortunately, there is a rule of diminishing returns with Ramscoops. Adding more will allow you to harvest more of the existing fuel, but will not guarentee you more to harvest. Meaning every ramscoop installed after the first could just be wasted outfit space."
