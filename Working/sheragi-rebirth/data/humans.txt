	description "The age old design of the Firebird was once one of the most common ships during the alpha wars. As such it was one of the few designs the Humans that fled to Sheragi space had access to. After half a millenium this ship has recieved heavy design tweaks to make it better able to stand up against the Behemoth Sheragi warships."

	description `The Tycho Crater Cooperative's Dromedary was one of the foremost colonization ships during the early era before piracy became rampant and triggered the necessity for city-ships to be more combat-oriented. These ships incorporate extensive hydroponics, large construction equipment installations, and hundreds of densely packed "dream cells" built to transport people in bulk.`

	description "The Llama is pushing the bounds of what can be considered a fighter by Human standards. It was created when it became apparant that a fighter needed to not immediatley disintegrate from a stray Sheragi shot. So that the model would never become obsolete, Shio Industries took inspiration from the Mule and decided to put a little bit of everything into this fighter, resulting in its bizarre appearance."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."
