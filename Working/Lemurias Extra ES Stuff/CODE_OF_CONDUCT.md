# Code of Conduct

As of now, LEESt is being developed by just one person,
Lemuria. When submitting pull requests or filing issues,
please:

- Be nice.


We trust you have learnt of the *golden rule*, which is
to treat others as you wish to be treated.


## Ukraine

We are fully aware of the war, but LEESt devs would like to
remain neutral regarding the conflict, and focus on developing
the plugin.
