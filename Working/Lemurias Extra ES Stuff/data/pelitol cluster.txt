planet "Eteristra"
	landscape "land/eteristra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Eteristra is an undeveloped planet in the Pelitol Cluster. Eteristra acts primarily as a nature reserve."
	spaceport "The spaceport here is primitive, with very few landing pads. Most traffic into the planet descends into the atmosphere to land in places far away from the spaceport, presumably to record the planet's wildlife (of which a sizable chunk was imported from Earth)."

planet "Delistra"
	landscape "land/delistra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Delistra is an undeveloped colony. Oratelis is of significant research interest however, so this planet is used as a hub for swarms of Surveillance Drones to enter space and scan the other planets."
	spaceport "The spaceport does not have much room for normal ships, but there are plenty of automated surveillance drone swarms."

planet "Moristra"
	landscape "land/moristra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Moristra is the northernmost colony in the Pelitol Cluster. Moristra is primarily an agricultural colony with the exception of the spaceport city, where the farmer's market resides (it takes up over 75% of the spaceport city's space)."
	spaceport "Moristra's spaceport is home to the farmer's market, where farmers sell their crops and the occasional tractor salesman approaches you, and asks if you want one. Notably, Moristra has very strong right-to-repair laws for tractors and farm equipment, so there are countless facilities where farmers modify their equipment or watch as repairmen, experienced or not, repair their equipment."

planet "Kaistra"
	landscape "land/kaistra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Even deeper into the Pelitol Cluster, is the planet of Kaistra. Kaistra is an even smaller outpost, a mere mining colony."
	spaceport "Kaistra's spaceport consists of a few landing pads, and the minimum required facilities."

planet "Defal VI Station"
	landscape "land/space2"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "This is an outpost. With more migration to the Pelitol Cluster, the SPA is discussing plans to convert this into a fuel generation factory, leeching off Defal VI, the gas giant that this outpost orbits. The station, located in the rings of Defal VI, is equipped with cannons on all sides to protect the station from asteroid impacts."
	spaceport "As standard procedure, there are fuel pumps. Not many people are here, and you feel like you're in a distant region of space. There is only one ship docked. The crew seem friendly and even let you view one of their plushies. Even in remote space, Freya Winters plushies run rampant."

planet Perechra
	landscape "land/perechra"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Perechra is an Earth-like world and the easternmost world in the Pelitol Cluster. With a population of 12,000, the world's facilties are primitive and meet only the barebones basic standards of medicine, hygiene and other critical services. Perechra is most often used as a rest stop for ships making their way to either Kaistra or Salistra."
	spaceport "The spaceport is barebones, with just 5 landing pads for large ships. You see 4 small ships on one of the landing pads. People here give you weird looks, since not many people land often. Dental offices, shopping centers, and even a small hospital are visible from where you currently are."

	shipyard "Sayari Heliarch Ships"

	government "Sayari Plushie"
	description "Salistra is an Earth-like world in the Pelitol Cluster. Salistra is primarily a farming, manufacturing, and shipbuilding world. Salistra is home to the Salistra Shipyard in orbit. The colony of Kaistra in the neighbouring Sarut system is the Salistra Shipyard's primary source of material."
	spaceport "The Salistra Spaceport is located on an island in the middle of one of Salistra's large oceans."

planet "Pondar"
	government "Independent"
	landscape "land/pondar"
	description "Pondar is a very remote part of human space located at the southernmost part of the Pelitol Cluster. Settled in roughly 26-27th century CE with 300 colonists, Pondar is now home to 9,210 people and serves as a hotspot for pirate and CSSF activity. The CSSF and pirate warlords operate their own bases on Pondar."
	spaceport "Pondar's spaceport is one of three ports on this planet. The other ports belong to the CSSF and pirate warlords respectively."

planet "Aylar"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	landscape "land/aylar"
	description "Aylar is a small SPA-owned rest stop with less than 500 people."
	spaceport "Your ship is refueled by the workers. Food is available at the spaceport for cheap."

planet "Voreo"
	government "Republic"
	landscape "land/voreo"
	description "Voreo is a Republic outpost, presumably to keep an eye on the activities of the Sayari Plushie Authority in the Pelitol Cluster. It's unclear how they are able to circumvent the patrols of the Sayari Plushie Authority, though."
	spaceport "Voreo's spaceport is designed more for large ships. Soldiers and officers in Republic uniforms dominate the landscape, but thankfully are nice enough to refuel and repair your ship at no cost."

planet Barachen
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	landscape "land/barachen"
	shipyard "Sayari Advanced"
	outfitter "Sayari Outfits"
	description "Barachen is an ocean world where roughly 85% of the surface is an ocean. Small settlements are present on most of Barachen's islands, home to a few plushie stashes and factories, most of which are well-hidden."
	description "One of the larger island chains is home to a massive SPA naval base, the spaceport, and shipyard, presumably to intimidate the Republic outpost on Voreo."
	description "Barachen's factories rival the factories of Zarkxaa in the production of Sayari plushies and merchandise. If Zarkxaa was to be occupied, Barachen would only need to increase it's production to make up for the lost supply."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located in the civilian area of the SPA naval base. The surrounding settlement is roughly 300,000 strong. As usual, large turrets have been placed on the naval base for protection against CSSF attacks. The shipyard is closely integrated with the naval base."
	spaceport "Meanwhile, the spaceport village offers several services such as food, drinks, ship repairs, and most importantly, plushies of either Freya Winters or Sayari. The traffic at the spaceport is fairly light with a ship entering roughly every 4 minutes."
