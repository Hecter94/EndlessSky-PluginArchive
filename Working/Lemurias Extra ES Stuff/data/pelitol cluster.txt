	description `Today, most of the draconian measures implemented by the SPA such as martial law when they eventually gained full control are repealed; but a few of those measures still exist.`
	description `In the planet's orbit, there are a few hundred orbital turrets which are derelict and abandoned; leftovers from Bardanistra's resistance. They are not enough of a nuisance to the planet's orbital volume yet as to warrant a salvage operation.`
	spaceport `Bardanistra's spaceport is located outside the main city. There are still several turrets left over from when the colony held out against the Sayari Plushie Authority, but some have already been upgraded to modern turrets. The security checkpoints, normally absent on other SPA planets, are still running, another leftover security measure from the old martial law era.`
	spaceport `Near the spaceport lies a large SPA-owned military base, shipyard, and outfitter. The security is a bit more intense than the regular spaceport. The roof of the SPA-owned military base has significantly more turrets than the rest, which are of significantly higher quality.`

The station's docking ports are continually crowded with ships and tourists. Ships wanting to enter the station during peak hours sometimes wait in planetary orbit due to the unbearable traffic. The main spaceport building itself is a replica of the Hotel de Ville.`
	spaceport `The nearby shops sell items related to France, such as baguettes, croissants, and other French items. The spaceport is the only settlement on this planet, home to roughly 11,000 people, the rest left barren and uninhabited. The signs are twice as large, as they have both English and French text.`

Not to be confused with Tarsia in the neighboring Vachrau system or Tarazed.`
	description `The forest surrounding the city is home to several native species of trees. It is for this reason that ships are inspected closely for the presence of any invasive species.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Taraz is located in a small exclave surrounded by the nature reserve. From space, a line of deforested land can be seen running between the spaceport and the Taraz metropolitan area. This strip of land is the only major route and is high traffic with a large team of air traffic controllers coordinating spaceship traffic along the route.`

planet Gura
	landscape "land/gura"
	government "Republic"
	description `The culture of Gura is mostly influenced by Japanese culture. Gura is a colony of hundreds of millions.`
	spaceport `Gura has several spaceports scattered along the equator in place of a single large spaceport. Several industrial complexes on the surface have their own spaceport facilities.`

planet "Pareia"

	government Republic
	attributes "nature reserve" religious
	description `Pareia is a large planetwide nature reserve. Most of the planet's species are imported from Earth. Small groups of Amish reside on this relatively undeveloped planet in the areas open to settlement.`
	spaceport `Pareia's spaceport is primitive. Not many ships land here on the very few landing pads available, which even then are simple concrete pads, instead of more advanced high-tech landing pads used on other worlds.`

	outfitter "Basic Outfits"
	attributes military
	description `Steirek is a militarized world. It is for the exclusive use of the Sayari Plushie Authority. Steirek consists of a large network of warehouses, datacenters, and supercomputers providing storage for plushies and data and computing power to help the SPA choose the best place to sell plushies based on its models of the galaxy, which rival that of the Syndicate.`
	spaceport `The vast majority of the ships leaving and entering the spaceport are in the livery of the Sayari Plushie Authority and your ship sticks out amongst the crowd. Containers full of plushies can be seen being loaded onto the ships. The spaceport is defended by hundreds of turrets to protect against CSSF and pirate intrusions.`

planet Ponarai

	government "Sayari Plushie"
	attributes farming frontier
	description `Ponarai is a relatively undeveloped world. The Sayari Plushie Authority has imported several species from Earth onto this world; modifying the biosphere in hopes of finding a new material that can be used to produce plushies.`
	spaceport `Ponarai's spaceport is fairly primitive; some ships can even be seen directly on the ground; without a landing pad.`

planet Narchrai
	landscape "land/narchrai"
	government "Sayari Plushie"
	attributes urban forest
	description `Narchrai's population density is unusually high. Untouched grasslands and forests still cover over 90% of the surface, the remaining 10% being a single continuous metropolitan area home to large buildings. Collectively, these large buildings host roughly hundreds of millions of people.`
	spaceport `Narchrai's primary spaceport is located atop the city's tallest building. The immense size of the spaceport shrouds the nearby buildings into darkness for a few kilometers extending out from the center.`

planet "Pechara High"
	landscape "land/stationPecharaHigh"
	government "Independent"
	attributes station
	description `Pechara High is sparsely populated. Only roughly 40 people live here to maintain the station and perform research. It orbits the gas giant Pechara, which was expelled from its star system likely hundreds of millions of years ago. An even bigger mystery is why the hyperlane network would lead to such an isolated and lonely gas giant.`
	spaceport `The spaceport consists primarily of equipment for launching scientific probes alongside standard refuelling facilities.`

planet Brigantium
	landscape "land/brigantium"
	government "Republic"
	attributes research
	description `Brigantium is home to the Brigantium Computing Array: a network of supercomputers across the surface, capable of running highly intensive simulations, using the water as a heatsink. The Array is powered by a partial Dyson sphere, the sole source of power in the Brigantium system.`
	description `The Brigantium Computing Array, while primarily used for scientific research, has had a part of its computing power rented out for a variety of purposes such as rendering of extremely high-quality images and movies, simulation of galactic trade prices and combat simulations. Over 99.8% of Brigantium's permanent population consist of people who maintain the Array alongside their families and close relatives.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Brigantium is located on top of one of the array's largest nodes. There is a relatively high demand for electronics to replace some of the failing parts of the Array, and data-chips containing high quality images, rendered by the array at extremely high resolutions, so high that even at 500x zoom level the image was still 4K.`
	spaceport `Many PC shops here sell parts taken from decommissioned Array servers, alongside prebuilt machines using the very same parts.`

planet Lattice
	landscape "land/lattice"
	government "Republic"
	attributes rich urban
	description `Lattice is primarily an upscale colony, with the vast majority of the population being either rich or retired. Most of the planet's poorer population originate from the other parts of the Pelitol cluster; it is essentially an enclave of the Paradise Worlds.`
	spaceport `The spaceport of Lattice contains many luxury stores, most of which are prohibitively expensive.`

planet Bredehoft
	landscape "land/bredehoft"
	government "Republic"
	description `The colony of Bredehoft, at the northeast of the Pelitol Cluster, is often nicknamed the law capital of the Cluster, due to its higher concentrations of lawyers compared to the other planets. It is sometimes said by the locals that a long bloodline of lawyers reside on this planet, going back to 21st century Earth.`
	description `Bredehoft is an Earth-like planet with a roughly 1:1 ratio of land and water.`
	spaceport `Law firms have built several large buildings near the main spaceport, acting as their headquarters. The main planetary court of Bredehoft resides at the very periphery of the spaceport, consisting of several buildings and courtrooms, with a direct link to the spaceport and even landing pads of its own for particularly troublesome defendants, criminals, or plaintiffs.`
	spaceport `Aside from the court, the spaceport is closely integrated with the planet's largest city, home to roughly 30% of the population.`

planet "Couric"
	landscape "land/couric"
	government "Pirate"
	description `Couric is a Pirate world, used as a rallying point for attacks against the Republic or the Sayari Plushie Authority to the west. The vast majority of Couric is controlled by a single syndicate. First landed on by a local pirate warlord known as Raugan in 2994 in an attempt to evade pursuit.`
	spaceport `Couric has no single spaceport; spaceports are spread out across the planet for redundancy in the event of a hostile planetary attack.`
