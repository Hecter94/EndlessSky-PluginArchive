	description "Once one of the most popular interceptor-class ships, the Berserker's popularity is now waning in favor of more modern and versatile ships like the Hawk. Although limited numbers are still produced by Betelgeuse Shipyards, most Berserkers that are in service today are more than half a century old. This Berserker clearly was built with mining in mind."

	description "The Carrier is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Carrier can also do significant damage in close combat."
	description "This is yet another SPA-built variant of the Carrier, since it seems they have an affinity for Republic ships due to their firepower."

	description "This ship was first built millennia ago, near the end of a more violent time in Hai history. Since then, it has served as the only heavy warship at the disposal of the Hai. The Shield Beetle is a versatile warship used by the Hai to guard their merchant convoys, or by the Unfettered to attack those very same convoys."
	description "Naturally, the SPA has taken advantage of this versatility, replacing all the gun ports with Syndicate Proton Guns, more specifically, 10 of them, which can be used to deadly effect."

	description `This particular cockpit and engine set has found itself attached to three of Southbound Shipyards' new "Type F" Fighter-carrier pods. When the Free Worlds asked for a carrier, they did not expect one that would be able to carry more fighters than even the heaviest Navy warships. Given this fact, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound and Tarazed to restrict sale of the "Hauler III: Type F", "Skein" to its Militia only.`
	description `This is a modified variant, built by the SPA for its needs. Fleets that need to transport plushies in questionable situations (such as when the CSSF is patrolling a particular system), often use this particular variant of the Skein.`
	description `The Sayari Plushie Authority is willing to sell this ship to anyone with enough money, without the need for a militia license from the Free Worlds.`
