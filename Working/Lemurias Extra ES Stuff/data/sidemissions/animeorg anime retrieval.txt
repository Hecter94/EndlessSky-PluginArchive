			`	You leave your ship, opening the hatch. You recall that the worker had informed you that the private collector would be in the visitor center. So, you begin marching across the docking bays of Alexandria, eventually arriving in the spaceport's visitor center, after a short brisk walk.`
			`	As you scan the room in search for the mysterious collector, you spot a middle-aged woman dressed in a white pantsuit waving at you, the buttons on her suit jacket's sleeves occasionally visible, reflecting light into your eyes. She must be the private collector. You approach her table and take a seat on the other side.`
			`	"Are you the captain the Anime Organization sent to pick up the anime?", asks the lady.`
			`	"Yes, they sent me here.", you reply.`
			`	"I'll have the dockworkers load the anime onto your ship. After this, you are to return to <planet>."`
			`	"Got it."`
			`	You stand up to return to your ship, the woman following at the same pace as you. By the time you arrive, dockworkers have already opened your ship's hatch, with large crates of anime being loaded. Once all is done, you board your ship, wish the woman well, and prepare to transport the anime back to <planet>.`

			`	As your ship begins deorbiting, you receive a special message from Eisei Control, directing you to land on a separate hangar. As you exit the hatch, the same Anime Organization worker walks in with his clipboard. Once he approaches close enough, he extends a credit chip with <payment> from his uniform's pocket and gives it to you.`
			`	"I'll have the dock workers unload the anime from your ship very soon. Be patient. Anyways, thank you for your contribution to anime history. Your efforts are not in vain. The anime that you have transported will be lovingly preserved by our archivists. I wish you the best in your future endeavors.`
			`	You sit back as the dockworkers begin unloading the cargo, with a great deal of care so as to not damage the data drives. After what seems like a few hours of painstakingly careful unloading, the hangar door opens and you return to the primary spaceport, leaving you to ponder your next move.`
