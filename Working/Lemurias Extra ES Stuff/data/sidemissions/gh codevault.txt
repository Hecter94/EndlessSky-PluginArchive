		log "Factions" "GitHub" "GitHub was an organization founded in the 21st century. During the early 21st century, they distributed computer code via a development model called 'open source'. GitHub as an organization collapsed during the 23rd century. In addiiton to the distribution of computer code, GitHub also assisted in the development of large projects, often developed by multiple people, by making use of an ancient 'version control system' known as Git."

		log "Minor People" "Linus Torvalds" "Software engineer born on Earth in the 20th century (c. 1965 - 1970). Known mostly for his effort in developing the 'Linux kernel', development of which continues well in the 31st century. 95% of computers in human space run operating systems that use the Linux kernel."

		log "Minor People" "John" "Another software engineer who claims to be proficient in 'C'. He approached you at the spaceport bar and gave you information about GitHub and programming when the GitHub Code Vault was opened up 1000 years after it's inception."

		log "Spaceport was quiet once more. Thankfully, it wasn't another rebellion just like the Free Worlds. Workers on Earth apparently opened up some old time capsule full of crates all labelled 'GitHub'. Some guy named John told me it was called the 'GitHub Code Vault'. All of it was code. Just code. He made a point to say that the first program that they 'compiled' was the 'Linux kernel'."

		conversation
			`As you land at the spaceport, you find that it is eerily quiet once more. You enter the spaceport bar and on one of the screens is a news broadcast showing a group of workers unloading several crates all labelled "GitHub" from an unknown location in the Arctic on Earth.`
			
			`	"Over 1000 years ago, our ancestors gathered more than 200 million "repositories" of code and preserved them in what they called the 'Arctic Code Vault'. According to archaeologists, GitHub was an ancient organization whose sole purpose was to distribute computer code across the world, via a model of development known as 'open source'.", says the news anchor.`
			
			`Just as you are about to leave, one of the patrons in the bar grab your shoulder. "They're opening the box!", says the patron. You gaze back at the screen. Several computer experts inspect the first box. The camera pans towards another label on the box. The label is as follows:`
			
			`		Repository: torvalds/linux`
			`		ID: #90939-40093`
			
			`The same patron introduces himself as 'John'. He sees that you are visibly confused, so he asks you if you have a question. "You confused? Well, I've been programming in C since the 2990s so I'd say I'm quite knowledgeable."`

			`	"Open-source is basically a model of development where the source code of the project is offered to anyone free of charge, usually under a permissive license. This is in contrast to proprietary software, where nobody except the developer or company who created it is allowed access to the source code.", John says.`

			`	"Well, you must be confused. torvalds/linux was the repository for something called the Linux kernel. At the core of most of the computers that run our ships, such as the targeting, navigation and shield harmonics computers, is the Linux kernel. The Linux kernel has changed so much over the past 1000 years."`
			`	"Meanwhile, the 'torvalds' in the name refers to the owner of the repository, a human known as Linus Torvalds. He was the creator of the Linux kernel until he handed over control of the project to his family. Nowadays, there are several forks of it.", John says.`
			`	"Well, that explains everything.", you say in response.`

			`	"Repositories are folders which are being tracked by version control systems. This allows programmers to keep track of their code and log changes being made to it. In this particular case, Git was the version control system in question, which Linus Torvalds built for the Linux kernel, after they stopped using a software called 'BitKeeper'. Archival copies of BitKeeper and Git are still available on Alexandria, I suppose."`

It directs you to a little-used corner of the station, where you find a datachip labelled 'Git'. There's a logo on it, which says 'git' in lowercase, so you're sure you have the right chip. You discreetly make a copy of it and install it on your ship's computer remotely. If you ever need to do some programming, Git will be there for you. A quick version check reveals that the datachip has version 43.11 of Git installed."
