			"You've landed on Eisei. Unlike the nearby Sayari Plushie Authority colonies, this is owned by a different organization. As usual, your ship is refueled. Suddenly, an announcement plays."

			"Reading directions on a poster, you walk to the theater. Many people walk alongside you, from the disreputable-looking to well-dressed people. Some of them have rifles, but you don't think of it. Some people in the crowd buy snacks and drinks, while you go straight to the cinema. You're briefed on the rules, such as remaining quiet at all times, and not littering."
			"The anime they screen is good. After what feels like a few hours, the screening concludes as the end credits roll and you return to your ship, ready to leave."
