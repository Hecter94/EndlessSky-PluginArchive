	description `Although not quite as strong or powerful as the Quarg ships that they are designed to oppose, Heliarch Punishers are versatile and durable ships. Rumors say that the Heliarchs have a small stash of stolen Quarg Skylances that they can outfit the Punishers with in times of war.`

	description `Anyone who incurs the wrath of the Heliarchs cannot count on making a fast getaway thanks to the Interdictors, which were primarily designed to carry a pair of attractor and repulsor beams that can hold a ship a safe distance away while pushing it around enough to prevent it from getting a hyperspace lock to jump out of the system.`

	description `During their time battling the Quarg, the Coalition focused on producing the strongest, toughest warships they could, so fightercraft were out of the question. Now, however, the Heliarch's shield matrix and hull integrity technology is much more advanced, and they have recently experimented with such ships. The Judicator was made for transportation of these new fighters.`
	description `	Alongside their six fighter bays, Judicators come with a large bunk count and higher cargo space than other Heliarch warships, thus doubling as a logistics vessel for transporting troops and equipment.`
