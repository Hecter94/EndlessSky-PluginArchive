		log Factions "Sayari Plushie Authority" `The Sayari Plushie Authority is a megacorporation that has assumed governance of the entire Illumina Regions. As the name suggests, the Authority's primary product is a plushie of Sayari. However, it also derives significant profit from mining and taxing the people who live on its planets. According to them, Sayari was a squirrel-like character from a 1000-year old anime.`
			`While its worlds are technically part of the Republic, the Authority governs itself without much interference from the Republic's parliament. Since the Authority's navy has the ability to easily decimate the entire Republic, it has mostly been left to govern itself and is considered an independent country, a major government in its own right just like the Free Worlds and the Syndicate (a fellow megacorporation).`
