The Republic and the Deep remain baffled as to how pirates were able to obtain a large amount of Bactrians."

Annoyed dockworkers aside, merchants haggle for hours on end with sellers to get the lowest possible price.

The slave trade has proliferated deep within the planet's mantle. Amongst the inhabitants, there is rumor that deep in the nearby uninhabited systems lies an entrance to an alien civillization. No explorer has been daring enough to investigate this, and it is often dismissed as mere nonsense. Due to the large shipyards here, it is a popular stopping point for captains who wish to purchase new ships or upgrades."

In light of this, there are many mining operations on this planet and most of the residents here are either miners or their families, with the exception of the occasional rich person who you assume is one of the supervisors. Another part of the planet that seems to trigger you is the immense temperature differences between day and night (59 & -77 C respectively)."

You're in one of the few spaceport complexes open to the general public, but even here you can still purchase a few ships and some decent outfits."
	spaceport "The spaceport is full of ships decked out in the livery of the Sayari Plushie Authority, but you can see a few merchant ships, if any.

	spaceport "The spaceport is so loud that you were stopped and boarded by a SPA ship, during which you and your crew were all instructed to wear ear protection before coming this close to the spaceport.

There are many crew here who normally would belong on Kestrix I or on Leroo Station. You do meet a few friendly merchant captains who want to trade."
