# Growing up in LEEST space
LEEST equivalent of https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/HumanSpace basically.

## Martieu
Your family is insanely religious, most likely Christian. Before every little activity you pray, sometimes for much longer than the duration of the activity. Depending on how religious your family were, you were taught that God created the universe 7000 years ago. As far as you know, you've never met a same-sex couple. Or an atheist. And every Sunday you went to church, to listen to long and uninspiring sermons. Your parents watched with glee while you only silently listened, not being enthusiastic at all. On some weeks, your knees would hurt from the kneeling the congregation did while praying.

## Sayari Plushie Authority
You probably had a normal childhood. From a young age you always had a squirrel plushie, and everybody else at school had one of their own too. Your parents worked in large textile factories manufacturing Sayari-related merchandise such as the squirrel plushie you always slept with. Regarding religion, you were most likely raised as an atheist, as with many of your children (but sometimes there were Muslims or Christians present). The Sayari Plushie Authority was a name you'd always recognized; in fact it was so omnipresent that it may have been the first word you learned to read, long before you uttered the word *mama*.
