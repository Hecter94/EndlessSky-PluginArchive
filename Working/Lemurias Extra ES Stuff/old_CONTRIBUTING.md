## Fleet, mission names
### Fleet
```
faction.purpose.name.size.num
```
* `faction`: fleet's faction. use short names for long full names (free worlds becomes fw, sayari plushie authority becomes spa)
* `purpose`: purpose of fleet such as mining, fighting wars, or trading
* `name`: any kind of name
* `size`: size of fleet, solely based on ship count, `lrg, med, sml`; definition of size can be subjective
* `num`: for specifying different variants if more precise control instead of `variant #num` desired

If two variants of a fleet exist, you may have them under 1 fleet as a variant or define them separately for more precise control.
