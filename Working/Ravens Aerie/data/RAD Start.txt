	description `You grew up on Ravens Aerie in the Tortor system. The RA Defense Force were your heroes growing up and you were thrilled when you were old enough to enlist in the academy and get commisioned in the RAD Space Force. Despite your outstanding piloting marks, or maybe because of them you'd found yourself assigned to a succession of schools and flight training programs. Your junior rank insured you got stuck with most of the paperwork and ground instruction while the senior instructors got vast majority of the flight time. After six years you'd had enough and unable to gain a transfer to a combat unit you'd regretfully filed your resignation. As luck would have it your training unit needed a U-Dart ferried back to Ravens Aerie from their current location on Kringel so you at least were going to get one last flight in the pilots seat before your military career ground to it's conclusion.`

conversation "Ravens Aerie intro"
	`	You'd cleared Kringels controlled space without a hitch and it looked like it would be a boring couple hours cruise back to Ravens Aerie. That is until you symultaniously noticed a rather battered looking light freighter making a crash entry in system from hyperspace and the Guard frequency squawking the alert for inbound hostiles. Sure enough there were 3 Headhunters with pirate markings making rapid transitions in system right behind the Light Freighter and their weapons were already cycling up. Without a second thought you redlined your engines your pitiful energy blasters crackling as they spat their tiny bolts at the lead headhunter as you desperately tried to insert your ship between the trio of Pirates and the civilian freighter. Last thing you remember was the horrendous sound of metal shredding under the impacts of multiple Particle Cannons and the spinecrushing blow of the automated ejections system blasting you free from the wreckage that had been your ship. A final thought before you passed out was thank god they didn't get that freighter with those shots.`

	`You wake up in a strange room, quiet beeps from some machine catch your attention and with a quick glance about you realize your in a medical bay.`
	`"Ah Lieutenant your finally awake, that's good to see."`
	`You start trying to get out of bed and come to attention when you see the dark skinned man in uniform who is addressing you, but he quickly tells you to lay at ease.`

	`"Had quiet the trip there lieutenant, and while the RAD Space Corps IS known for their galant bravery I don't think I've ever seen someone take a lone U-Dart up against three headhunters. Least not do so and live to tell the tale. He gives you a tioght little smile, anyways Ravens Aerie owes you a great debt of gratitude for your galentry. While I understand you've resigned your commision I'd like to propose a deal for you to perhaps pay some of that debt."`
	`"The doctor has cleared you to leave if you just sign this paperwork, once that's done I'll explain what I meant about owing you a Debt and our attempt to repay it."`

	`	As you finish signing the paperwork the man introduces himself as Colonel Stephen`
	`	With paperwork completed and after getting dressed you meet Colonel Stephen outside the Med Bay you woke up in and he starts talking as he guides you along the corridors of an enormous ship.`
	`	"The ship you saved from getting shot up is Gypsy, she's been owned by the royal family for over a century now. The 3rd Princess was flying her when you made your heroic rescue attempt. She was suppossed to be heading to Prime in Republic Space but instead slipped the pair of Crusaders assigned to protect her and headed for Danoa thinking that would be more fun."`
	`	"Obviously she had a bit more excitement than she anticipated but thanks, in no small part to you, survived her little adventure."`
	`	"While her father still needs her to go to prime for these negotiations, she's not allowed to fly herself there and he's announced that the royal familly is selling Gypsy."`
	`	"As these are suppossed to be low key negotiations transporting the Princess in a large military ship such as this Stormbringer Heavy Warship would draw far to much and all the wrong types of attention."`
	`	"That of course is reason she was allowed to take Gypsy in the first place, and where you come in Lieutenant."`
	`	"We still feel a small freighter like Gypsy is best choice to get her safely there with minimum notice. Especially if it's been made very public knowledge that the Royal family has sold Gypsy to an independent captain and no longer has any ties to her." He gives you a broad smile and wink at that last comment.`
	`	Exiting the Giant Stormbringer Colonel Stephen leads you across the landing pads to where the small scarred ship you tried to rescue is parked.`
	`	Doesn't look like much from out here I know but the royal family has put a few tricks under that motley skin, accept this mission of transporting our impetuous 3rd Princess where she needs to go and getting her there on time, and without any more little adventures, and Gypsy here is all yours once you complete the mission.`
	`"Just remember that even though your officially out of the RAD Space Corps we still expect you to ensure that the Princess gets to Prime on time."`
