planet "Ravens Aerie"
	attributes north frontier
	landscape land/city1
	description `A cold planet, with dense foggy atmosphere, and a rugged landscape of towering volcanic ranges and large storm wracked oceans. After decades spent fighting pirates and exploring the galaxy Douglas Stormraven cut a deal with a then young Republic government to the exclusive rights to this system. He then set about colonizing and establishing the  corporate headquarters and main "manufacturing" facilities of Stormraven Enterprizes which incorporates a number of alien technologies in its designs. This was several centuries ago and it's location on the very fringes of Republic space have made it all but forgotten by most until recently.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is set on a large man made peninsula that juts out protecting the harbor of "Raven Erie" the planetary capitol which is a surprisingly sleek and modern looking city that climbs up the face of the towering mountains behind it`

planet "Plush"
	attributes north frontier
	landscape land/lava10
	description `This high gravity, volcanically active planet is only barely within tolerance for human habitation without resorting to completely sealed environement. The mining of various rare elements was reason for its original occupation. Now with the mining of the asteroids becoming commercially viable the mines on Plush are much less important to Ravens Aerie but the population of the planet now seems to take a perverse pride in fact that they live on such a hostile world`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a massive stepped pyramidal construct. The whole edifice built on top of a stabilized volcanic mesa in an attempt to protect it from both fresh volcanic eruptions from surrounding mountains which tend to flow into the vallies below and frequent earthquakes`

	description `Extreme geothermal activity and thick atmosphere are only things preventing this planet from becoming a solid ball of ice. A variety of Xeno fluara and fauna adapted to this planets extreme conditions were reason for it's original colonization. The fact that they turned out to be readily adaptable as sources of food and for a variety of medical applications has turned this frozen ocean world into the food center and medical hub of Ravens Aerie.`
	spaceport `Someone apparently indulged in a bit too much of the local pharmaceuticals when building the spaceport here as there alien "trees" decked out with a nultitude of different colored lights whereever you look and various pieces of art that seem to depict horned animals of some type hauling starships into orbit.`

planet "Sweet Tater"
	attributes north frontier
	landscape land/lava9
	description `The outermost and largest moon of the gas giant it orbits. The only reason this seismicly active chunk of rock is colonized is for scientific research purposes and to support mining and refinery operations both on planet and in the nearby asteroid belts. With it's very thin toxic atmosphere already unable to support human life environmental concerns over pollution from strip mining and heavy industrial refineries are more or less a non issue. Although confined to sealed environments much like on a space station, being on a planet allows far more room and ammenities than any but the largest of space stations can offer and the high average pay makes this a surprisingly popular place to reside in system.`
	spaceport `The domes of Sweet Tater are surrounded by landing fields. The largest ships will be connected to the domes by pressurized gangways that extend out, while majority of the smaller ships will most often be towed inside large sealed hangers.`
