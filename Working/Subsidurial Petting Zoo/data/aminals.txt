	description "Though Subsidurials are rare creatures, a small backwater farming culture has begun taming and caring for them. These tamed subsurdials are a bit chunkier and slower than their wild brethren, but they can be wrangled into a fighter bay with a bit of creative fitting. They're also more sensitive to pain, entering a faint state once they're injured too gravely, requiring expedient first aid."
	description "Tamed Subsidurials like these ones, are even, with some time spent dedicated to bonding and training, able to act as cargo ships, though the ethical implications of such animal labour are questionable."

	description "Because of their diet of spacerocks, Subsidurials need extremely strong stomach acid to maintain a reasonable metabolic rate. When spat at a ship, the results can be disastrous. Against fluid masses moving so slowly, shields won't trigger; thankfully, the spit itself doesn't do any direct damage, but it can cause considerable hull corrosion over time."

	description "Though tamed Subsidurials are typically lax and slow moving, they can become quite fast when enraged, breaking into the giant-space-cow equivalent of a sprint. This sprint, however, does quickly exhaust them."
