# A Coalition at War

You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg in Endless Sky, but you never see it. This plugin introduces a storyline that lets you see or join that conflict. You gain access to Quarg or Heliarch tech and warships depending on the side you choose.

You can start the first mission by landing on "Tebuteb's Table" (in the Tebuteb system) or Forpelog (in the Sadalsuud system) and accepting the anomaly mission.

This plugin is best enjoyed after finishing the Wanderer Campaign. Getting access to Tier 3 tech makes everything else basically irrelevant.

There's few missions right now. See "Contributing" below if you have any ideas for more missions.
