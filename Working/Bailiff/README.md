# Bailiff-plugin
My first plugin for the open source space exploration game, Endless Sky.

The intention is to provide an alternative means for a player to earn money and a way of punishing players who get too much into debt.

This first release has a very quick and dirty ship to be used as a Bailiff ship.  

Further changes to be implemented...

Some way of getting the Bailiff licence (I'll be testing the Bailiff ship first to refit with human outfits first)

Some way of getting Bailiff to chase impoverished players.
