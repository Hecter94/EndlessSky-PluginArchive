Debt Collector plugin TODO list

Bailiff Ship
Repurpose data from Korath World Ship in original game as Bailiff ship [DONE]
	Introduce Bailif as a ship that can be bought at a Sydicate shipyard.

Refit repurposed Korah World Ship with Human outfits...
	Atomic engines
	Beam weapons
	Suitable power and cooling outfits
	
	(get someone to) design a new sprite for the Bailiff to replace the Korath World Ship sprite.
	
Reposession missions
	Lock Bailiff behind a licence (do not publish plugin until this is done)
	
	Devise missions at appropriate levels to allow new players to work themselves up to a Bailiff licence.  
		Would reposession missions require a new government (Debtor) or would Bounty do?
		What sort of storyline could come about from this?
	
	Have invisible mission that triggers at credit level >= 200 where debt collectors at appropriate level (1 level above player level) chase down player to reposess ship.
		Implement way to have mission pay off loans rather than credit bank account.
			How would loans be paid off?  Pay off oldest first?  Largest first?  Death Benefits first?  Mortgage first?
	
	Devise relationships between other governments and Repo Agent government.
		Which government would be Friendly?  Hostile?  Neutral?
		Is there lore that would explain this?
	
What ifs.
	What if the original game devs design a Syndicate storyline which conflicts with this plugin?  Obsolete plugin.  Hopefully MZ and other devs will keep this plugin in mind and try not to break it, but they have no obligation to me.
