			`Just as you're stepping off of your ship, you hear a series of faint explosions, growing louder. You look around for a source, until a man in his early 20s bursts from a building, sliding past you, through your ship's hatch, and into your ship.`
			`	Not moments later, another explosion tears the building to the ground, and two individuals emerge from the wreckage. They are both dressed rather flamboyantly, and approach you quickly as soon as they see you.`
			`	"Are you the owner of this ship? We need to look inside for someone," one asks, while the other looks around impatiently.`
			choice
				`	"Yes, this is my ship."`
					goto yes
				`	"No, you can't come inside."`
			`	"This isn't funny, kid," the one retorts, "We think there is a criminal somewhere around here. We need to see if he somehow got onto your ship." The man couldn't explain the situation to you any further before his colleague simply pushes past you, onto your ship.`
				label yes
			`	The two men start searching every nook and cranny of your ship, showing some impressive strength, going as far as to flip over some beds to see if their "someone" is hiding under it. You think about trying to stop them from making such a mess, but just as you're finally building up the courage to threaten them, one of them says to the other,`
			`	"Tch, the bastard really isn't here, we've flipped the entire ship over and no sight of him," to which the other responds "The time we've been here is more time we gave him to run away, we can't fail this job. Let's get out of here and start checking the other ships."`
			`	With all said and done, they don't even apologize about the mess and head out your ship's hatch.`
			choice
				`	(Try to get them to make up for all the trouble.)`
					goto makeup
				`	(Say nothing and try to clean up the mess on your own.)`
					goto nothing

			label makeup
			`	"Hey! Where do you think you're going? You turn my ship's interior into a slum and just walk away? I'll report you to the authorities for this!" You say, to try and get them to come back.`
			`	The talkative of the two merely turns to you and gives you a menacing look as he starts talking, "Don't push your luck, punk. We don't need permission from any authority to look for someone messing with our business."`
			label nothing
			`	With no alternative, you start putting everything back in its place, folding bed sheets, making sure everything is in place, and go to the control panel in the cockpit to see if the ventilation system hasn't been compromised somehow. You try pushing the usual buttons, but it seems as if they're stuck, like something under the control panel is blocking the mechanism.`
			choice
				`	(Punch the control panel in frustration.)`
					goto punch
				`	(Open it up and inspect the damage.)`
			`	You grumble in frustration and begin unscrewing the panel to inspect the interior. Out of it comes a person, the very same young man who ran into your ship earlier. "Hey, what was that for? That was my hiding spot, I was hiding there!"`
				goto next
			label punch
			`	Irritated by all that happened, you don't think much about what to do and punch the side of the panel, in the unlikely chance that fixes it.`
			`	Much to your surprise, the control panel seems to have grunted in pain, you didn't even have time to go to the spaceport bar to get drunk, so you're in a state of shock for a few seconds. You punch the panel again to see if it replies again, and after your hand is already hurting from hitting the metal plates, the panel suddenly swings open in a way you didn't even know was possible.`
			`	Out of it comes a person, the very same young man who ran into your ship earlier. "Owww! What was that for? What kind of captain suddenly starts hitting their ship?"`
			label next
			`	You're pretty sure your control panel was not supposed to fit a human inside it, so you turn around slowly to check its interiors, as your fear becomes reality: every single component or cable has been removed from it- the controls are plugged to nothing.`
			choice
				`	(React.)`
				`	(Focus, calm down.)`
					goto focus
			`	Coupled with the two men earlier thrashing your ship, this sets you off, as you grab the young man by his shirt's collarbone with strength you didn't even know you had.`
			`	"What kind of captain hits their ship? What kind of jackass runs into someone else's ship and does that to their control panel? How am I going to fly this thing now? I don't know what you did to get those men looking for you, but you're not getting any help from me!"`
			label focus
			`	You start getting ready to just throw him out of your ship, but as you inspect the man a bit closer, you notice many bloody stains in his shirt, and see some blood dripping from his left head and left hand. You're still extremely angry about what he has caused, but if you don't help him now he could very well die.`
`	You lay him down on a bed and go grab some emergency medical supplies, you have a feeling that you shouldn't take him out of your ship to go to a hospital.`
			choice
				`	(Tend to his wounds yourself.)`
				`	(Take him to a hospital quickly.)`
					goto hospital
			apply
				set "fixed cables"
			`	After you've stopped the bleeding and made sure he's okay, you start questioning him, "Okay, first of all, who the hell are you? Second of all, why were those men chasing you, and why did they do this to my ship? And last, but the most important question if all, how the hell do you plan on paying for all the damage you've caused to my ship's systems?"`
			`	The man looks at you as if confused, and finally says "Isn't it rude to ask someone's name before telling them your own?"`
			`	You want to jump at his throat for not taking this seriously, but manage to calm yourself, "I'm <first> <last>. Starship captain if you can't tell. Who the hell are you?" a wide smirk forms in his face, as he lets out a short laugh before responding...`
			`	"Name's Joey Jordan, I'm running away from those guys."
			choice
				`	(React well.)`
				`	(React badly.)`
				`	(React terribly.)`
			`	"That's obvious! What I want to know is if I have a criminal or whatever on my ship now, or if you're being chased by some kind of street gang. And I need my systems fixed, so tell me how you'll pay for that!"`
			`	The man frowns a bit, as if disappointed, "Honestly <last>, you shouldn't be so serious, I just put those cables of yours away so that I could hide, they're in an air vent near the cockpit, I'll just put them back there once I'm back on my feet."`
			`	You're getting angrier by the second, and you're pretty sure that your blood pressure is above safe levels; your head hurts like hell. You decide to leave this "Joey" resting, as you lock the door to make sure he can't just run away without paying up for all the damage.`
			`	You calm down a bit once you find all the cables- they really were hidden in an air vent, and all seem to be in usable conditions- but no matter how hard you try to fit them inside the control panels you can't get even half of them in there, and even then you can't properly attach the wires.`
			`	You start looking out of the windows to try and cool down, and as you look out to the building you saw Joey running out of, you see that quite a crowd has gathered there. You look at some ships docked here and notice the two men from earlier coming out of one of them, much like how they left your own ship it seems. You then start thinking about how a certain Shuttle and Freighter have been here for a while, even though you saw cargo being loaded up in them and the crew apparently being there.`
			`	As you start looking at the local news you then find something unbelievable: the spaceport authorities have prohibited any ship from departing until they find "a certain suspicious individual, suspected to have been involved in the explosions."`
			`	You run back to the room where you left Joey, who is somehow already back on his feet, but as you try and get some answers, he just turns around and starts walking out, as he tells you "I'll go fix that minor inconvenience your ship has," speaking as if he's a mechanic going to repair some damage you did yourself, as opposed to making up for turning your ship into a scrap heap.`
			goto last

			label hospital
			apply
				clear "fixed cables"
			`	As quickly as you can, you hoist the man onto a stretcher and disembark to locate the nearest hospital. You make it about two blocks down the street before you hear a semi-familiar shout from behind you and two sets of hurried footsteps.`
			`	"There he is!" the talkative of the two from earlier shouts, "Stop him!" The other of the pair speed-walks towards you, pointing his finger at you before a point in front of you erupts into flames. You swerve to avoid the new pothole, only to find another point has erupted into flames in front of you.`
			`	"Get back here!" shouts your pursuer, flailing his arms angrily towards you.
			`	The man you're escorting to the hospital looks over and laughs. He points towards the guy, and shouts something too passionate and quick for you to catch. Within moments your pursuer drops dead with blood spurting out of several sudden bullet holes.`
			choice
				`	"What was that?"`
				`	"How did you do that?"`
			`	"He had it coming," the man you're escorting chuckles, before dropping back onto the stretcher. He continues chuckling all the way to the hospital. Once there, the man agrees to pay whatever fines crop up for treatment. After, of course, the rest of the waiting patients get taken care of. Apparently- the receptionist informs you- a bloody shirt, some cuts, and a bruise aren't lethal.`
			`	Once the two of you settle down in the waiting room, you start questioning him, "Okay, first of all, who the hell are you? Second of all, why were those men chasing you, and why did they do that to my ship? And last, but the most important question if all, how the hell do you plan on paying for all the damage you've caused to my ship's systems?"`
			`	The man looks at you as if confused, and finally says "Isn't it rude to ask someone's name before telling them your own?"`
			`	You want to jump at his throat for not taking this seriously, but manage to calm yourself, "I'm <first> <last>. Starship captain if you couldn't tell. Now, who the hell are you?" a wide smirk forms in his face, as he lets out a short laugh before responding...`
			`	"Name's Joey Jordan, I'm running away from those guys."
			choice
				`	(React well.)`
				`	(React badly.)`
				`	(React terribly.)`
			`	"That's obvious! What I want to know is if I'm aiding and abetting a criminal, taking you to the hospital! And I need my systems fixed, so tell me how you'll pay for that!"`
			`	The man frowns a bit, as if disappointed, "Honestly <last>, you shouldn't be so serious, I just put those cables of yours away so that I could hide. They're in an air vent near the cockpit, I'll just put them back there once I'm back on my feet."`
			`	He spends the rest of the time desperately trying to calm you down, "I'll fix your ship, man, don't worry! The wires and junk, they're not gone! Here, I'll call a friend to fix it up for you!" A doctor arrives to see him...`
			`	You start looking out of the windows to try and cool down, and as you look out to the building you saw Joey running out of, you see that quite a crowd has gathered there. You look at some ships docked here and notice the two men from earlier coming out of one of them, much like how they left your own ship it seems. You then start thinking about how a certain Shuttle and Freighter have been here for a while, even though you saw cargo being loaded up in them and the crew apparently being there.`
			`	As you start looking at the local news you then find something unbelievable: the spaceport authorities have prohibited any ship from departing until they find "a certain suspicious individual, suspected to have been involved in the explosions."`
			`	You ask the staff to see the man, but apparently he's already gone. You sigh and run out of the hospital, searching quickly for your ship. You pass about seven other vessels before you reach yours, and run inside, closing the hatch behind you. A choice presents itself to you; you could either check the `
			choice
				`	(Search the bunks.)`
				`	(Move to check the bridge.)`
					goto bridge
			`	You make your way to the living quarters of your ship and begin searching. You spend perhaps way too long searching through the bunks to see if he's taken refuge in your ship again. And then it dawns on you: he was hidden plenty well enough the first time around to reasonably avoid your scrutiny either way.`
			label bridge
			`	You move on to the bridge and find him simply wandering around near the front of your ship. "What are you doing in here again?" you ask, incredulous towards his carefree attitude. He replies simply, "I'll go fix that minor inconvenience your ship has," speaking as if he's a mechanic going to fix some damage you did, instead of making up for making your ship useless.`

			label last
			`	At the cockpit, he starts grabbing the cables much like you did, and you roll your eyes as you start thinking about how much this is gonna cost you, and of all the time you've lost, but when you turn back and look, he's somehow gotten all the cables inside the panel.`
			`	"Well, even so there's no way he can properly reattach all of those," you reason, but then he appears to properly affix all the wires to their places, and fit all the components in place. He removes his arms from the panel and closes it, and with the press of a button your ship's controls light up, and he turns to you with a wide grin on his face.`
			`	"See? I told you I would fix it. Now all is right in the world, right captain?" You once again think about how you haven't gone to the bar yet so you can't possibly have imagined the miracle these repairs were, but you manage to suppress your amazement, and start pressuring him again.`
			`	"All is well with my ship, but you still haven't told me why those men were after you. The news said that the spaceport is looking for a suspect, and I think I know who that suspect is."`
			`	His expression shifts from the previous happy-go-lucky to a very serious tone, as he takes a worried gaze, "Looking for a suspect you say? So I guess they've made sure to prohibit ships from leaving the docks."`
			`	He sits down and brings a hand to his chin before continuing, "Captain, it's complicated to explain everything right now, but this I can assure you: I am no criminal, rather, I am running away from some, some that happen to have a lot of power."`
			`	"So what, a local gang is after your head?" you ask, not convinced of his explanation, "No matter how strong some gangster or mafioso is here, there's no way they could stop the entire spaceport and even get all the news to talk about this event in their favor."`
			`	He stands up, "Captain, this isn't some local gang we're talking about, these guys are much more powerful, they run a scheme so big it has multiple systems on their pocket, they can make stuff like this happen with a snap of their fingers!`
			`	"Closing down dock access, stopping ships from leaving, it's all within their reach. If I'm being hunted down out there I'll need your help, Captain." He is quite agitated, and surprises you with how desperate he looks to gain your help.`
			choice
				`	"What do you need from me?"`
					goto help
				`	"I'm sorry, I don't want to get tangled up in some Mafia's business."`
			`	His face darkens, "I'm sorry, captain, but you don't really have a choice. I need to get the hell out of here, and I need you to get me there." He points his finger at you like it's about to turn into a gun and shoot you.`
			`	You stare at him incredulously. He turns around to look at something behind him, then back to you, "Oh, you're not...?" Your continued stare of incredulity seems to assure him of something. "Right, okay. So everything over the past few hours have been really bizarre, right?"`
			`	You... suppose so. "Yes, it's been really odd, and I'm wondering if I actually did skip the spaceport bar."`
			`	"You did, trust me. I just need to get off of this rock, captain <last>. Not more than a dozen jumps, really, out to <destination>.`
				goto end
			label help
			`	"I just need to get off this rock, captain <last>. Down to <destination>, not really more than a dozen jumps out," he explains.`
			label end
			`	"Alright, that shouldn't be too hard, nor too far out of the way," you reason to yourself, sitting down in the captain's chair and making preparations. In addition, you wonder if saying no is a viable option at this point...`
			`	"You're going to run into resistance trying to leave, Captain," Joey warns, pointing out the cockpit to a few ships littered about the spaceport, about as ready to depart as you are. It looks like there's going to be a fight as soon as you lift off, as well. How convenient.`

			`The man you've been escorting steps out of your ship, taking a deep breath of air. "You know, <first>, I think I can take it from here. This'll probably be the last you'll see of me. Goodbye and all that."`
			`	Before you can properly react, he flicks a credit chip your way, "And here's for all the trouble. I'm sure the Speedwagon Foundation wouldn't mind a little dent in their funds."`
			choice
				`	"What's the Speedwagon Foundation?"`
					goto speedwagon
				`	"Why the sudden charity?"`

In fact, he seems to have blended into the crowds already. At least you got paid for your troubles, though. Perhaps there's something worthwhile on that credit chip?`
			`	Back on your ship, you look down at the credit chip for a moment, and frown. It's worth a measly twenty credits. You figured Joey meant at least 1000, given the way he said "dent in their funds," but it seems the emphasis was on "little."`
