	description "Nothing is known about the origins of the ancient ship, except a single panel bearing an alien script that almost appears to read ACP."

	description "Nothing is known about the origins of the ancient ship, except a single panel bearing an alien script that almost appears to read "ACP."
	description "Due to defects in its production, the Monolith had an almost 20% decrease in its hull integrity, and a similar decrease to its crew and cargo capacity."
