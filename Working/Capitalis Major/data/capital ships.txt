	description "The Monolith, the culmination of nearly a century of tireless research and construction.

	description "Nothing is known about the origins of the ancient ship, except a single panel bearing an alien script that almost appears to read "ACP."

	description "Due to defects in its production, the Monolith had an almost 20% decrease in its hull integrity, and a similar decrease to its crew and cargo capacity."

	description "An absolute behemoth in terms of size. It is the pinicle of what Southbound Shipyards can produce. While it lacks advanced shield emmiters, it's sheer mass in armour makes it a veritable tank."

	description "Nothing in korath space can compare to the behemoth that is the 927, more a moving factory than a warship. While it's factories were damaged beyond repair in the fighting to claim this vessel, the sheer armament and power it has makes it a worthy capital all on its own."
