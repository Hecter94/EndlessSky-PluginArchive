conversation "crazy uncle"
		`You grew up on New Boston, a world in the Dirt Belt. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your crazy uncle first let you wander the bone yard he ran near the spaceport. He told you stories about flying around the galaxy, trading in strange places and fighting pirates. Your parents told you that no one really knew whaat he got up to when he ran away from home, but that no one really believed his tall tales.`
		`	After many long years of working at a textile mill during the day and studying during the night, you've finally saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic.`
		`	You wake up a bit worse for wear after the celebration to your uncle leaning on your door bell. He drags you out the door for breakfast and then takes you to a locked hanager at the back of his yard. He sldes open the door and you see a ship like nothing you've seen before. You look at your uncle but he refuses to tell you anything about it other than that it's yours.`
		`	You fly it to the spaceport proper and transfer the title and take out a mortgage against the ship to get some operating cash. What seemed like a dream just yesterday is now a reality, you just have to sign your name:`
		name
		`	Your uncle takes a photo of you holding your license in front of the ship. You can feel his emotion as he hugs you before taking surface transport back to his business. He leaves you exicted and wondering what to do next.`
