	description "A modern heavy mining ship designed to work in tandem with Mining Drones. Being more of a mobile base than a conventional mining ship, standard equipment includes a long-range asteroid scanning suite and Tractor Beams fitted to each cargo bay. Not a common sight due to its unwieldiness; it is most typically found working dense fields."
