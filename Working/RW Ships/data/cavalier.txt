	description "A heavy gunboat bristling with an absurd number of weapons for its size, and sporting enough armor to close with ships larger than itself and quite possibly survive the encounter. This armor does somewhat limit its heat dissipation and therefore its ability to fire its full weapon capacity for long, so it is most often used as a bomber. Due to its combination of long range, ruggedness and firepower, it is also well-suited for escort and patrol duties."
