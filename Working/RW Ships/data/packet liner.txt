	description "A combination transport with both passenger and cargo sections. Historically such a configuration has not been preferred as it is less efficient to manage than a ship dedicated to either carrying type, but the concept has seen a resurgence thanks to the increase of piracy in recent decades and the ensuing trend toward more sporadic shorter-distance travel."
	description "	Like the Tarazed Blackbird, it has seen some unexpected popularity as a high-speed Light Warship."
