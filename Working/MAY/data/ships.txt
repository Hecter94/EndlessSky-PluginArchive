	description "Hounds are fairly fast fighters with multiple fore facing weapons. They suffer from high energy consumption when using a full armament though, and their weight makes them a bit less responsive than other fighter options. They are also notable for being MAY's only vessel to not use their modular systems, as their role does not need the same flexibility as other MAY ships."

	description "The Kahuna is the oldest MAY hull still being produced. Original built as a mobile refinery and mining station option, it was very easy to refit into an effective carrier solution. They are fairly slow, and bulky, but they rarely need to directly engage enemies when carrying a full fighter compliment."

	description "The (M)odular (A)ssembly (C)ruiser is MAY's frontline heavy warship. It carries a considerable number of forward-facing weapons and turrets, while the modular design provides it with a high amount of durability. Most captains consider the fact that 2 of the gun ports are located so far from the front to be a bit of a drawback though."

	description "The Tempest class warship by MAY might be the best example of the short-comings in their modular designs. The ship is much heavier compared to others of the same category, causing a significant decrease in manueverability. This makes it harder to put the tempest's fore guns on a target, but any captain who can manage to do so will find the Tempest can hold its' own as a Mid-sized warship."
