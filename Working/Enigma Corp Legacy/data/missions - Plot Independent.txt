			`As you are walking through the spaceport, you notice people crowding around windows. You find the nearest available window and notice a large structure located just outside the spaceport that dwarfs the many skyscrapers around it. It appears to be incomplete, and there is a cable of some sorts jutting out the top of the building into space for what seems like forever. Judging by its size, this is no small feat of engineering.`
			`	You continue to marvel the size of the structure when a man in a Navy uniform walks up next to you. "Magnificent, isn't it?" He asks.`
			choice
				`	"Yes, indeed."`
				`	"What is it?"`
				
			`	"It's a space elevator. The first of its kind in centuries. Ever since the last great space elevator in 2235 fell, there haven't been any since, but Parliament thought that it would be needed in times like these."`
			choice
				`	"What do you mean by 'times like these?'"`
					goto times
				`	"When do you believe it will be finished?"`
			
			`	"It should be completed in about a month or two, depending on if we finally get the last of the materials. There has been a sharp increase in piracy around Sol as of late, likely just a bunch of junkies trying to take advantage of the confusion of the whole Free Worlds situation."`
				
			label times
			`	"Earth, along with many other planets, has been overpopulated for years. The only reason it hasn't fallen apart is because of the many planets in the south providing the planet with food. The situation with these new 'Free Worlds' seceding from the Republic, along with the bombings at Geminus and Martini, was a wake-up call for Parliament. Earth is a big target, so a single bombing could take out millions to even billions, as well as the fact that if these new Free Worlds go as far as to cut off our food supply here on Earth, there would be mass starvation."`
			`	"That isn't even mentioning the rapidly deteriorating environment. I'm surprised the air is even still breathable with all these decades of punishment from emissions of all sorts. It's just overall better to try and get people off the planet."`
			choice
				`	"Why don't you just use transport ships to get people off the planet instead of building such a massive structure?"`
				`	"This is scary stuff. Is there any way I can help?"`
					goto help
				`	"That's rather interesting. I'd help, but I have places to be. I wish you good luck in building it."`
					goto leave

			`	"That was the original plan, but after further calculations were done it was deemed too inefficient. There were a number of problems with it, such as the size of the current spaceport being unable to accomodate a sufficient number of transport ships to make any real progress, and if we did decide to use the spaceport then there would be no place for haulers to land and drop off the food that is keeping everyone alive. In the end, it was decided that taking up a small amount of space on the ground to connect the planet to a large spaceport in the sky would yield greater results than anything else that could be done."`
			choice
				`	"This is scary stuff. Is there any way I can help?"`
					goto help
				`	"That's rather interesting. I'd help, but I have places to be. I wish you good luck in building it."`
			
			label leave
			`	"Thank you. Have a nice day."`
				decline
				
			label help
			`	"There is something you could do. We are currently in need of some additional helping hands to escort a convoy of cargo ships to <destination> and back to pick up the last of the materials: super-strong graphine nanotubes that will be used to strengthen the main tether and support the building on the ground. This spike in pirate activity has spread us thin, meaning you will have to be able to defend that convoy on your own, and that may be difficult. And if you were to help, there are a few scientists that I need transported here as well, so you'll need enough extra passenger space for about five people."`
			choice
				`	"Sounds like something I can handle. I'll get right to it, sir."`
					goto end
				`	"Sorry, but I'm in no position to be fighting any pirates."` 

			`	"That's too bad to hear. Well, have a nice day."`
				decline

			label end
			`	"Thanks!" He says, "By the way, I'm admrial Michel Farford."`
			`	"<first> <last>," you say. You shake hands and say your goodbyes as you make your way to your ship.`
