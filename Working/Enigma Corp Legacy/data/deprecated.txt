	"unplunderable" 1
	description "A plasma rifle is the direct upgrade to a laser rifle, providing both more offensive and defensive power to your crew. Instead of firing a beam of high-powered light, a plasma rifle fires a small burst of plasma. This burst, although traveling at slower speeds, has much more stopping power compared to that of a laser and without the proper protective material can leave severe burns on the target."

	description "The heavy water cooler is essentially the same thing as a normal water cooling system, but instead filled with heavy water. Heavy water is similar to normal water, except that it contains dueterium instead of normal hydrogen connected to the oxygen atom, which increases the density of the water, making it possible to have more water in the same area. This means that a cooling system using heavy water can cool more with the same density of water."
