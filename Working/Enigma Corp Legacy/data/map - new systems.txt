	description `Akinagol's surface is a place of nightmares. Scattered across the planet are the empty husks of Quarg warships and what can only be assumed to be Quarg skeletons. Large craters pepper the surface, most three times larger than the craters on the neighboring Forsaken planet, and some being so large that they have pierced the crust of the planet to reveal the mantle below. The atmosphere is poisonous to breathe from the amount of sulfuric gases, and the rains eat away at any organic material unlucky enough not to be under cover. Some small animals and plants have managed to survive whatever hell this planet went through, but they are few and far between with most looking as though they are on Death's doorstep.`

	description `Amazonite Station is the most distant fueling station from the main Outer Rim Mining worlds, located in a system already mostly devoid of asteroids. Mining fleets rarely come here, usually only arriving if they do not have enough fuel remaining to make it to Emerald Station closer to ORM territory. On rare occasions the station is visited by fuel tankers to top off the station's fuel pods and to restock the food supplies, but otherwise ORM pays little attention to this station.`
	spaceport `Due to the relative uselessness of this station, the inside is rather unkempt. The floors are dusty and there are stains of long-past spilled liquids. The spaceport is empty except for five dirty looking individuals playing cards at one of the tables and ordering beers from whatever unlucky fellow is manning the space-bar at that moment.`

Orbiting the station there is no clear way in, but the station appears to still have a slight amount of power running the emergency lights. It gives the station an eerie atmosphere, but odds are that they will not be functional for much longer.`

	spaceport `As with The Hub, almost all landing pads are taken by freighters entering and exiting the spaceport. Given the size of the station, there are a lot less landing pads, so you wonder how they keep up with all the ships without clogging up traffic. Just then, a floating drone flies over to your ship and refuels it before you even land, then flies off to refuel more ships.`

	description `Emerald Station is the most used and well kept of all the Outer Rim refueling depot. It is the closest to the main Outer Rim Mining planets, and as such is visited by every ship returning to The Hub or leaving for a long journey north. The refueling ports are normally always occupied with ships only giving room for the refueling tankers that arrive often to fill the pods back up to full.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located opposite the refueling stations, making it one of the quietest parts of the station. Few ships bother to land here, usually only stopping at the station to take a break from the constant hyperdrive or to grab something to eat that isn't the normal grub taken on space flights.`

The surface is not littered with craters or old and forgotten warships, and the local life seems to be thriving rather well. From time to time while scanning the surface you are able to spot through the plant growth what look like buildings that are made out of the same material used in Quarg ships, suggesting that the Quarg once inhabited this planet. Despite this, no Quarg or Quarg ships can be found anywhere. It is likely that the Quarg evacuated this planet before the battle reached it, saving the planet and its native inhabitants.`

Around where you landed are a number of scattered bones from long dead animals (some of which seem to be decaying away somehow) and you notice on your ship scanner that the radiation levels are dangerously high; higher than anywhere else in this section of space. Out in the distance is the skyline of a vast advanced looking city that appears to be surrounded in a dome of sorts, but to take time explore it would likely be death due to the radiation.`

The purpose for the domes is not made clear by simply looking at them, possibly they are used as a biosphere of sorts to increase food production, but not all of the fields have them. In some areas of the planet, Forsaken are hastily building more domes and carrying building materials to the construction sites.`

The planet is mainly cities, but there are a few more suburban looking areas, and unlike the capital where every inch of the surface is covered by buildings, oceans and mountains are visible. The only notable difference on this planet is the size of the buildings; they appear to reach many kilometers in height, some dwarfing even nearby mountains. Each building must be able to hold thousands of people at the very least, making it not all that unlikely that this planet has a higher population than even the capital.`
	spaceport `The Forpup Unu spaceport seems relatively normal compared to other Forsaken space ports, aside from one fact; almost all of the Forsaken appear to be wearing some sort of breathing apparatus or gas mask. Outside of the spaceport off in the distance can be seen a large construct being build. It looks as though it is a wall similar to those on Forsaken military planets, but whatever it is being made out of is clear.`

The strange radiation that is detectable in orbit is still present on the surface of the planets albeit at a lower amount.`

Inside some of the more intact buildings are large alien warships or pieces of weaponry, making this possibly an old military planet.`
	description `	Upon inspecting some of the alien technology closer, you are unable to find any ways to use it. There are no visible inputs or outputs to any of the outfits and the ships do not even appear to have cockpits to them. You can't help but notice that a few of the outfits and ships are very Quarg-like in nature, but it is no guarantee that they are from the Quarg themselves.`

Large vehicles move crates from the shipments brought by freighters into the warehouses, and newly arrived ships are wheeled into the hangars. It is almost as if this planet is meant to be some sort of resupplying center or a secondary base of operations, supporting whatever war may be going on on the front lines.`

Even so, the orbit of the moon means that it is only within the habitable zone of the star for half of it's orbit, so for a few weeks it is reasonably livable, but the next few weeks are extrememly cold.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located inside of a volcano. The only way you were able to find it was because of the large beacon shooting out of the middle of the crater.
