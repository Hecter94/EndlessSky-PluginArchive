	description "The Sentry Drone is little more than a joke among those in the Corporation design team. Nothing more than a huge metal box filled with targetting computer and a single turret hardpoint placed on the top, the Sentry is a rarely seen drone that can be very useful in numbers, but due to its large mass and low engine capacity it is a rather easy target to hit and does not last long in large battles."

	description `The Badger was the first of the Corporation's ships that did not use a stolen design. Created to compete against the Republic Navy Combat Drone, it is the strongest drone currently on the galactic market. Equipped with three gun hardpoints and double the hull strength, the Badger can pack a huge punch. Although, some critique the Badger for being very slow and large, making it an easy target.`

	description `The Enigma Corproation's "Missile Series" of ships was the first to gain reasonable public acclaim, mainly from those who enjoy using missiles over laser or blaster weaponry. The Viper was the first in this series to be released to the public. Similar to the rest of the ships in the Missile Series, it greatly emphasizes shields over hull compared to normal human ships and is designed to have a very low drag compared to ships of the same size. It has also been praised by many for its niche design of using Lovelace Labs' new Missile Turrets and having a built in missile storage system for carrying even more missiles.`

A mix between a medium and heavy warship, it is in a rather odd place. On one had it is the size of a medium warship, but on the other it has enough weapons to compete against many heavy warships. But some tend to shy away from this beast, as all that extra weapon space come as the cost of sustantially less engine capacity.`

Although, this makes the Orca come at a heavy cost of over 43 million credits for the hull alone, as well as making the Orca a large and slow target that can have trouble defending itself."
