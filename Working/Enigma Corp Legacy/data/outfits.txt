The kinetic force of the slug landing on a target causes a massive explosion, dealing large amounts of damage and knocking back the ship that it hits. Due to the size of the slugs and the power at which the projectile is launched, they are slowly loaded into the barrel of the weapon and time must be taken for the cannon to charge, leading to rather long reload periods."
