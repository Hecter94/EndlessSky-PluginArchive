# Costly Drives
I've always found it odd that hyperdrives, despite the supposed mystery of their workings, is sold super cheaply, especially when compared to a bunch of power outfits (which have basis in real life). This plugin makes drives much more expensive, while making them unplunderable to prevent easy(er) boarding. Additionally, drive sales are much more restricted.

Known Problems:
- Broken JDs don't have increased value/unplunderable: The main use of Broken JDs is for the Remnant Broken JD mission, and I didn't want to force players to have a boarding ship to do those missions.
- Missions don't give a corresponding amount of increased money. Because of the inability to modify existing missions using plugins, this is unfixable at the moment.
