	description `Affalan is deserted. Enormous, bloated purple clouds roll across the landscape. Strange, mutated creatures roam the barren moors, and horrors lurk within the depths of Affalan's black seas.`
	description `	This eerie atmosphere is the result of extreme amounts of nuclear and biological weapons testing. When XSZ first began developing its nuclear arsenal, they needed somewhere to test, somewhere with a relatively normal ecosystem which was fairly uninhabited. Affalan was chosen, and a century later, the environment is so irradiated that you dare not step outside your ship without an extremely heavy radiation suit.`

	description `This planet is the home of the Enclave's largest ship manufacturing centres, much like Geminus in the Republic. While it is a relatively old world, the crust is composed mostly of very heavy metals and rocks, and so handily, the lighter metals which are useful for shipbuilding are found very near to the surface.`
	description `	Much of the land on Alleshafen, however, is relatively infertile, and as it seems that many types of life beyond basic plants have never developed, clothing, plastics and food are at a premium here.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Alleshafen is very heavily guarded; you and your crew were ID'd when you landed, and there are enormous embankments in areas, presumably restricting access to the planet's shipyards. These embankments are watched all the time by groups of Enclave soldiers; they stand silhouetted against the evening sky, and while you are used to people holding weaponry by now, the sight of their very, very large guns still makes you a bit nervous.`

	spaceport `This spaceport is armed to the teeth- ground-to-orbit weaponry is stationed around the main hub and landing pads, and the area is covered in mountains which you suspect contain a number of secret hangars, judging by the number of Enclave ships wheeling above on the atmosphere's edge.`
	spaceport ` When you first arrived here, you noticed the spaceport staff- as well as members of the public- looking at your ship oddly. While some appear to be considering coming over to you and asking where you found it, the vast majority of them do not.`

While little of the planet has been explored thus far, it appears to have a unique ecosystem whereby life has evolved from silicon-based compounds, instead of carbon-based compounds like humans. As a result, you and other non-scientists are restricted to the spaceport village.`
	spaceport `The spaceport and the surrounding town is enclosed by a glass dome, presumably to prevent waste gases from leaking out into the otherwise breathable atmosphere. While this is somewhat of an inconvenience, the inhabitants are nothing but hospitable, and despite this planet's status as a scientific outpost, it feels very much as though this is a true community.`

This time, however, this moon was named "Bilbo" due to its odd similarity to the far eastern areas of Middle-Earth, to which the moon's namesake travelled during The Lord of the Rings' prequel. As a result, much of the terrain is tough and mountainous- perfectly suited to the dwarves of fantasy legend.`

There are large areas of forest, but most of them seem to be artificial; you assume that true primeval woodland has long been cleared to make way for crops, in addition to the fact that you think you can see some significant ruins among the trees.`
	description `	The few major cities here seem to be little more than enormous processing plants for the food produced here, with most of the population employed there.`
	spaceport `The spaceport, instead of having been designed purely to facilitate the transportation of food, appears to have been simply converted from an enormously devoted military complex, to the transportation centre which it is now.`

	description `	Pollution is a growing problem on Carmine; while it was originally perfect for human habitation worldwide, five hundred years of human occupation and industrialisation are beginning to increase global temperatures. As a result, many equatorial areas are growing more arid every year, and bleaching events on the planet's legendary coral reefs are becoming more and more common.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is remarkably ordered; everything seems to be sweeping glass and steel, with suited businesspeople everywhere looking really grumpy with everything.`

	description `	 As expected, the station is equipped with enormously strong shields; even the slightest hull breach could send the station tumbling off into the rings, knocking asteroids down onto the planet as it went.`
	spaceport `As you stepped off of your ship, the guards forced you to wear a small metal band around your wrist. Apparently, this band is designed to give the wearer an electric shock hard enough to knock them out, in order to prevent anyone from messing with the station's guidance or control systems without permission.`
	spaceport `	The rest of the spaceport is occupied by drones being serviced; presumably, these are what are used to shove asteroids around in the rings.`

planet Crackle
	attributes xsz
	landscape land/nasa2
	description `Crackle is one of XSZ's main manufacturing and mining worlds, thanks to the frequent impacts from objects falling out of the planetary rings above. While these impacts often throw up clouds of dust which may obscure the system's star for days or even weeks at a time, they both bring new material to the planet for mining and dig out large craters, allowing XSZ to find elements usually found deep within the crust relatively easily.`
	description `	Most of the factories are situated well away from where the rings currently orbit; as the ring orbit moves north or south, the industrial centres move with it. They are designed to be able to be disassembled in mere weeks.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is filled with people; some poor and destitute, practically begging for a job here; some battle-hardened, the veterans of this mining world; and some families, seemingly carrying everything they own, waiting around to find a way of getting off this rock.`

	description `	Much of the surface is formed of ragged peaks and crags- presumably, this is as a result of the massive gravitational forces acting on the planet, yet which are unable to fully pull the planet into the black hole.`
	spaceport `Cromerium's spaceport is a series of very tall buildings. They appear to be sculpted out of a single piece of metal, without impurities, although you know that that is impossible. Landing bays for ships are on the sides of the buildings, fully automated- a ship can land, be refueled, repaired, and recharged without a single spaceport worker needing to enter the hangar.`
	spaceport `	Oddly enough, there are no massive arrays of merchants here hawking their wares- it appears that all businesses are owned by the central Ascendancy government, and as a result, the trading areas are oddly calm.`

	spaceport `The main spaceport complex on Cynic is a flat, stumpy set of buildings towards the coast of Cynic's largest ocean. The whole thing is surrounded by a barricade of concrete walls, razor wire, and presumably mines, and the walls are almost ten yards thick- doubtlessly to protect the spaceport against the frequent political protests that occur on this planet.`

What's more, despite this system's relative proximity to Lyfon, the Enclave's capital, it is in fact well over two weeks' hyperspace travel away, making this one of the most remote and under-represented systems in the galaxy.`

	description `	According to broadcasts you received from the local government as you were coming in to land, inhabitants of Forefather are the happiest, on average, of any planet ruled by the Ascendancy. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is full of old takeoff gantries, like the ones that were used in the very first years of the space age to launch humanity's primitive rockets.

	description `	While most of the population here consists of farmers, taking care of and managing the countryside and living in rustic homes, a surprisingly large percentage of inhabitants find this world as dull as an old, musty sock, and are scraping together all the money they can possibly find to leave this planet far behind.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is extremely flashy for a planet like this. Although it does not use sweeping, graceful curves like many other spaceports do, it still has an atmosphere of class and optimism about it, all through the white-stained granite blocks that make up most of the buildings.`

	description `Lyfon is the capital of the Enclave, named after the Enclave's first leader. While Lyfon is, admittedly, not the most hospitable of planets, the habitable regions around the equator as well as the apparently vast amounts of natural resources contained within the planet allowed it to quickly develop into the safest planet in Enclave space.`
	description ` Lyfon's system, Five, is named as such due to its astonishing five hospitable planets.`
	spaceport `The spaceport in Lyfon's capital city is situated a few miles out from the city centre, surrounded by massive areas of savannah. As you sit in the spaceport bar, you wonder what it must be like to grow up in the city, watching the bright flashes of ships taking off into the night.`

	description `Magna is a desolate planet, having been continually strip mined by XSZ for the past two centuries. However, there are a reasonable number of settlements here. The reason why? XSZ's largest shipyards are located here, meaning thousands of people migrate here each year to fill the massive number of jobs required to work in the shipyards, as well as the mines.`
	description `	Surprisingly enough, the relative background radiation levels here are abnormally low; despite XSZ's normal record of bad radiation safety, it appears that everything here is at least half lead, doubtless to prevent any possibility of workers being discouraged from coming to work here due to dangerous conditions.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an enormous complex, taking advantage of the massive space afforded by being in an area that has already been exhausted of its raw materials.`
	spaceport `	A good third of the spaceport is filled by recruiting offices for various divisions of XSZ- XSZ Shipyards, XSZ Steel, XSZ Systems- and more. As a result, there are equally long lines of people, many of whom look desperate, queuing out of these offices in an attempt to secure a job for themselves.`

planet Mein

	landscape land/snow11-sfiera
	description `Mein is an icy world of blizzards and fog, where very few organisms can thrive. Despite this, a surprisingly large number of enterprising colonists set up a few towns a number of centuries ago, and they are still struggling on through the endless snow.`
	description `	Mein is in the process of being accelerated towards its star through a gravitational slingshot effect provided by one of its planetary neighbours. This is slowly beginning to warm the planet's climate, although it may still take hundreds of years for Mein to be truly habitable.`
	spaceport `Your ship landed in the midst of a snowstorm, and you could hardly see where you were going as you ran inside with your crew. There appear to be very few people in this spaceport, little more than a skeleton staff, and while you know that you are safe inside from the ferocious winds, you cannot help but look around nervously whenever you hear the steel frame of the spaceport creak.`

planet Memorandum
	attributes enclave notjumblar
	landscape land/city2
	description `Memorandum is a very "normal" world. The climate is stable and fairly warm, days are similar to those on Earth, and many of the inhabitants work in simple, boring office jobs which pay decently but are ultimately unexciting. The population is relatively low, too, although oddly enough, most families are in a very similar wealth band; poverty is mostly unheard of, and yet wild amounts of wealth is too.`
	description `	Very few people you meet have high aspirations for leaving the planet.`
	spaceport `The port staff are surprisingly cheerful, unlike just about every other human port you have visited, in this galaxy or the next. These are clearly the few people who, like you once did, want to leave this planet far behind in their own ship to become a trader, or a bounty hunter, or a warfleet captain. Their enthusiasm inspires an odd sort of nostalgia inside you, of the innocence you left behind when you joined the Free Worlds and their war.`

	description `Mirrodin is an advanced space station designed by the XSZ Corporation. Encompassing much of the Skryydr system, Mirrodin is somewhat like a Quarg ringworld, albeit that it is constructed with proportions more suited to your human psyche. Mirrodin, like an onion, consists of layers; the spaceports are situated on the outer edge of the ring, followed by the outfitters and shipyards, then the commercial band, and then the residential sector, facing the star in the centre of the system.`
	description `	This station was built as a show of competition with the Enclave; building the most advanced station thus far constructed by humans is no mean feat, and placing it on the Enclave's doorstep, you suspect, was an intentional move in XSZ's cold war against the Enclave, not unlike that between the Deep and the Paradise Worlds in the Milky Way a few decades after the Alpha Wars.`
	spaceport `As you disembark from your ship, a number of advertisments boom through the hangar- "Welcome to Mirrodin! Now the most advanced entertainment and leisure centre in the galaxy!" "Over 100 kilometres of non-stop laser tag action, all for the low price of just 500 credits per person! Terms and conditions apply!" `
	spaceport ` The spaceport section of the space station is surprisingly clean and well-kept, unlike many you have seen in the Republic or the Free Worlds- most likely because this is the area receiving the station's residents, as well as those visiting simply for the enormous laser tag facilities.`

	description `New Asgard is a relatively small moon, although despite this it is still able to hold onto a thick, breathable atmosphere. Much of the moon is desert, although some areas near the highest mountains do receive enough rain to allow them to become well-forested. The oceans here have enormous tide differences due to the gas giant above, and as a result, most seaside settlements are practically built inside glass domes reinforced with titanium so that they can survive the inrush of water at high tide.`
	description `	Despite the relative absence of natural resources, New Asgard is still fairly rich due to the tourism industry- many people come here simply to experience the awe of waking up to see the face of a gas giant staring down at them.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a slick, clean and modern, with hallways paved in dark granite and arching roofs overhead. Most of the terminal is taken up by small stores and off-licenses.`
	spaceport `	The entire spaceport seems to be filled with people with cameras, hysterically barging their way through the crowds to find their ride off of this moon.`

planet "New Scotland"
	attributes enclave notjumblar
	landscape land/desert8-sfiera
	description `New Scotland is a world consisting of scrubland and low mountain ranges, for the most part; it is an old world, where tectonic activity is beginning to die down. As a result of the decrease in tectonic activity, the planet's magnetoshpere is also slowly weakening. This in turn increases the amount of radiation falling on the surface, making the inhabitants much more likely to develop cancerous growths as they age.`
	description `	Most families live on isolated farms in the foothills; it would be even harder to get supplies to them if they were in the mountains proper, and the deep wastes are rumoured to contain dreadful horrors of the sands.`
	spaceport `As you stepped off your ship, the air already had a noticeably dry tang to it. The spaceport is situated in a large patch of desert, although the mountains nearby alter the weather enough to provide this area with some rain, at least. The architecture feels somewhat ramshackle, not unlike the frontier towns of the 17th century back on Earth; the roads are simply dusty trails, and the majority of buildings are constructed from wood.`
	spaceport `	Despite this, the security guards near the trading areas have some very advanced-looking guns.`

planet Oro'alein'platrez
	attributes kaltheim
	landscape land/sea0
	description `Oro'alein'platrez is cold and gloomy, somewhat typical of Kaltheim worlds. Most of the land is flat and low-lying, and while the massive life readings coming from the oceans indicate that fishing here would be a successful commercial enterprise, there seem to be only a few seaborne vessels. A lot of the areas above sea level appear to have been given to farming; the fact that the vast majority of the planet's landscape is divided into perfectly square fields seems to indicate that this planet is the breadbasket of the Kaltheim's civilisation, despite the low levels of sunlight that reach the planet's surface.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a regimented mass of sullen, blocky buildings. It appears that most of the infrastructure here has been designed solely for the purpose of shifting food from the farms, to the spaceport, and off the planet in order to feed the rest of the Kaltheim race.`

planet Ortite
	attributes enclave notjumblar
	landscape land/desert1
	description `This is a somewhat deprived world, consisting of deserts for the most part, albeit with a few tropical regions around the poles. Most of the population is employed in hard labour, gathering sand from the deserts for extravagant artificial beaches on richer worlds or manufacturing basic farming equipment for other worlds. There is also a thriving petrochemicals industry here, based on extracting oil from beneath the expansive, more low-lying deserts.`
	description `	As there is very little liquid water here, the few settlers who have not been forced into the industrialised drudgery that most have have been able to develop some intriguing technology designed to collect water vapour from areas miles wide and then condense it. This water is then sold to the local government to allow some standard of running water to exist in the cities.`
	spaceport `Ortite's spaceport is a ghost town. While there are still a number of landing pads, it appears that many others have sunk into the sand and buried over time. The few people you see here are clearly off-worlders; their clothing is nothing like the dull, forgettable brown outfits that the inhabitants wear.`

	description `	XSZ-funded surveys have found that there are enormous oil and gas fields beneath the oceans of Perihelion. Despite XSZ's numerous appeals to the Enclave government to allow them to mine the fuels here, the Enclave has refused, every time.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is located right on one of the coasts, nearest to the equator. As you stepped off of your ship, a small gaggle of tourists walked past, evidently unaware of the state of relations currently between the Enclave and XSZ, or even the likelihood that this would be one of the first worlds XSZ might move to take in the event of war.`

Strange structures rise far above the treetops, their organic-looking architecture mirroring the design of the Pug ships that you have seen.`
	description `	There is an unfathomable sense of calm permeating this planet and all of its Pug inhabitants.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Puggleshank lies in the centre of the city. Strangely enough, the landing pads are few and far between, nowhere near enough to accomodate the Pug ships flying through the system. You suspect that there are hangars far below the ground, although the density of buildings around the spaceport and their apparent weight would seem to suggest otherwise.`

	description `Quaver has been heavily urbanised since its settlement a little more than five centuries ago. As a world with relatively low-lying land, the risk of flooding is always a possibility, although thankfully due to the absence of many mountains, the weather is usually predictable.`
	description `	While it is one of the richest planets in the galaxy, Quaver is actually home to relatively few billion, or even millionaires, as its massive wealth comes from its status as one of the primary trading planets away from the heart of Enclave space. As a result, there is a very well-funded welfare programme for inhabitants of the planet, which includes a universal basic income, something entirely unheard of in the Republic.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here feels vibrant and alive, the flow of goods and traders constant. Nobody is standing still; everyone has somewhere to be, although it seems that in this rush their regard for other people has not diminished- as you watch, someone is knocked over in the crowd, and instead of trampling over them like people from the Paradise Worlds would, a good five people stop to help them to their feet.`

	spaceport `	The architects who designed some of the spaceport buildings themselves were obviously very fond of 19th-century British architecture; the buildings, with their arching cast-iron beams and glass roofs are very reminiscent of large train stations in the United Kingdom during that period.`

	description `Tarkir is a relatively flat, boring world. Covered in badlands and the occasional ocean or forest, not many people live here- and with good reason.`
	description `	Somehow, Tarkir is populated by creatures very similar to the dragons of Skymoot, back in Free Worlds space. These "dragons", however, are far more aggressive than those found on Skymoot, and are known to attack settlements regularly. Despite this, there is a strong cultural tradition among the locals who believe that any pilot aspiring to join the planetary militia must fight off a dragon attack on their own, shipless, before they are deemed worthy of the title.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is well defended against the dragons, with blaster turrets, missile silos, and enormous electrified metal nets erected over the main buildings. The landing pads are left to fend for themselves, however; the port authorities trust that pilots should be alert enough to be able to use the weapons on their ships to fend off the dragons.`

	description `	Termite's lightning is far, far stronger than on any other planet known to humanity, and as a result, whenever a bolt strikes, the enormous temperatures can actually fuse together hydrogen molecules found in the atmosphere to form helium. As a result, XSZ uses this planet as a massive, planet-sized fusion reactor in order to both generate large amounts of energy which can be stored and then shipped off-world, and to synthesise some rare elements via controlled fusion.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is very low to the ground, and is covered in some sort of opaque, rubbery material; any possible measures to stop lightning from hitting any part of the spaceport are in place. The winds are immense on this planet, and the air practically hums with ozone.`

	description `	Unlike other major Kaltheim garrisons, Ziv'rahk'ashgrir has a fairly large shipbuilding industry in addition to the pure military features- presumably, the on-world shipbuilding is to allow the fleets stationed here to be replenished relatively quickly without needing to transfer forces from other parts of space.`
