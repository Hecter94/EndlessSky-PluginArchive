	description "One of the Ascendancy's strangest warships, the Ravager is without a doubt one of their most powerful. Eschewing shields in favour of a ridiculously resilient hull, the Ravager's energy systems can be fully directed towards the engines and weapons systems thanks to the absence of shields."

	description "The Strike Drone is a pilotless attack ship utilised by the Ascendancy. Capable of using one miniaturised outfit, the standard model comes equipped with a laser, allowing the Strike Drone to deal surprisingly high amounts of damage, relative to its size."
	description " The Strike Drone has no shields, instead conforming to the Ascendancy tradition of relying on a ridiculously strong hull."
