			`	The process of a ceasefire being negotiated continues for an agonisingly long time, until eventually, the diplomats seem to have arrived at a deal: a two-week ceasefire to allow both sides to move their civilians out of harm's way. While you suspect that XSZ did not agree to this out of regard for human life- more in order to conserve their workforce- it is undoubtedly good.`

Now all that remains is a desolate wasteland of flattened buildings and millions of dead people- or not even that. In what appears to have been a nuclear blast, the majority of the city's population has been vaporized.`
			`	"After launching this first atrocious nuclear assault on a civilian population, we are getting reports that the perpetrators are the XSZ Corporation," the newsreader says with a slight tone of hysteria in his voice. "And that this atrocity has been repeated on a number of other large settlements across Carmine. We were unable to contact the President, nor any military leaders for their take on this attack."`

			`	"Since the vast majority of our forces are on this side of XSZ," Druff continues, "We likely won't be able to launch an attack to retake Carmine and Alleshafen, so our current plan is to launch an assault up through Perihelion and Fluorine, then south to Latent. If we can take out their leaders, the mercs XSZ is employing will probably fall apart within a few days. Understood?"`

As a result, as you attempt to flee the base, you are apprehended by a large group of soldiers and thrown in a basement cell to rot. In the middle of the night, someone comes in and shanks you.

			`As you step into the spaceport, you find everyone rushing about- no relaxation after a hard battle, no mourning for the dead. If anything, you think, the mood is similar to what it was like immediately before the Battle of Innenheim, months ago.`
			choice
				`	Stop someone and ask what's going on.`
			`	"What's happened?" you ask a junior officer rushing past you. "Invasion," they say, before noticing your rank. "Admiral Kuznetsov wants you. In the main departures hall." The officer then leaves, leaving you no more enlightened than you previously were.`
			choice
				`	Head to the departures hall.`
			`	"Lieutenant <last>," you hear as you step into the departures hall. Ahead of you is a small knot of officers around your own rank and above, including Cathy Bradford. The speaker appears to be a tall, grizzled Admiral- this, you presume, is Admiral Kuznetsov. "Where have you been?"`
			choice
				`	"I got distracted by all the ice cream stands."`
				`	"I stayed in orbit for a bit longer to blow up some disabled ships."`
				`	"Sorry I'm late, sir."`
			`	As Kuznetsov begins speaking again to the group of officers as a whole, you manage to stand next to Cathy, although she ignores you for a bit. "We have received intelligence that the Daia, Four, Aetrus and Gautus systems have developed new hyperspace links to an area south of our space," Kuznetsov continues. "Our few vessels which were in the systems at the time reported a large force, clearly alien, and clearly heavily armed, jumping in. As of now, we have lost contact with all systems beyond Innenheim. From what little we know of their vessels, this attack force was not Pug."`

			label hat
			`	"That may be so, Lieutenant," Kuznetsov replies, "But we need to mobilise again. We're trapped between XSZ and these aliens, so unless we want to be squashed like so many insects, we need to move back to Jumblar. XSZ is no longer a priority; we need to defend our space against these interlopers. Any questions?"`

			`	"Exactly," Kuznetsov replies. "XSZ is no longer a priority; we need to pull back to Jumblar. From there we can co-ordinate a counterstrike against these aliens. Any questions?"`

				`	"No questions."`
			`	"Dismissed," Kuznetsov says. "Lieutenants <last> and Bradford, I need to speak to you for a minute." He waits for the others to leave, then turns to the pair of you. "For your exceptional courage and continuous devotion to our cause, you have each been promoted to the rank of Commander, along with a pay raise to a salary of 900 credits per day. Congratulations."`
