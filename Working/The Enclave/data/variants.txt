ship "Lance" "Enclave Lance"
	description "The Enclave's variant on the Lance was initially developed during the war against the Ascendancy, strangely mirroring the one used by the Republic Navy. However, the Enclave is now beginning to phase the Lance out, in favour of the more agile Dart."

	
ship "Scout" "Enclave Scout"
	description "The original Scouts were first brought to the Tyridium galaxy along with the first settlers, and the design has changed very little since."
	description "	Although these Scouts are a lot more rugged and battle-worn than those found in the Milky Way, they seem to be no different in the way they are outfitted."
