	description "The Apollo is the largest and most advanced warship developed by the Enclave so far, somewhere between the Cruisers and the Carriers of the Republic in terms of size. The Apollo is able to carry two fighters in its bays, usually Darts. Despite its size, the Apollo is fairly maneuverable, capable of matching many interceptors in combat."
	description "	The Apollo was named after the series of missions during the second half of the 20th century which allowed humanity to set foot on a stellar object other than Earth for the first time."

	description "The Bloodhound is a lean, mean fighting vessel recently produced by XSZ Shipyards.

	description "The Caesennia is an incredibly odd warship- one of the most heavily armoured in Enclave space, and yet it is also one of the fastest. (And most power hungry.)"
	description "	The Caesennia was developed during the Enclave Civil War as a response to XSZ's alarming new nuclear arsenal- through some very clandestine contacts, the designers were able to get hold of some incredibly interesting metal which was used to plate the hull, resulting in the Caesennia's abnormally high hull strength."

What's more, it also has reasonably strong shields, allowing it to weather an attack if it can't outrun a hostile."

	description "The Leatherback is a heavy freighter designed by XSZ to facilitate the growth of larger independent merchant fleets- to this end, it is equipped with strong anti-missile systems, as well as a pair of flamethrowers, unusually. It even has interference plating added, for those few captains who may be transporting slightly less legal commodities than the norm."
	description "	To offset the fuel consumption of the flamethrowers, the Leatherback comes straight off the assembly line with a pair of ramscoops already installed."
	description "	The Leatherback's name came about as a result of an XSZ executive watching an ancient, classic film from Earth, which featured enormous alien monsters invading the planet. One of these monsters was named Leatherback, and in a drunken haze, he decided to name this freighter after it."

	description "The Turbulence is a medium warship designed by XSZ to act as the primary flagships for their fleets."
	description "	As a result, although the Turbulence is available for sale to the public, it has been built with nuclear capabilities in mind, and as a result, XSZ has added a massive eight gun ports for nuclear missiles. Despite this, they do appear to have taken into consideration at least some of the needs of average ship-owners, adding two turret mounts for anti-missile systems."
	description "	The nuclear version of the Turbulence is not available to the public."
