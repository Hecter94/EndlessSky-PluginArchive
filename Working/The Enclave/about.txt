The Enclave is a story-driven plugin focused on the discovery of an isolated group of humans stranded, hundreds of years ago, in another galaxy. I'd recommend you have a large Tier 2 fleet at least to complete the (admittedly still in-progress) story.
Special thanks to Derpy Horse (https://github.com/Amazinite) for adding the animated stars.
