	description "The Scavenger is an ancient ship: developed hundreds of years ago to transport radioactive materials across human space, it had lost importance with the introduction of generalised and better armed haulers like the Bulk Freighter and the Behemoth. It came back in use as a pirate freighter after the discovery that its radiological shields and internal structure were very efficient at hiding its cargo, interfering with incoming scans enough to block almost all of them."

	description "One of the many Firebird-based designs proposed in the last centuries, the Warbird was a popular vessel that qualifies as a middle ground between medium and heavy warships. Major shipyards have stopped producing it decades ago, but some pirates keep creating them for their plundering capabilities."
