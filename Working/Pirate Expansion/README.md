# Pirate-Expansion
Expand your pirate experience with new ships, outfits, systems and even mechanics! This plugin expands the northern pirate section to a large area, big enough to allow trading or similar activities one could do in the rest of the galaxy. Two new pirate ships are added, a freighter that is by itself capable of jamming the nearby sensors and a middle ground between the Firebird and the Leviathan. Finally, 6 new outfits are added, including two turrets and one special outfit that comes with a special mechanic that is obtainable using a lot of invisible missions.
