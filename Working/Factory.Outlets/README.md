
### Factory Outlets ###

Ship price = hull + outfit prices. This simple equation has the consequence that ships can be overprized when one intends to replace most of the outfits anyway, and one would basically need only the hull.

Based on an idea of [Lifeyouristhis](https://github.com/lifeyouristhis), this plugin introduces *Factory Outlets*. Around the headquarter planets of the shipyard companies stations have been placed which sell their ships with only a minimum sets of outfits, just enough to let a ship fly. For instance, a Leviathan's standard price is 17.1 Mio credits, but at the Betelgeuse Factory Outlet station it's only 9.9 Mio.

No factory outlet for Navy or Pirate shipyards, because lore. No factory outlet ship variants for fighters and drones, because senseless.

Currently the plugins [Blended Ships](https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships), [DAIS](https://github.com/Daeridanii1/DAIS), [Lost in Midnight](https://github.com/MidnightPlugins/Lost-in-Midnight), [Louise Conglomerate Shipyards](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou/ES-plugins/blob/main/README.md#LouiseConglomerateShipyards), [Rumskib](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/rumskib), and [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) are supported.
