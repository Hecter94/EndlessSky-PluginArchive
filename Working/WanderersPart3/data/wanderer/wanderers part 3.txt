			`You meet with Rek, who has grown considerably since you first saw her, though still not as tall as before the Molt, and still shorter than you. "Greetings, captain! What do you think of our new colony?"`
			choice
				`	"It's impressive work for two groups who have no common language. With one exception."`
				`	"I was hoping it'd be a bit further along by now."`
					goto furtheralong
			`	She seems pleased. "Everyone has been working very hard. The Efreti here are genuinely interested in making connections and working with us, though there are still difficulties in communication. It is certainly slower and less precise, though we have been fortunate not to have any serious misunderstandings."`

			`	She seems a little disappointed. "Everyone has been working very hard. The Efreti here are genuinely interested in making connections and working with us, though there are still difficulties in communication. It is certainly slower and less precise, though we have been fortunate not to have any serious misunderstandings."`
			label gaps
			choice
				`	"I suppose you're filling in the gaps?"`
			`	"Indeed. To that end, I'd like to make a request of you, but first, our leaders here, both Wanderer and Korath, are going to be metting shortly and we'd like you to join us."`
			choice
				`	"Can't you tell me on the way?"`
			`	She acquiesces and explains, "The Molt has given me the ability to relatively quickly learn the Korath language, however we cannot assume it will do the same for all others. I would like to visit the man you got your speaking translator from, I'm hoping between his linguistic work, my own experiences with the Korath, and one of our artificial minds, it will be possible to deveelop a translator between the Wanderer or Hai and Korath languages."`
			`	She leads you to one of the larger buildings in the settlement, apparently akin to a town hall of sorts, inside are a number of Wanderers and Kor Efret, some standing, some sitting, arranged in a circle. The Wanderers form one half, the Korath form the other. Many of the Wanderers do not look quite right to you, but you're not sure what exactly it is. You recognise Tema'a Iriket, the terraforming specialist, but are surprised to see that Sobari Tele'ek, who has played a significant role in the Wanderers' development on this side of the Eye up until now, is not present.`
			`	A few more filter in over the next few minutes. Once everyone has arrived and settled down, you are somewhat surprised to see that one of the Korath takes the lead and starts speaking. After it is done, Rek begins speaking to the rest of the Wanderers in their own language. They all seem to respond positively and one of them speaks to the Korath, with Rek as translator. Unfortunately, not in the Hai language so your translator cannot help and Rek seems too busy, now that the discussion is developing further with someone speaking, and needing translation, almost continuously.`
			`	After several minutes, one of the Korath gestures to you while speaking, and Rek finally brings you in on the discussion, "He thanks you for your contributions to our efforts to make this territory safer, by eliminating hte threat of the war machines, and rejuvenating these worlds through your help to us and was wondering if you'd be willing to assist the Efreti more directly?"`
			choice
				`	"Of course!"`
					goto agreed
				`	"What sort of help are they interested in?"`
			`	She briefly speaks to the Wanderers, then addresses the Korath, prsumably conveying your question. Once they respond, she turns back to you, "They'd like to begin a dialog with the Mereti, and feel your moderation of such meetings would be beneficial."`
			choice
				`	"Alright, it'll be good to see how the Mereti are doing, too."`
			label agreed
			`	She conveys your response and the Korath make a sound that you assume is a cheer. After some more discussions, which you are again not involved in, one of the Wanderers begins speaking in the Hai language, you'd almost forgotten that you had your translator here, but it reliably informs you of what the Wanderer said, "When you are [free, able], leaders on the old worlds have requested your [analysis, observations] of Hai activity on the [border, boundary]."`
			choice
				`	"I can do that."`
					goto agreed2
				`	"Are the Pug not guarding your systems against the Hai?"`
			`	"They are. However, we prefer to be [independent, self-sufficient] and do not [wish, desire] to [take for granted?] the aid of the Keepers, now that we have the [capability, equipment] to defend outselves, until we are able to fully move to this new space and begin our work here in earnest." You noticed some murmuring amongst the Wanderers as he spoke, but are unable to tell which part they were reacting to.`
			`	Rek helpfully, and somewhat ominously, explains, "Not everyone agrees that we should actively fight the Hai, even if it is only to defend ourselves as we withdraw."`
			choice
				`	"Ok, I'll visit them on Vara K'Chrai."`
			label agreed2
			`	The Wanderer signals gratitude, and the discussions again move on, without you.`
			`	As the meeting appears to be ending, the Wanderers and Korath begin making their way out, in not entirely segregated groups, which is good to see. Rek begins to explain, "Apologies for not involving you more, but it would be difficult to conduct a meeting such as this in the Hai language for many of our people. These discussions require greater fluency than many have in the Hai language, additionally, more of us are nearing the Molt, which is impeding their abilities in second languages. And translating such a fast paced discussion between three different languages is difficult, even for me. You see now why I want to develop a translator."`
			`	Rek explains that you can find the Korath who wish to connect with the Mereti in the spaceport when you are ready, "They will wait a few weeks, there is still plenty of work here, but if you take too long, they may decide to find their own way to Mereti space."`
			`	"You can also meet me in the spaceport when you are ready to take me to see the Hai translator scientist. I'll need to get Meto Pa'aret to accompany us to the Mind laboratories in the old systems. Is there anything before I go?"`
			choice
				`	"I noticed Sobari Tele'ek was missing from the meeting. Is he managing the defense against the Hai?"`
			`	"As you may know, Tele'ek was nearing the Molt while we were still dealing with the Kor Sestor drones. Since their factories have been shut down, and there are no longer any immediate threats to us here, he has recently elected to stop resisting and allow the Molt to take its course. Once it is done, he will be only the second since the Eye opened."`

			`	Before you get underway, Rek says to you "Slight change of plans, it occurred to me that, perhaps, two aliens should not arrive on a Hai world, where they may not even have heard of us, unannounced and unaccompanied, so I think we should go to <destination> and collect Sayari, first." You agree.`

			`As you made your way to the planet, you note that this system is very active, with many cargo and transport ships going in all directions, the logistics of moving an entire species from one set of planets to another via a wormhole in a single system must be an incredible logistical challenge, especially when the destination systems can barely support life. This is something the Wanderers have done many times, probably more than you can count, maybe more than they can, and the patterns you start to see emerge in the movements of the ships around you show that this is a well choreographed operation. You also note a number of much smaller craft you don't recognise, interceptor sized, perhaps, travelling to the east, into the border with the Unfettered Hai, guarded by the two advanced Pug warships."`
			`	During the landing, Rek contacts Sayari and arranges a meeting with her.`
			`	When you exit the lift in the main government building, you are met almost immediately by Sayari, and she leads the three of you to her office.`
			`	Once inside, Rek explains the situation between the Wanderers and the Korath and her plan to visit Eruk and aim to develop a translator together, using the Hai language so Pa'aret can be involved, even though the rest of you can use your own language.`
			`	Sayari seems to understand where Rek is going with this, "And you would like me to [chaperone, guide, escort] you to <planet>?"`
			`	"Indeed, no Wanderer has ever [visited, been seen on] a Hai world before, I thought it [prudent, wise] that you accompany us, if possible." Rek agrees.`
			`	"I would be glad to. It has been a long time since I have [returned to, visited] Hai space, if you would be willing, I would appreciate a stop at Hai-Home on this [journey, trip]? I would also like to see these new worlds your people are [migrating?] to, and to [meet, encounter] the Korath there." Sayari agrees.`
			choice
				`	"I think we can find time for that."`
					goto end
				`	"Are you sure it's a good idea for you to visit the Korath?"`
			`	Sayari raises an eyebrow, "Why not? Would there be [ill feelings?] towards me? It is true the Korath once [raided, attacked] our space, it is a time I even remember. But it was my understanding that the Korath there now have chosen [peace, friendship]. I would not hold the actions of their kin and their ancestors against them."`
			`	Rek agrees, "The Korath who live there now are indeed [peaceful, friendly], though seeing yet another [alien race?] in their territory may concern them that the Hai may [invade, attack] them. Though, I'm sure they will understand that you are just an [ambassador] wishing to meet them once we have explained."`
			label end
			`	Sayari seems pleased by this.
			`	Before you leave, you suggest to Rek and Pa'aret that Eruk will probably be interested in learning about Wanderer history and culture, based on your previous encounter with him. Rek agrees that taking something with you would be a good idea and disappears into the government building for a while. When she returns to your ship, she has a bag with many data cards.`
			choice
				`	(Say nothing.)`
					accept
				`	"You didn't need to bring everything."`
			`	She looks quizzically at you. "Everything? These records only extend back ten Molts, even then, it is not possible to provide everything."`
			choice
				`	"Only ten?"`
					goto ten
				`	"Why is it not possible to provide everything?"`
			`	After a few seconds of though, she begins, "Sometimes, following the Eye, records are not kept will, it is often a chaotic time, and sometimes, past records are lost. This data still covers close to a million of your years."`
				goto nextquestion
			label ten
			`	"That is still close to a million of your years, <first>." She explains, with a hint of condescension.`
			label nextquestion
			choice
				`	"How long is the Wanderer history in total?"`
			`	The expression on her face is difficult to decipher, perhaps.. wistful? "It is impossible for us to know for sure. Many of the older records are long lost to us. We do know we have been through at least a hundred different regions of space, and usually spend tens of thousands of years in each."`
			`	That would make the Wanderers as a species millions of years old, far older than almost any of the other civilizations you've met.`

			`During your appraoch, Sayari contacts the local government and informs them that she is bringing some of the aliens from the north to meet a technologist and requests they minimise traffic along their reoute and provide a security escort. While waiting for them, you send a message to Eruk, saying you have brought some Wanderers who wish to meet him and discuss his translator research. He agrees quickly.`
			`	You are directed to a pad in a secluded part of the spaceport and a number of diplomatic security officers are waiting for you. Sayari greets them and makes sure they understand where you are going. To their credit, they only momentarily gawk and Rek and Pa'aret before preparing to escort you to Eruk's labs.`
			`	The journey is, fortunately, uneventful. The Wanderers, especially Rek, spend it taking in the alien environment. The route is not completely devoid of Hai civilians, but the few you pass give your group a wide berth, even if they are staring at the Wanderers for the whole time.`
