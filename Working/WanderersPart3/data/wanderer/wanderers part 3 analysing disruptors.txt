			`You find Tele'ek near a ship you do not recognise, not that this is surprising when it comes to the Wanderers anymore. It is a medium sized ship, similar to the Tempest, but much bulkier, and it seems to have a pair of fighter bays, which is a surprise.`
			`   Tele'ek spots you and ends the conversation he is engaged in before approaching you. "Captain, your thoughts?" He asks, making a wide, sweeping gesture with one wing, indicating the new ship.`
			choice
				`   "It can carry fighters? That's new for you."`
				`   "It looks strong, I look forward to flying one."`
					goto next
			`	"Indeed. The small craft that will [accompany, support] this vessel will be very well armed for their size, but leave their pilots [vulnerable, unprotected]. The designs are not yet [complete, concluded], however, so we cannot show you any today. The ship may also carry a small number of drones, allowing our Flycatchers to support ships beyond our systems.`
			label next
			`	"While this [unit, prototype] is complete, production, for now, is still slow, so it may be a while before you are able to [purchase, acquire] your own." He says, apologetically. "What I [wish, desire] today is to [assess, observe] one of the new capabilities in this generation of craft." He pauses momentarily, "The shield matrices have been improved to provide better [harmonization?] and [dissipate?] disrupting effects applied to them, such as those caused by the Mereti's weapons, faster."`
			choice
				`	"Aren't they your allies? Why do you need better defenses against their weapons?"`
				`	"That sounds very useful. I look forward to seeing this technology in action."`
					goto ends
			`	He breaths out in something akin to a sigh, "The Mereti [gestalt, intelligence] are indeed allies, but they are not the only ones who utilize disrupting weapons, and the others are less [friendly, agreeable].`
			label end
			`	"If you are willing, I'd like you to accompany us to <destination> where, with the [aid, support] of the Mereti, we may witness the new shield harmonization in practice, and assess its capabilities."`
