### quarg.farm
<br>
<br>
Adds a new system "Saquerver" (between human and coalition space) where you can farm a new Quarg faction. Also the death sentence from all other Quarg got removed.<br>
<br>
The system "Saquerver" lies between "Serquergen" and "Ablub". The usual-sized Quarg fleets spawn there. Killing/plundering them doesn't make the other Quarg angry. Landing on the other Quarg faction's worlds doesn't end with a death sentence when you have their ships/outfits.<br>
