	description "Despite its name, this production model of a recently designed hack job between the classic detainer, newly acquired disruptors, and some raided parts was made to cause shield disruption alongside the traditional slowing effects. The energizing effect this weapon is mockingly named after seems to be a loss byproduct of the conversion process, but is far outweighed by the other benefits of the weapon's modifications, including a larger area of effect and slightly extended range."

	description "A more refined version of the Energizer, meant to be utilized on the new deployable high precision weapon platforms based off the Far Osk automata fighter. It sacrifices power per hit and area of effect for a much faster attack cycle and slightly stronger interference with shields and engines, at even further ranges."

	description "Essentially a TPC stretched out into a firing rig, this 'defensive' artillery weapon fires a ball of plasma that quickly spreads into a devastating wave. Alone, it has little impact on shields, but the sheer heat and impact force it transmits can melt and buckle hull plating anyway, and even carry away smaller ships."
