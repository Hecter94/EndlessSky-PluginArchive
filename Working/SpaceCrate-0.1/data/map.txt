# Original planet
planet Chiron
	attributes "near earth" urban

	description `Chiron is the only planet outside the solar system that was colonized by humanity prior to the discovery of the hyperdrive. It is now the second most populous planet in the Republic, with many sprawling cities and a burgeoning pollution problem.`
	description `	Although Earth still has the most prestigious universities in the galaxy, Chiron has become the de-facto leader in higher education, catering to those who value excellent teaching more highly than an illustrious name. As a result, off-world students form a noticeable fraction of the population.`
	spaceport `There are two spaceports on Chiron. The Old Port was built back when it was first settled, and was placed in a desert region, far from where people would want to live, so that they would not be as affected by the fallout from the nuclear propulsion that was used in the first, pre-hyperspace starships.`
	spaceport `	The New Port, on the other hand, is in the center of New Sydney, one of Chiron's largest cities. Its soaring architecture and gleaming mirrored glass is intended to make a clear statement, that Chiron is everything Earth is not: clean, modern, prosperous.`

	attributes "near earth" urban rich shipping mining farming factory
	landscape land/x-283n1
	description `Obsessed with trade and exports the population of X-283N1 has no time for politics and regulations. They're unified under CEO Arnan de Gans who runs the planet. Whatever goes for a government on the bustling planet is modeled like a corporate aboard of directors which answers only to CEO Arnan de Gans. The self-appointed CEO expects his planet to be profitable and prosperous. Some say X-283N1 is the most prosperous trading powerhouse in the known galaxy.`
	description `Keep an eye out for Arnan as he is sometimes seen in and around Alpha Centauri with his ship the 'StarGoose'. Hail him and say Hi sometime.`
	spaceport `You find the spaceport divided in 2 sectors; A modern looking area packed with warehouse for trading goods and terminals for handling passenger transports this port is situated in a huge industrious area.`
	spaceport `Separated from the main spaceport you notice a mostly military area which appears to be the base for the defense force. But some small trade vessels can be seen there as well.`
