Many years ago during the Turf Wars, we tried to defy nature and genetically alter our bodies to greatly increase our intellectual capacity and to slow our aging processes. Clearly, we succeeded, but it came too late. Those that you likely know as the Alphas had been created and began to enslave many colony planets. We helped to defeat them, but the Alpha War resulted in a rather strong... distain for genetic engineering. Because of what we had done, we were essentially banished from human space. So now we live here, watching what occurs from a distance."`

			`	Landing on Kullat, you try to find the woman who you spoke to before. After asking around a bit, they point you to the main building in the spaceport. You are escorted to a room near the top of the building which overviews the entire spaceport.`
			`	The woman is sitting in a large arm chair while looking at three different monitors. Two of them are filled with lines of data that might be arrival and depature information. The screens rapidly scroll as more data comes up, and she seems to be taking it all in at the same time. The third monitor is displaying a simple game of chess, which she occasionally looks to to make her move.`

			`	You mention the purple wisp that you found in Agon and ask what it is.`
			`	"Oh, yes. The wisp. There is a rather long story to that object, but given the time I have I'll have to give you the short version."`
			`	"Back when we first left human space to colonize these worlds, that wisp was a wormhole. We expanded out to a cluster of systems in the southeast of the galaxy. Things were good early on, but then an alien race known as the Mil'taj came to our systems."`
			`	"At first they seemed friendly. They shared their technology with us and we exchanged stories of our people. But then Quarg appeared. These aliens began fighting the Quarg, and our people were caught in a crossfire. Some of us evacuated to these systems, but those who stayed were swayed to help the Mil'taj. The Mil'taj placed ideas into the heads of many of us that they would give us great technology to get revenge on the humans for casting us out, but only if we helped fight the Quarg. Some accepted, and the Quarg were run out of the systems."`
			`	"Those who remained in these systems north of the Deep did not like the idea of attacking the humans. A short war broke out between us and those that stayed with the Mil'taj, who began calling themselves the Plenipotent Dominion."`
			`	"After fighting to a stalemate and pushing all of the Dominion out of these systems, we severed the wormhole to keep the Dominion away from humanity, and that wisp is all that remains of the wormhole."`
			choice
				`	"How were you able to destroy the wormhole?"`
				`	"Are you afraid that they may be able to rebuild the wormhole and return?"`
				
			`	"It is much easier to destroy than to create. The technology needed to create a wormhole is far greater than that which is needed to destroy one. All we needed to do was drop a nuke right above the wormhole and detonate it. The resulting explosion shook the stressed space of the wormhole and caused it to snap. The Dominion will never be able to reopen the wormhole, at least not for the next 154,125,257 years."`
			`	"Now that I have told you this, I need to get back to work."`
			`	Delilah motions to the escorts to take you out, and they guide you back to your ship in the spaceport.`

They sent large warships with jump drives, able to travel between stars that are not linked. For decades, this war went on, and over the time we collected many jump drives. Suddenly, the war stopped, leaving us confused."`
			`	"Many of those who fought the Korath did not want to stop fighting. They had grown complacent in war after fighting for so many years. Those Hai traveled to the north and controlled three worlds and began to fight the Hai of the Quarg. We, the Absconded, did not want to see any more war, and as such we took the remaining jump drives to here."`

No terraforming technology was taken, and we did not want to return to Hai space lest we be attacked for leaving. As such, we had to reinvent the technology, and only very recently have we begun terraforming the entire cluster."`
			`	Suddenly, a bell sound comes from the far side of the spaceport and many of the Hai begin walking to their ships.`
