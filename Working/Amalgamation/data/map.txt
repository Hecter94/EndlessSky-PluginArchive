The cargo hold on this colony ship also seems unnaturally big and out of place. The extremely eliptical orbit the craft takes around the planet means that it has a geosynchronous orbit making it especially easy to rendevous with anything launching from the ground. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is a single docking port, located near what looks like the front of the ship. The interior is empty, and dead silent. Fortunately there are still refueling tubes, though instead of having to be manually put on an AI automatically refueled your ship when you docked. `

	description `The planet is teaming with life, there is a colony ship on the planet that is constantly deploying small drones to maintain the near perfect weather conditions. There is not much interesting geography here, other than rolling hills and a small mountain near the south pole. The oceans here are large and lifeless, as the colony ship doesn't deploy any drones into the water. The colony ship itself is constantly flying around, to each continent. `
	spaceport `Trying to dock with the colony ship was quite difficult, because you couldn't hail any pilots, though eventually a computer automatically guided your ship into one of its many docking ports. Walking around on the ship is difficult due to the constant jolt of take off and landing. The ship itself is mostly empty, however this time its halls are filled with the screams of terrified animals being transported to each continent. Refueling tubes are present as well. `

The world is completely off limits to anything that isn't Mil'taj, although you appear to be an exception due to your support of the Mil'taj and your shared hate with their enemies.`
	spaceport `The 'outpost' turned out to be more like a massive room with large columns supporting the roof, which was metal that held up the surface of the planet directly above it. It wouldn't be surprising if the room went on for many kilometers, and the distance from the floor to the ceiling was near impossible to measure, however even the largest of the Mil'taj ships had room to take off and fly around with room to spare, although you find it hard to land due to the room's floor being filled to the max with Mil'taj ships and weapons, and there are some for sale, even to you.`

	landscape land/sky2
	description `The planet is beautiful the world below is almost literally untouched with the entire Pug population living in floating cities, 2000 meters above the surface. The cities float on graviton emitters located on the underside of the building. Due to the massive impact this technology has on the planet, a separate graviton emitter orbits on pricisely the opposite end of the planet, cancelling out the gravitational waves. This also means that cities cover one side the planet, while the other side is only inhabited by large floating needles. `
	spaceport `The spaceport cosists of tiny disks that float around like the cities. Your ship's landing gear is deployed against your will, and your ship lands on just five disks, some fifty meters away from the edge of the city. Stepping out feels surreal, as disks automatically come under your feet as you walk towards the city. Even if you were to fall down, a layer of disks would protect you from a fall.`
