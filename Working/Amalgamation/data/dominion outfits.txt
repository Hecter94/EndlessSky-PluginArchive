	description "Calling this projectile a 'slug' hardly does it justice. A quantum flux generator dramatically reduces the effective mass of this mostly depleted nuclear fuel bolt during acceleration, and returns greater mass once adrift. The half-ton slug itself begins to deteriorate shortly after launch, from impacts with ordinary space dust, coupled with molecular instability caused by the quantum flux generator. The more intact the slug upon impact, the more mass the quantum flux generator has to work with on the rubber-band, i.e. damage and impact force deteriorate with range. Large enough fragments retain residual quantum flux, so they show up on radar until they're almost dust."

	description "The Antimaterial Launcher uses a shot of hyperdrive fuel and a spark of unstable energies to begin IBS acceleration, which then continues through a series of superconducting helical electromagnets to muzzle velocity. Ships caught in the blast are treated to overheating systems and massive damage, while not as impactful as a normal mass driver, these weapons are vastly more powerful, expecially against a host of smaller targets."
