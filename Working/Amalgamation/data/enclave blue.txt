			`You arrive in the spaceport to find an aide waiting for you. "Commander <last>?" he says nervously. You nod. "Follow me."`
			`	An hour or so of non-stop walking later, you arrive in a cavernous chamber dug deep into the bedrock below the spaceport- or at least, you assume it is below the spaceport; you could have easily lost your sense of direction in the labyrinthine sets of tunnels that took you here.`
			`	"The admiral is over in there," the aide says, pointing to one of the tunnels leading off of the room.`
			choice
				`	(Head down the tunnel.)`
			`	Stepping warily, you find Kuznetsov at the end of the tunnel, conversing rapidly with someone you cannot see, obscured by a corner in the rock.`
			choice
				`	(Move around Kuznetsov to see who he's talking to.)`
					goto 1
				`	"You asked for me, sir?"`
			`	Breaking off his conversation, Kuznetsov looks at you. "Indeed I did. Come round here," he says, gesturing to the spot beside him.`
			label 1
			`	You move around him to find a short, grey-skinned humanoid standing in a prison cell, an odd clawlike appendage extruding from its back, a grey prison shift covering the rest of the alien's body. Yellow eyes blink in its head, the eyelids opening and closing from the sides of the eye.`
			`	"This is Lron'iirnak," Kuznetsov says smugly. "A lieutenant for the Kaltheim that we captured during the battle." As Kuznetsov speaks, the Kaltheim in the cell nods its head, the third arm on its back swaying to and fro in the small space above it. "Tell Commander <last> what you told me, Lron'iirnak," the admiral says sternly.`
			`	The alien gulps before opening its mouth and speaking in your native language, albeit in a somewhat archaic format and with the accent of someone from the Deep. "O good Commander," it begins. "My people want no more blood shed, like thee. However, verily do they plan a most heinous assault on thy stars of..." it pauses to think for a second. "Eenunhaem and Visnd."`
			choice
				`	"Innenheim and Svind?"`
			`	Lron'iirnak nods. "They wish not to harm thy people- truly, are they fighting those terrible demons who ruined two worlds and are even now engineering the demise of freedom, the ones they call 'XSZ'. But if thou shalt fight them, what choice have they but to defend themselves?"`
			choice
				`	"So you're saying if we don't fight you, you'll leave us alone?"`
					goto 4
				`	"You're lying. Why would your forces have ever attacked any of our systems then, if all you wanted to do was fight XSZ?"`
			`	The Kaltheim throws its odd, seven-fingered hands up in despair. "My liege, I am but a lowly Lieutenant; the plans and vision of the High Council are above me."`
			choice
				`	"Hmmm... I guess that does make sense."`
					goto 4
				`	"That's it, I have no doubt about it- you're lying."`
			label 3
			`	Lron'iirnak's face turns to stone. "Stupid humans," it says. "Always war, always a fight, always more death." When you try to get it to speak to you again, it refuses. "I see you came to the same conclusion as me," Kuznetsov says to you.`
			choice
				`	"It was the only logical option, sir."`
			`	The admiral nods. "Well, you know what happens now," he says. "Take a fleet to Innenheim. Turn back any Kaltheim forces that try and attack the system, and stay alive."`
			`	You nod, a sense of dread filling you at the thought of another battle.`

			`	A broad grin spreads across the Kaltheim's face. "Contact my leaders, good sirs," it says. "And they will co-ordinate with you our first move against the demons."`
			`	As you and Kuznetsov are walking back to the surface, the Admiral says, "Well? What do you think?"`
			choice
				`	"I think this will let us defeat XSZ faster."`
				`	"I'm suspicious of their intentions, but I think this'll work out in the end."`
			`	Kuznetsov nods his head. "Well, since this was your decision, it's up to you to go and find the Kaltheim capital. Take Lron'iirnak with you as a peace offering."`

			`Upon landing, you find your ship beset by a large group of Kaltheim soldiers, clearly suspicious of your intentions; hoping to diffuse tensions, Lron'iirnak walks down the gangway first, followed by you. While most of the soldiers look at you, astonished, there are some who turn their backs on you, spitting on your feet as Lron'iirnak leads you through the crowd, escorted by a group of black-armoured soldiers.`
			`	A few minutes and a short ride in what seems to be a vehicle powered by an oil-based fuel later, you arrive outside a tall, drab concrete building.`
			`	"Our halls of power, are these!" whispers Lron'iirnak, in an almost reverent tone. The soldiers pile out of the vehicle, before marching you up to the buildings too-small steps, clearly not designed for human legs. You duck through the door, almost banging your head on the frame, and stand up in an enormous room, vaulted pillars of fire-shot marble leaping up to meet the ceiling. Before you can object, Lron'iirnak is herded off down a set of stairs to the side by a pair of the soldiers.`
			`	"This way please," a small shining box on one of their chests says, the sound tinny and startling in this deserted hall- presumably, some special device designed to allow Kaltheim to speak human languages, although where they could have learned them, you have no idea. You follow the troop of fighters until you reach a pair of cast-iron doors, dark and cold, standing imposingly above you. The leader of your escorts presses a few buttons on a glowing, triskaidecagon-shaped keypad, and, with an ominous clanking and rumbling, the doors swing open, narrowly grazing your nose.`
			`	A few hours later, you step out of the room, exhausted from too long of being pushed for questions by the Kaltheim high command. You are tired, but satisfied; you have managed to hash out a peace agreement with the Kaltheim, whereby they will fight side by side with the Enclave to vanquish XSZ. While you cannot help but wonder what their motives may be- all they asked for in return was to be allowed to mix and trade with humans- you do suspect that there may be some Pug influence involved, judging by the none-too hidden references to 'sky-elves' present in your conversations with Lron'iirnak on the way here. Apparently, a Kaltheim ship carrying some of their military commanders will be a day or so behind you.`
			`	However, results are results, and you step out into the dim sunlight of Era'lgin'bl with a good future for this galaxy's people ahead.`

An impressive number of Kaltheim ships- most notably, FIVE Tyar'linhalf 67-Gs!- are landed on a small, fairly flat island a good kilometre or so out from the nearby coast, with both civilians and military personnel pointing at the blue and grey hulls, glinting in the sunlight.`
			`	A few minutes after you land, a Destroyer comes swooping in low over the nearest city dome, flying unevenly, smoke trailing from one of its engines.

Firstly-" Kuznetsov points towards an area on the hologram pulsing bright crimson- "this is where the authorities are all holed up. It isn't anywhere near the biggest settlement, but what it is, is an enormous cave network; presumably the remains of an old mine."`

			`Latent's capital lies smoking and screaming, a not-so stark contrast to the last time you were here. From what you hear, some districts were blown apart from underground; molten rock spewing up in violent eruptions from beneath the surface, presumably the result of orbital bombardment by the Kaltheim. You shudder at the thought of the lost lives.`
			`	A small squadron of Flurries, escorted by an incredibly imposing Muesli Carrier, are taking off as you land, the faint blue glow beneath them belying the fact that they are currently only engaging their repulsor engines.`

			`	You throw yourself and Cathy to the floor underneath the <ship>'s gangplank- the other people milling around the landing site do the same, just as the projectile hits the carrier.`
			``

			``
			`	You open your eyes, ears throbbing numbly. You roll out from under the gangplank, stepping on uneasily soft asphalt as you heave yourself to your feet.`
			`	Of the Muesli Carrier, there is no trace. However, judging by the sizeable chunk ripped out of the skyscrapers above the city, you suspect there are no traces to be found; the projectile was quite clearly a nuke.`
			`	You look around at the other soldiers, engineers and civilians still present. Oddly, many of them have thin streams of blood leaking from their ears. When you put your hand to your own, it comes away reddened.`
			``
			`	A few hours later, the insides of your ears itch as a small stream of miniscule nanobots stitch the remnants of your eardrums back together in the harsh light of a hospital.`
			`	Within a few seconds, you begin to hear the faint whirrings of the nanobots, causing you to flinch instinctively. Another second or two, and you think you can hear at full capacity again. The nurse nearby presses a button on her computer, and they scuttle out of your ears, through a tube of antiseptic solution, and on to the victim lying on the bed adjacent to yours.`
			`	You are quickly discharged, unceremoniously shoved out into a waiting room, where you find Cathy waiting for you. The wound on her head is almost gone now; just a faint red mark on her forehead, stitched up by the nanobots.`
			`	"And all of a sudden, things start to go awfully again," Cathy says dejectedly.`
			choice

"We had a joint force of our troops and Kaltheim troops attacking the biggest bunker we know of- I just heard from Kuznetsov that some neurotoxin, or something, got pumped into the tunnels where they were; the Kaltheim immediately started spazzing out, and as soon as that happened XSZ troops just swamped the rest of our force. Never stood a chance."`
			choice

				`	"Surely they'd have just taken it off..."`
			`	Cathy shakes her head. "No. That Kaltheim was just an engineer-" at your look of cynicism, she breaks off to say "Trust me, I know what their uniforms look like." before continuing: "Which means that they weren't down in the tunnels when XSZ released that bioweapon."`

			`The facility's doors open silently, the darkened glass panels moving gently downwards to allow you access.`
			`	As you step inside, the second set of doors ahead of you remain closed, just as the previous set swishes shut behind you. Before you can take the time to wonder why the interior doors are still shut, however, multiple jets of liquid are sprayed out of the walls, drenching you in what smells like disinfectant.`
			`	After a few moments, the jets of chemicals stop, the excess draining away through hidden gaps in the floor as a high-intensity fan in the ceiling switches on, blowing hot air at you at what feels like mach 2.`
			`	Once you have been fully dried off and thoroughly confused, the doors ahead open, an electronic voice saying something incomprehensible in the Kaltheim language as you step into the lobby of the building.`
			`	The room is startling white, bar-shaped lights on the floor and ceiling illuminating the sterile-looking room. There is some sort of desk in front of you- a reception desk?- but there is nobody manning it. The room is entirely empty.`

			`	Hoping that nobody is watching, you climb over the desk. You are faced with what appears to be a computer monitor, although the input devices seem strange- instead of a simple touch-based system, there is a sphere with various indentations in it that seem to match the setup of the clawlike third appendage characteristic of the Kaltheim.`
			choice
				`	(Try to gain access to the computer.)`
				`	(Go back and wait for someone to appear.)`
					goto 4
			`	Entirely unaware of how Kaltheim computers work, you try pressing the indentations in the sphere. Unfortunately, nothing happens- and even more unfortunately, at that point, a section of the wall to the side of the desk slides upwards, revealing a doorway into a darkened corridor.`
			`	A doorway through which a Kaltheim dressed in a lab coat walks.`
			choice
				`	(Hide behind the desk.)`
				`	(Do nothing.)`
					goto 3
			`	The Kaltheim scientist walks into the centre of the room, a clipboard clutched in their hand as they look round, presumably searching for you. Just as you think that they are about to leave, you hear the buzzing voice of the Kaltheim translation devices ring out, accompanied by presumably the equivalent in the Kaltheim language.`
			`	"Please come out from behind the desk. I know you're there."`
			`	Slowly, you stand up, making yourself visible to the scientist.`
			label 1
			choice
				`	"I'm sorry, I was just curious as to what was behind the desk."`
			`	The Kaltheim shakes their head.`
				goto 6
			label 3
			`	The scientist easily spots you. "What do you think you're doing behind there?" they say, the buzz of their translator conveying no emotion or feeling.`
				goto 1
			label 4
			`	You climb back over the desk and stand against the wall, waiting for someone to find you.`			
			label 5
			`	After waiting for a few minutes, a section of the wall next to the desk slides downwards to reveal a corridor much like the room you are currently in, stretching further than you can see. A Kaltheim dressed in a lab coat steps out through the doorway, a surprisingly human clipboard in their hand.`
			label 6
			`	"You must be Commander <first> <last>," the Kaltheim says through their translator, walking briskly over to you. They stick their hand towards you in what you assume is a crude imitation of human customs.`
			`	Not wanting to offend the scientist, you take their hand and awkwardly shake it. "My name is Feun'ragnam," the Kaltheim tells you. "While I am told our gender system is very different to that of you humans, you may refer to me as female, if it so helps you. Now, follow me. The laboratories are this way." Having no opportunity to argue, you follow Feun'ragnam back into the hallway from where she came.`
			label 7
			`	After a few steps, it becomes apparent that the hallway is in fact on a gentle slope downwards. All you can see ahead is a very uniform corridor design, completely silent apart from yours and Feun'ragnam's footsteps and the gentle whirring of the electronics.`
			``
			`	An hour of walking later, and you must be very deep into the crust of <origin>; if the facility had simply been dug into a mountainside or something, you almost certainly would have come out the other side by now.`
			`	In fact, you've been walking for so long that you can actually see a set of visible doors in front of you. Striding ahead, Feun'ragnam says something in the Kaltheim tongue- which, surprisingly, isn't translated- and the doors slide open to reveal a small chamber, presumably an elevator.`
			`	"The laboratories are deep within the moon's crust, on the very edge of the primitive mantle which it has developed," Feun'ragnam says. "This is the only way down."`
			`	As you step inside, the doors sealing and closing with a high-pitched pneumatic hum to maintain the pressure inside the elevator, you cannot help but feel a more than slight sense of trepidation about travelling miles downwards with this elevator as your only way out. You feel slightly heavier as the artifical gravity switches on, returning somewhat to your normal mass as the lift begins to descend at what must be breakneck speed.`
			`	After a surprisingly short five minutes of descent, the elevator begins to slow; according to the altimeter, you should be almost at the bottom of the crust, although the temperature in the elevator doesn't feel like it.`
			`	"We have arrived," Feun'ragnam announces as the elevator fully stops. The scientist yanks a large, red lever in the wall labelled with Kaltheim glyphs, and the chamber once again hisses with air as the pressure inside the elevator equalises with that of the complex beyond the doors. A few seconds later, the doors open, and Feun'ragnam heads out into the laboratory system.`
			``
			`	It is surprisingly cool down here; this close to the mantle, the air should be swelteringly hot, even on a small moon like this with what must be a relatively cool core, at least for one with tectonic activity.`
			choice
				`	"The temperature- why is it so cool down here?"`
				`	(Say nothing.)`
					goto 8
			`	Feun'ragnam turns around. "You know our ships, yes?" You nod in reply. "Our race is naturally suited to the cold," she says. "The result of thousands of years of slavery and selective breeding, forced upon us by another species. When we discovered that <origin> had enough tectonic activity to be able to sustain life, while not rising above our livable temperatures, it was the perfect moon for shipbuilding; low gravity, temperate albeit dry climate, large reserves of compounds required for our ships."`
			`	The scientist pauses for a second. "We have been building our warships here for centuries," Feun'ragnam continues. "Unfortunately, a quarry for the ores we need for our ships went down too far. They broke through into the core, the only liquid rock on the moon. The sudden exposure of the core to the cold air outside caused some kind of reaction that resulted in a vast amount of the hot matter at the core of the moon being dragged out and expelled into the atmosphere."`
			choice
				`	"So, some miners accidentally sucked the entire core of the moon out?"`
			`	She nods. "And now the moon is slowly becoming less and less habitable. In a few hundred years- our years, circuits of Era'lgin'bl around Fo'gar'helien- it is likely we will no longer be able to survive here." Feun'ragnam sighs. "Such a waste."`
			label 8
			`	You soon reach another set of doors, startling white like everything else, standing out in contrast to the rough stone walls lining the tunnel you are currently standing in.`
			`	An imperceptible security check of some kind, and the doors open, allowing you and Feun'ragnam to enter the laboratory complex.`
			`	There appear to be four other corridors leading off from the area where you are standing, seemly some kind of intersection, presumably leading to the specific labs.`
			`	"We have four hundred and ninety-two scientists working non-stop to devise a cure for the bioweapon's effects," Feun'ragnam says from beside you. "Eight billion koriums invested in saving our species, and we have got exactly nowhere. There is nothing that we have that can stop it, and we can't go off-planet or we'll risk catching it. Hopeless."`
			choice
				`	"So is that why I'm here?"`
			`	At that moment, a group of three or so more Kaltheim scientists round the corner and stop, seemingly startled by your presence. Feun'ragnam almost immediately begins speaking rapidly to them in the Kaltheim language, seemingly due to their apparent lack of translators.`
			`	Their short conversation ending, one of the other scientists turns to you and bows, saying something in Kaltheim. "Commander <last>," Feun'ragnam's translator barks out, translating for the other Kaltheim. "You know why you are here?"`
			choice
				`	"...because you asked me to come?"`
				`	"You need me to get you samples or whatever from human space?"`
					goto 10
			`	The scientist appears to chuckle. "No,"	Feun'ragnam's translator replies. "We summoned you here for help in our research. It is too dangerous for any Kaltheim to travel into human space and risk catching the contagion; we have quarantines set up which should contain it within our own space."`
			`	"However," another of the scientists says, "As our colleague will have told you, we need data from the development of the bioweapon. We cannot go, for fear of dying."`
			choice
				`	"But I can."`
			`	"Because you are human, and the bioweapon is targeted specifically at Kaltheim DNA," the same scientist replies, apparently pleased with you.`
			label 9
			`	"So," Feun'ragnam says. "Will you help us?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure."`
					goto 11
			label 10
			`	"Correct," another scientist replies. "If we went, we would die from exposure to traces of the bioweapon. But as it is genetically coded only to target we Kaltheim, you can safely enter the facilities where it was developed."`
				goto 9
			label 11
			`	"Excellent," Feun'ragnam replies, becoming more animated. "Firstly, we would like you to visit <destination>. According to our intelligence, the planet is frequently used for large-scale experiments; it's likely that Affalan is where the bioweapon tests were conducted."`
			choice
				`	"So, how do I actually find any data?"`
			`	"We have developed powerful scanning systems which can scan an entire planet for traces of a single type of organism," the first scientist says. "You can use them to scan the planet for concentrations of the bioweapon; the areas with the highest concentrations of it should correlate to the location of testing facilities."`
			choice
				`	"Understood."`
			`	"The scanning equipment will have been loaded onto your ship already," Feun'ragnam says as you walk back through the miles-long tunnel up near the surface.`
			choice
				`	"That's fast."`
			`	"Our crews are efficient, Commander <last>," the Kaltheim replies. "Good luck," she continues, after a short pause. "Our species' entire existence depends on you now."`
			choice
				`	"Well, I'll try not to let you all die horrifically."`
				`	"I guarantee you that I'll find what you need."`
			`	"What a comfort," Feun'ragnam replies through her translator.`

As the scanners start up and begin their first procedures, you notice a siginificant drop in the amount of geographical data you're receiving from your sensors- dangerously so; you feel a jolt as your ship scrapes against a remarkably high cliff face, your shields thankfully protecting the hull from any major harm.`

However, there is a small spot, only a square kilometre or two in size, on one of the southern continents which boasts a much higher concentration of the bioweapon than anywhere else.`
			choice

			`	You circle back round, plotting a course for the bioweapon-ridden area. During the flight there, you take the time to get into an armoured hazmat suit; if XSZ cooked up the bioweapon here, you have no idea what kind of other dangerous stuff could be holed up in the facility.`
			`	Your ship touches down not too far off the facility, at the edge of the concentrated zone of bioweapon, leaving you a small trek in your hazmat suit to get to the facility.`
			`	Back when XSZ was still around, there were never any personnel stationed on Affalan- the climate was far too changeable, and insuring any personnel would have been far too expensive for XSZ. As a result, the only workers in the facility should be unarmed drones- unless a group of ex-XSZ fugitives are hiding out in the facility, which is unlikely, to say the least.`

			`	On the other side, the ground is packed rubble, held together by cement; a crude job. Up ahead, the facility glows red in your visor, the software from the Kaltheim scanning equipment copied over into your suit's internal computer and heads-up display.`
