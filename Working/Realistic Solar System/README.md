# Realistic-Solar-System
This plugin modifies the Sol system adding every planet, large moon (over 20!) and two dwarf planets (Ceres and Pluto with its moon, Charon), each with unique sprites modified from NASA pictures taken during various missions. Everything in Sol has also been resized to a much bigger and realistic size, including the Sun itself.

In vanilla, the solar system has:
 - 5 planets
 - 5 moons
 - a 90x90 star

With this plugin, it gets:
- 8 planets
- 20 moons
- 2 dwarf planets
- a 450x450 star

And all of this with 31 unique sprites, plus other 30 high DPI ones included in the package!
