Adds unique crew members, aquireable through low chance spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc. See the README for details.
