### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through low chance missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regenaration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 20 expert crew members. Visit spaceports on human worlds with an outfitter to find the missions.(2% chance)<br>
The technology fields are: hull(2), energy(2), storage(3), scanner(3), cooling(3), engine(2), fuel(3), shield(2)<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a medium human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
