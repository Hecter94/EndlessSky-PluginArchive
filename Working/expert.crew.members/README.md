### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 95 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Successor, Avgi(after first contact), Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(10) cooling(10) energy(10) engine(10) fuel(10) hull(9) jamming(9) scanner(9) shield(9) storage(9).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salary of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission.<br>
