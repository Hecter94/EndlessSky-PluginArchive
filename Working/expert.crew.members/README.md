### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 40 expert crew members. Visit spaceports on human worlds with an outfitter to find the missions(5% chance).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(4) cooling(5) energy(4) engine(3) fuel(5) hull(3) jamming(4) scanner(4) shield(3) storage(5).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a medium human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
See data/crew.list.txt of this plugin for locations, an stat infos.<br>
