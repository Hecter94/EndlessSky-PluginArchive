### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 85 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(8) cooling(8) energy(8) engine(8) fuel(8) hull(8) jamming(8) scanner(8) shield(8) storage(8).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salery of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission<br>
