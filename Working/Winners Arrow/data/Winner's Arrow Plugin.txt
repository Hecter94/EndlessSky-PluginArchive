	description "Modeled after its dimunuitive transport cousin, the Arrow, Winner's Arrow is a whole different animal. Built as a combination of flag ship and priority courier, this is one the fastest ships ever produced. However, to keep the vessel fast the engineers had to vastly decrease hall strengh. This ship is much better suited to run from a battle than fight in one. However, its to forward Proton guns are more than able to hanlde any ill equiped pirates."
