Adds the new system 'Mego Pug', in eastern Bunrodea space. There you can farm rare spawning Arfectas and other more common Pug ships, without ruining your Pug reputation.<br>
<br>
Added a new system, with new government "Pug Farm" and 3 new fleets. Two fleets are like the ones in 'Pug Iyek' and the third, rare spawning one, has 1 arfecta. It spawns within 15000 frames(~4 minutes).<br>
