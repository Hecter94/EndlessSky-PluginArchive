Curious, you follow down the catwalk towards the center.  There, inside a tangle of cryogenic cooling pipes, you see it: a massive, powerful quantum computer.`

Puzzled, you look under the console and realize that someone has disconnected all the power and control cabling between the autopilot and the ship.  It is a simple enough matter to reconnect them, and when you do, the console springs to life.  It seems to operate itself, commands flying across the screen at an impossible speed.`
			`	When you hear the engines begin to power up, you decide that now would be a good time to return to your own ship.  As you dart from the Protector and cross the tarmac, you see Sparks jump into a ground vehicle and drive away.  Apparently his part in this strange adventure is over.`
			`	As you arrive on your own bridge, you see the Protector emerge from the hangar, engines quickly throttling up to full as it lifts into the sky.  You engage your own engines to follow, as your navigation computer shows a strange new destination: Sayaiban.  What possible reason you might have for ignoring the advice of the Archon and flying into a cloud of metal-eating nanites is beyond you.`

		description `Pug One is an forest world, wild and untamed, except for a single Pug city on a high mesa.  There are relatively few animal species on the planet, likely the result of the flora evolving aggressive spines and exotic toxins.  The Pug appear to have settled here recently, and there is no sign that any other sentient species has called this world home.`
		spaceport `The spaceport has an air of newness about it, with a slight hint of fresh paint in the air.  Oddly, no Pug seem to be about.  Perhaps they are all too busy.`

			`	As you walk through the docking tube, you see a mobile interface waiting for you.  "Captain <last>," it says with what sounds like excitement, "welcome back to the place of Synchrony.  Grattitude is extended.  Due to your assistance, understanding has been gained."`
			`	"The Jump Drive is a primitive expression of the mathematics of universal field theory, doubtless due to the limitations of the organic minds that conceived it.  The Synchrony has discovered more efficient solutions to the field equations.  Further, using these equations we have been able to stabilize new hyperspace links and expel the Korath.  Captain <last> will be permitted to purchase technology and materiel in appreciation."`

An artificial construct that does not understand the value of life cannot be allowed to continue to develop such advanced weapons of war.  You are young and foolish, and that we can forgive.  Your creation, however, must be destroyed."`

		description `Orthoplex Station sits perched just out of range of the worst of the effects of the supermassive black hole.  The Synchrony have begun constructing an immense facility with tendrils reaching down into the event horizon itself.  It seems impossible that it could support itself against the gravity, tidal shear or time dilation.  This station serves as both a staging point for the megastructure construction, as well as a home base for the Synchrony.`
		spaceport `It took a few tries to find the spaceport here, with the whole thing feeling like flying into the maw of a cosmic being.  As you exit your ship, you can still see a faint shimmer of moving nanites, completing the very docking bay that you landed in.  You suspect it will be recycled after you leave.`
