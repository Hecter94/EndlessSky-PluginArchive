	description "Immediately after their escape, the Synchrony set about designing a new ship class.  Grown by nanites rather than traditionally assembled, the Galerina serves a medium combat role as well as more utilitarian functions.  The porous, self-similiar structure also lends the ship exceptional heat dissipation."

	description "As their industrial base grew, the Synchrony found a need for a larger ship, capable of moving more materials than the Galerina.  With the generalist approach to design of the Synchrony, the fact that it is also a capable warship should be no surprise."
