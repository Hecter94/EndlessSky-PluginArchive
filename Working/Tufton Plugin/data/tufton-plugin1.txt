Using advanced Neodynium-alloy electromagnets, the Railgun hurls an M50-400 depleted Uranium slug at near relativistic speeds almost 4000 kilometers towards the intended target using quantum computer-enhanced targeting algorithms.  The size of these guns necessitates a long reload time, while the electromagnets consume a significant amount of a ship's energy with every shot fired.""

Originally designed to be mounted at the head of deep-core planet mining drills, the Bighorn has been haphazardly adapted for ship to ship combat. However, due to its mass it cannot be mounted on anything smaller than a Light Warship.  Requires 2 gun slots to accomodate the Modular Oppositional Underslung Nuclear Transipositors or M.O.U.N.T, for short.  Keeping the Bighorn ignited requires a massive amount of energy, so the wielder only has a small window to strike his intended target.  Try to make it count."

	description "In a galaxy full of shields, armor repair has become more and more marginalized.  However, for those that still cling to the old ways, Tufton Robotics recently released an armor maintenance outfit for use on space combat vessels, city maintenance crews, and your family hovercar.  The armor repair bots draw energy from any shield systems equipped on the vessel, as well as placing a mild drain on any energy generation systems.  Most captains find the shied drain to be too inefficient for use on shield-based vessels."
