	description "After encountering an increasing number of pirate raids weilding munitions instead of the lower cost beam weaponry, a government-funded panel looked for ways to counteract them. The Republic chose to work with Lionheart Shipyards due to their advanced engines."
	description "A light warship with only light weaponry but enough speed to chase down interceptors is the end result. Due to the multi-party nature of the contract, a new naming convention was applied. The Navy has grown fond of the Recluse's name for it's menacing appearance and effectiveness at taking out small craft. It is widely speculated, however, that Lionheart chose the name for its distaste with the project."
