Akasha Chronicles is a progressive storyline giving you access to new technology and ships over time.

Featuring:
* New Goverments
* 16 New Ships
* 30 New Outfits and Weapons
* Storyline with around 30 Missions with lots of dialog and choices (hope you will make the right ones)
* 40 New Systems, Planets, Land and event sprites to bring a fitting atmosphere for the story (google images)
* Some hidden outfits which you can get during missions (going places you perhaps shouldn't)
* Changing Environment

You can start the storyline in the Kor Efret Space (the nice Koraths) after you finish the Wanderers storyline. 
The difficulty should be a good fit for people who are done with the Wanderers storyline.

## Installation
You must create a "plugins" folder in one of two places, depending on your operating system:

### Linux ###
* /usr/share/endless-sky/plugins/
* ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

### Windows ###
* plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)
* C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\

### Mac OS X ###
* Content/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)
* ~/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins

Download the latest [release][releases] and extract it into your plugins folder.
