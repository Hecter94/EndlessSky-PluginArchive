	description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the Energy Blaster is popular because it is small enough to be installed on even the tiniest of ships. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

Sophisticated software algorithms allow the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

	description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere. A Beam Laser has a slightly shorter range than an Energy Blaster, but is also much more energy-efficient and does a comparable amount of damage."

	description "The Heavy Laser is an upgraded Beam Laser with a significantly longer range and higher power. It is mostly intended for larger ships, where energy and space are plentiful, but some pilots consider a single Heavy Laser to be a worthwhile alternative to a pair of Beam Lasers, because the longer range makes up for the fact that it does not quite deal twice as much damage."

	description "Centuries ago, space battles were fought mostly with missiles, with the outcome dependent only on which ship had more shielding or ammunition.

	description "The Heavy Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller sibling.

	description "Torpedoes are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

	description "Named for its distinctive firing sound, the Screamer Pod unleased a flurry of unguided missiles in an attempt to overwhelm anti-missile systems with sheer numbers. The space normally reserved for tracking equipment has instead been used for a larger warhead, so Screamers do a surprising amount of damage for their size."

	description "The Tomahawk Missile is designed by Lovelace Labs, which is ironically also designed of the Anti-Missile Turret. Rumors say that the two engineering teams at Lovelace who make the missiles and the anti-missiles are locked in furious competition with each other: the result has been generation after generation of smarter missiles and then smarter turrets to fend them off. The newer Tomahawk missile has replaced the older Hatchet almost entirely, and is sold almost everywhere."
