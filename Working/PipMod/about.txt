	FEATURES:

Major weapon rebalance:

Blaster - Basic Projectile. Average firerate, average DPS, etc etc etc.
Mod. Blaster - Higher firerate at the cost of heat and energy.
Beam Laser - Anti-Fighter. Constant damage and energy drain, lower damage but perfect accuracy. Better against shields.
Heavy Laser - Higher range and damage at the cost of space and energy.
Electron Beam - Higher range, but lower damage against Hull. Rapidly kills shields.
Particle Cannon - Anti-Ship. Long range, very slow firerate, high damage. Very high energy requirement, superconductors are a must. Better against hull. Single barrelled turret.
Proton Gun - Anti-Fighter. Shotguns submunitions everywhere. Slow firerate, and eats up energy. No turret version.
Plasma Cannon - Anti-Ship. Slow munition, but deals high damage and heat. Single barrelled turret.
Pulse Cannon - Similar to Blaster, but slightly higher firerate.
Ion Cannon - Deals heavy damage to shields and energy. Zero damage to hull.

Comet Torpedo (Typhoon) - Anti-Ship. Even slower than the Meteor, but anything it hits DIES. Extremely limited ammo.
Flamethrower - Very little damage, but causes rapid heat buildup. No turret version.
Hai Tracker - Long range, average damage. Difficult for point-defence, but tracks slowly.
Jackhammer Missile (Heavy Rocket) - Anti-Ship. Improved version of Tomahawk. Higher damage and survivability for less capacity. Easily carried by fighters.
Meteor Torpedo (Torpedo) - Anti-Ship. High damage and long range, but slow and tracks slowly.
Sidewinder Missile - Anti-Fighter. Fast, low damage, hard to intercept. High tracking, but short range. Has turret version.
Screamer Rocket (Javelin) - Unguided, rapid fire rocket. Designed to overwhelm point-defence. Low damage, but extremely cheap and can carry a lot.
Tomahawk Missile (Meteor) - Basic Missile. Easily beaten by point-defence, but cheap.

Peacemaker (Nuclear Missile) - Anti-Everything. High damage in a large radius. Limited to 1 shot.

Overall, apart from some exceptions, weapon DPS is about half of what it is vanilla. Alien weapons are still inordinarily strong.


Modified Freighers:
Some freighters will have an additional variant that you can buy which will offer a cheap way to get fighter/drone slots. There is also a variant of the Sparrow as a Fighter.
These modified ships have been included in some fleets.
