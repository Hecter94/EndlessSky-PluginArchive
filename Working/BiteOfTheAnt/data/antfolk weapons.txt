	description "This weapon is a rather simplistic and primitive example of space age bioweapons. It is little more than a gun which shoots massive plant thorns that are grown fairly quickly, and shot out even faster."
	description "The Antfolk's method of producing organic ballistics ammunition so rapidly and on-board the ship that'll be using them is complex and beyond your grasp. However, you have a sense that some kind of growth hormone is involved, most likely combined with some advanced form of hydroponic gardening. The Antfolk must be very good at biotechnology to have designed and miniaturized that system, and you can only guess at how they could have invented such advanced technology and yet weaponized it so poorly."

	description "The Antfolk, a race brilliant enough to genetically engineer a biological machine with an exoskeleton that can, in at least one spot and axis, turn on a 360 degree pivot (a feature previously unheard of among biological organisms). They should've been able to take all the work that designing this turret must've taken and instead put it towards making a more powerful weapon system. Instead, they chose to use this technology to put two Thorn Guns on a swivel."

	description "One of the Antfolk's more inventive weapons, they have managed to repurpose the waste from their cooling systems into acidic splash projectiles as ammunition for organic missile launchers. While not the fastest missiles around, and actually being closer to acidic snot balls than real missiles, these projectiles stick to any ship they're hit with, slowing them down, and will 'splash' onto nearby ships similar to the shrapnel of some human-made missiles."
