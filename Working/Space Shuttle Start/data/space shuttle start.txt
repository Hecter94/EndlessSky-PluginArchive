	description `You were born on New Boston, but moved to Earth at a young age. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. A few years later, your dream came true when you got a bargain on an old Earth relic that was up for auction. After many years working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to fix the shuttle, but there's still a debt to pay off.`

	`Earth...`
	`	This is the world that all the tourists want to visit, and that no one wants to live on. Ten billion people, more industry and exports than any other place in the galaxy. The spaceport is big and crowded. The sheer number of people here is almost overwhelming. Homeless men wrapped in old army blankets beg money from well-dressed businessmen. Soldiers in Navy uniforms walk by in groups of ten or twenty, all marching in unison. Starship captains haggle with merchants over trade goods and jobs. Flashes of light come from various landing bays as welders make repairs.`
	`	None if this is new to you. Although you were born on New Boston, most of your life was spent here. You've visited the port authority in the past to register your ship and reserve parking. Today you've returned to schedule a launch.`
	`	"Name?" asks the government agent when you reach the front of the line.`
	`	You answer:`
	name

	`	You pull out your license in anticipation of being asked for it, but the agent frowns while looking through her database. "I don't see <first> <last> registered here. What kind of ship is it?"`

		`	"<first> <last> is my name. Lookup '<ship>'."`

		`	"Just schedule a launch time."`

			`Originally, the space shuttle relied on massive booster rockets to launch into space. Like all modern ships, your space shuttle has repulsors installed instead. The ride into orbit is smooth and soon you feel the subtle shift from Earth's gravity to the weightlessness of space. Most ships have artificial gravity. Unfortunately, <ship> isn't one of them. As <ship> passes a few satellites, you look down on the planet. From up here, it doesn't look so bad.`

	description `The construction of the original International Space Station was a milestone of humanities earliest attempts at gaining a foothold into space. Sadly, it was destroyed during the early Turf Wars. This station was created as a monument to the original. While the exterior matches visual records of what the first I.S.S. looked like, the interior layout has replaced the science and research labs with a museum dedicated to the history of human space exploration.`
	spaceport `Many of the visitors are families or students on school field trips. The gift shop next to the docking ports sells various historically accurate models, science kits, and other knick-knacks meant to appeal to parents and teachers looking for something educational to bring home from their visit.`
