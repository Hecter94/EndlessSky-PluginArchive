	description `You were born on New Boston, but moved to Earth at a young age. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. A few years later, your dream came true when you got a bargain on an old Earth relic that was up for auction. After many years working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to fix the shuttle, but there's still a debt to pay off.`

conversation "space shuttle intro"
	scene "planet/earth"
	`Earth...`
	`	This is the world that all the tourists want to visit, and that no one wants to live on. Ten billion people, more industry and exports than any other place in the galaxy. The spaceport is big and crowded. The sheer number of people here is almost overwhelming. Homeless men wrapped in old army blankets beg money from well-dressed businessmen. Soldiers in Navy uniforms walk by in groups of ten or twenty, all marching in unison. Starship captains haggle with merchants over trade goods and jobs. Flashes of light come from various landing bays as welders make repairs.`
	`	None if this is new to you. Although you were born on New Boston, most of your life was spent here. You've visited the port authority in the past to register your ship and reserve parking. Today you've returned to schedule a launch.`
	`	"Name?" asks the government agent when you reach the front of the line.`
	`	You answer:`
	name
	scene "outfit/license"
	`	You pull out your license in anticipation of being asked for it, but the agent frowns while looking through her database. "I don't see <first> <last> registered here. What kind of ship is it?"`
	choice
		`	"Sorry, that's my name. My ship is the '<ship>'."`
		`	"<first> <last> is my name. Lookup '<ship>'."`
	scene "scene/space shuttle"
	`	She types in the name of your ship then gasps. "So you're the owner of that old thing? Are you sure it'll fly?"`
	choice
		`	"I oversaw the repairs myself."`
		`	"Just schedule a launch time."`
	scene "scene/space shuttle 2"
	`	"Alright, you're set to launch in an hour. That should be enough time to buy life insurance if you don't already have it."`
	`	This isn't the most reassuring start to your journey...`

			`Originally, the space shuttle relied on massive booster rockets to launch into space. Like all modern ships, your space shuttle has repulsors installed instead. The ride into orbit is smooth and soon you feel the subtle shift from Earth's gravity to the weightlessness of space. Most ships have artificial gravity. Unfortunately, <ship> isn't one of them. As <ship> passes a few satellites, you look down on the planet. From up here, it doesn't look so bad.`
