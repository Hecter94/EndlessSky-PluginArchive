			`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
		log "Factions" "Syndicate" `The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
			`The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`
		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space.`

			`With some trepidation, you take your ship for a test drive, piloting it out of the parking hangar and onto a spare landing pad. Then you get out and look the ship over a bit more closely. You are busy polishing out a few rust spots with a piece of steel wool when an old man in grease-stained coveralls walks up.`

			`You drop off the shipment of <commodity> on <planet>, and collect your payment of <payment>. "Hauling freight," says James. "Not the most glamorous job, or the most interesting, but you're always guaranteed steady income. If you can line them up right," says James, "rush deliveries can be your best source of income as a freighter captain. And keep your eye out for missions with large amounts of cargo, too, because <ship>'s hold is definitely big enough to handle them. And if you've got any cargo space to spare and you know what the prices are going to be at your destination, be sure to stock up on something you can sell for a profit. And once you know the galaxy a bit better, instead of taking missions you can find your own trade routes to follow. The only trouble is, build up a fleet with lots of cargo space and not enough defenses and the pirates begin to take notice."`

If you need to make lots of money in a hurry, bounty hunting is the way to go, but nine out of ten pilots who give bounty hunting a try end up dead. And, no one's going to give you those sorts of missions until you've proved yourself in combat, anyway."`

			`You find James in the spaceport bar, talking with a woman wearing a business suit. The expression on James's face is growing increasingly concerned as she speaks. Seeing you come in, he waves to you and you join them at the table.`
			`	"Hello <first>," says James. "This is Marissa, a senior manager at the mines." You shake hands with her.`
			`	"Here's the deal," says Marissa. "Most of the gemstones we mine here are industrial grade, not pretty enough to be worth using as anything but sandpaper grit or drill bits. But every once in a while we happen on some higher quality gems. No one in this sector has the money to spend on jewelry, so we ship them north to the paradise worlds.`
			`	"But in the past few months, every shipment we've sent has been attacked by a pirate ship, the Hammer of Thor. We don't have the money to pay a bounty hunter to take out the Hammer, so instead we're going to pay you to outrun it. Is the <ship> a fast ship?"`

The Hammer's shields are ten times as strong as yours, and if it's able to bring its weapons to bear, we'll be dead in two seconds. So, the moment we're in the sky, we head straight for hyperspace.

Also, if it has anti-missile turrets, you can't count on hanging back and bombarding it with missiles from long distances. So, don't risk it. It's like rock paper scissors; recognize what your enemy's strengths and weaknesses are, as well as your own."`

Now this might seem counterintuitive, but some captains swear that being unarmed makes you less of a target to pirates if there are others in the system that they could be defending themselves against.

			`As you land on Ingot, James says, "Well, you made it in one piece!"`

				`	"What would you recommend if I want to do more than just carry cargo?"`
			`	He pauses for a moment to think, then says, "Unless you want to do something really risky like hunting pirates, your best bet is to work with the Navy, or the Syndicate, or one of the local militias. Any of those would be a decent choice, although they've each got their own problems. If any of them offer you a mission, go ahead and take it; that's a good way to build connections and get to know the lay of the land."`
			choice
				`	"Was that what you did for your whole career?"`
			`	"Well," he says, "Back when I was a bit older than you, I piloted a Firebird for a while, escorting merchant convoys up and down the Rim. I used to hope we'd get attacked; I'd disable the pirate ships and rob them blind. Turnabout is fair play, after all.`
			`	"Then one day I got a bit too greedy and thought I'd try to capture a pirate ship or two, to add more firepower to my fleet. We boarded their ship, and I sent my crew through the airlock to kill off the pirates. And it turns out the pirates had grenades. Four of my men were dead before I even realized what was happening. We had to retreat, and then limp back to port without even enough crew left uninjured to pilot the ship right. After that I decided to stick to less risky jobs."`
			``
			`"Anyway, let's go get your payment." You walk out of the ship and sign the papers to hand off the <commodity> to the dock workers on <planet>. They hand you a credit chip worth <payment>.`
