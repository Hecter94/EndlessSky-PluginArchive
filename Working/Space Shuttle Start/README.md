# Space-Shuttle-Start
An alternate start for Endless Sky.

Start in the Sol system with an old Earth relic for your ship.

The space shuttle has no weapons, but lots of cargo space.

It has an Afterburner.

"You were born on New Boston, but moved to Earth at a young age. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. A few years later, your dream came true when you got a bargain on an old Earth relic that was up for auction. After many years working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to fix the shuttle, but there's still a debt to pay off."
