# Posting Issues
When posting a new issue, please:

* Check to make sure it's not a duplicate of an existing issue.
* Create a separate "issue" for each bug you are reporting and each feature you are requesting.
* Do not use the issues page for things other than bug reports and feature requests.

# Posting Pull Requests
When posting a pull request, please:

* Do not combine multiple unrelated changes.
* Check the diff and make sure the pull request does not contain unintended changes.
* Check your pull request against the latest release version – and the latest stable release of Endless Sky – to make sure it still works (in case you were developing with an earlier version)

# Issue Labels
The following issue labels are used:
* __Bug__: There is a bug. It could be any kind of bug. Issues reported using the bug template are given this label by default.
* __Documentation__: Something in the documentation needs to be fixed. Alternatively, this could mean that the issue is a request for something to be added to the documentation.
* __Duplicate__: Something very much like this already exists.
* __Enhancement__: This issue is a feature request, not a bug report.
* __Gameplay__: This bug is serious. It changes the gameplay entirely.
* __Good First Issue__: This should be relatively simple to fix and provide some understanding into how everything works.
* __Help Wanted__: This is a very complicated issue that will need a lot of work.
* __Invalid__: Something about the issue isn't right: maybe it can't be reproduced, maybe it isn't a bug with the plugin at all but rather one in [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/).
* __Question__: Further information about the issue has been requested.
* __Typo__: This is a minor issue that doesn't affect gameplay, such as a typo, but that may make things confusing or annoying for players.
* __Unconfirmed__: This bug hasn't been reproduced yet. _Every_ bug report should have this label by default.
* __Wontfix__: This bug won't be fixed, or isn't a bug.

# What to Work On
Please do not work on developing the plot at this time. Instead, I would welcome help with:

* New (or rather old) ships – see [here](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingShips) for a guide on how to do that.
* One or two primitive missile systems.
* Nuclear engines (designed to be cheap but very power and heat intensive).
* Change things with alien species so that things make sense for that time (such as not having loads of human merchants on Allhome).

If you haven't done much development with Endless Sky stuff, you can still help! Simpler, but even more important, tasks include:

* Fleshing out mission conversations to make them slightly more interesting for players.
* Fixing typos.
* Reporting bugs.
