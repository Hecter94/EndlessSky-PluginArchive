	`You stand in front of your new ship, amazed by its metallic beauty. You know that it isn't quite the largest ship available for sale, but it is still a prototype of Deep's newest ship design.`
	`	The recruitment officer is gesturing to a rather large pile of paperwork, which appears to mostly be lists of things you aren't allowed to do and list of things that the company isn't responsible for.
