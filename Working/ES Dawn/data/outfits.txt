	description "The Terran Union License is a way of restricting the sale of powerful naval warships like the Frigate to trustworthy individuals. Although you can buy one instead of meeting the other qualifications, the price of a Terran Union License is so great that most people opt for alternatives to the Frigate instead."

	description "The Comet Staged Missile is designed as a way to hit targets from a very long distance away. It can lock on to a target, then get close, before finally deploying a fast, manueverable warhead that not even a fighter can dodge. Unfortunately, Comet Staged Missiles are rather expensive and not very powerful, which is the primary reason for their waning popularity."

	description "The Heavy Laser is an upgraded Beam Laser with a significantly longer range and higher power. It is mostly intended for larger ships, where energy and space are plentiful, but some pilots consider a single Heavy Laser to be a worthwhile alternative to a pair of Beam Lasers, because the longer range makes up for the fact that it does not quite deal twice as much damage."

	description "Although not the most accurate or damaging of weapons, the Energy Blaster has been in service for over two hundred years and shows no sign of losing its popularity. One blaster is not enough to do appreciable damage to anything larger than a fighter, but a ship equipped with several of them becomes a force to be reckoned with."

	description "The Particle Cannon works by accelerating a short burst of particles to near-relativistic speeds. When mounted on a ship that can turn fast enough to keep it trained on approaching ships, it becomes a nearly unbeatable weapon, capable of destroying smaller ships before they can even approach close enough for their comparatively short-ranged weapons to be effective."

	description "Laser Turrets are hated by fighter pilots because it is nearly impossible to dodge them once you are within their reach. This turret carries a pair of lasers and can swivel almost instantly to fire on new targets as they approach. Laser Turrets are especially useful when mounted on slow-moving freighters to fend off packs of small pirate vessels."

	description "For ships with enough space to install one, the Heavy Laser Turret is a powerful weapon, equally useful for driving off fighters and for bombarding larger targets with continuous fire without having to worry about pointing your ship in the right direction."

		"shield damage" 9.6
		"hull damage" 6
	description "A Blaster Turret is a pair of Energy Blasters mounted on a rotating platform, allowing it to fire in any direction. Modern software allows the turret to correct for a target's motion, making the Blaster Turret effective even against small, quickly moving fighters. Because it needs a special mounting point with a 360 degree field of view, not all ships are capable of being equipped with a turret."

		"shield damage" 9.6
		"hull damage" 6
	description "A Quad Blaster Turret carries four guns on a single turret mount, doubling the firepower of an ordinary Blaster Turret for ships with enough space to install one and energy to drive it. The Quad Blaster Turret is a relatively new invention that is quite popular among the captains of heavy freighters due to its superior firepower."

	description "At the same time that Betelgeuse was developing an anit-missile turret, the Deep was, too. The Heavy Anti-Missile turret has a longer range, higher power, and shorter reload time than its smaller counterpart. Unfortunately, it also requires more space and energy."

		"shield damage" 48
		"hull damage" 26
		"hit force" 50
		"missile strength" 3
	description "The Javelin Pod fires a rapid stream of unguided missiles. A Javelin Pod does far more damage than any gun of a comparable size, and has a longer range as well, but once a ship has expended all of its ammunition it must leave combat and find a planet where it can buy more, which makes Javelins less useful in protracted battles."
	description "	The weapon's high rate of fire also makes it useful for saturating well-protected ships' anti-missile defenses so that more dangerous projectiles fired by allied ships can sneak through."

	description "The Meteor Missile is the cheapest and simplest homing weapon available in human space. Meteors are quickly destroyed by the new government-funded anti-missile systems, and their infrared tracking systems have trouble homing in on targets with low heat levels. Nevertheless, their large warheads can spell doom for poorly-defended targets when the missiles are fired in great numbers."

	description "The Sidewinder Missile is a brand-new experimental model by a company who also worked on Betelgeuse's anti-missile defenses."
	description "	Although not as powerful or cheap as the popular Meteor missiles, the new Sidewinders have several advantages, including their superior maneuverability, better tracking systems, and protective casings that make them much harder for anti-missile systems to destroy."

	description "Torpedoes are by far the heaviest missile in human space, but many ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."

	description "With a powerful enough generator, many ships do not need batteries at all. The one exception is projectile weapons, which usually require a burst of energy far exceeding what the generator produces.

	description "This battery pack has more than twice the energy capacity of the most basic model, allowing your ship to engage in combat for longer periods of time before running out of energy. Some pilots have even been known to install these in lieu of any generator at all, trusting that they can reach their destination planet and recharge before running out of battery power, but that is a risky proposition."

Although it is possible for a ship to have no shield generator at all, recharging its shield matrix only when landed in a hospitable spaceport, life in deep space is unpredictable enough that most pilots find shield generators to be well worth the space they take up."

Although you can install more than one ramscoop, additional ramscoops on a single ship are not as effective as the first."
