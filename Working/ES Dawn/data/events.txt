		description `	From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren, but the planet appears to be a good source for raw materials and may one day become a thriving mining world. Currently, however, it is infested by pirates.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is built into the walls of a canyon which has been blasted out to create trenches that are hundreds of meters wide and deep, a network of flight lanes that are well marked out with lights and beacons. Behind the docking caves is a bustling subterranean city where bare rock and gleaming metal have been woven together in an architecture that is both functional and elegant. The lighting in the caverns varies over the course of the day to match the sunlight outside.`

		description `Thule is a mountainous world that was colonized about a hundred years ago. While other colonies established at that time have faded into nonexistence, Thule has flourished. There is an unusal culture here, and the people around you seem very suspicious of you.`
		spaceport `You have heard rumours that Thule is involved in piracy. Looking at the ships beside yours in the spaceport, the rumours seem more than likely to be true: there are a surprising number of warships parked here, many of which are badly damaged. Leaving your ship behind, you notice that many of those around you are heavily armed, and you even see someone wearing full tactical combat armour who appears to be nothing more than a merchant.`

		description `Millions of years ago, this was a warm world, perhaps even tropical. But some cataclysmic event, perhaps a meteor strike or a massive volcanic eruption, altered the planet's atmosphere enough to turn it into the nearly lifeless, frozen planet it is today.`
		description `	The first settlers came here to drill for the oil trapped deep under the surface, a relic of Tundra's former, more lively days. Instead of refining the oil into plastic, which sells relatively cheap in this region, many of them have become pirates, not out of choice, but out of necessity. The only other possible industry for them would be textiles, but the lack the equipment for such an industry.`

		description `Cornucopia is a world very suitable for agriculture. It is also a very newly-colonized world, full of hope and the attitude of independence that appears to infuse all worlds of its kind.`
		description `	From orbit, most of the landmass seems covered with a bizarre pixelated pattern. On approach, this resolves into a vast patchwork of fields and irrigation circles.`
		spaceport `The spaceport on Cornucopia is a set of massive hangars in the center of a wide-open plain. Before leaving your ship you had to sign several documents regarding the use and disposal of various chemicals used in ship operations, and the department of agriculture requires that any luggage you bring on or off world be submitted to a scan for biological material.`
		spaceport `	When you leave your hangar, you find yourself in an immense farmers' market, with hundreds of fruits and grains that you do not even know words for. The smell of this world is rich and earthy - you feel like you could almost receive all the nourishment your body needs just by breathing this air.`
