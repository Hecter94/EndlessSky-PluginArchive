### space.fauna
<br>
<br>
Adds space fauna fleets to all systems. Useless but pretty, to make the universe more alive.<br>
<br>
There are 14 different organisms, 1 titan-sized, 3 superheavy-sized, 4 heavy-sized, 6 medium-sized. They are coming in fleet sized from 1 to 5 and aren't capturable/plunderable. There are 4 Hive planets around the galaxy, with increased spawn rates and a "queen". Uninhabited systems have a higher spawn chance than inhabited systems.<br>
