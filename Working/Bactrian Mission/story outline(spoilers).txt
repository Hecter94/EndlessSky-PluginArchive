Start after Human civil war ends. Source in the deep. 
At Valhalla meet source. Basically I was between a time travelling wormhole (populate a whole 1/4 of the galaxy) or something like I did, which was a rich person paying for the pilot to find lost blueprints for the ship.
There are two paths the pilot can take (a third if reputation = Pirate >0), searching the library or getting involved with high tech pirates. Depending on the conversation choices you take you can collect the blueprints for another ship to be turned in at the end of the mission string. Both paths lead to Featherweight, which then leads back to Valhalla to turn in the bactrian blueprints/schematics.
