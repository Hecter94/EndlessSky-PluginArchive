	description “The first of a select few city-ships built by Lionheart Industries for colonization during the early days of colonization/what century was that?/. The Crataegus was used solely for initial colony development as it was dismantled upon arrival and its systems were used to jumpstart the colonies power and manufacturing abilities.”

	description "This Lionheart city-ship was designed for colonist transport to supplement existing colonies and help boost the population. Its focus as a civilian transport meant the Crataegus had less firepower than its sister ship, the Bactrian. Slight modifications on the original design allowed for reductions in the crew size by automation of the more rudimentary processes. Revitalizing this Lionheart classic has been difficult, though due to its sheer size it ought to find some application as trans-galactic casinoes"

	description "The Lionheart Bactrian is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance. Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is not normally for sale to ordinary citizens who have not been vetted by the local government of the Deep."
