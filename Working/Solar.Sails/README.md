### Solar Sails ###

**Author: [TheronEpic](https://github.com/TheronEpic)**

**Thanks:** Kitteh

An overhaul and re-publication of TheronEpic's [Solar Sails](https://github.com/TheronEpic/theronepic-solar-sails). Since the last update of the plugin in October 2020 there have been made massive changes in ES considering engines, so a stat overhaul was overdue. Also various syntax bugs had to be hunted down.

It seems, that TheronEpic could not complete the work on this plugin, so future updates of this re-publication will fill some gaps, e.g. considering fleets and variants.

One major change made, proposed by **Kitteh**, was to switch from reflective to diffractive solar sails. Therefore the sails, besides providing thrust and turn, also generate energy. However, reverse thrust as introduced by the original, was removed because of a lack of explainability.
