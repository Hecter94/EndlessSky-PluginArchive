### Solar Sails ###

**Author: [TheronEpic](https://github.com/TheronEpic)**

**Thanks:** Kitteh

An overhaul and re-publication of TheronEpic's [Solar Sails](https://github.com/TheronEpic/theronepic-solar-sails). Since the last update of the plugin in October 2020 there have been made massive changes in ES considering engines, so a stat overhaul was overdue. Also various syntax bugs had to be hunted down, and some gaps have been filled, e.g. considering variants, as seemingly TheronEpic could not complete the work on this plugin.

One major change made, proposed by **Kitteh**, was to switch from reflective to diffractive solar sails. Therefore the sails, besides providing thrust and turn, also generate energy. However, reverse thrust as introduced by the original, was removed because of a lack of explainability.

This plugins replaces the sales of Shuttle, Heavy Shuttle, Bounder, Arrow, Hogshead, Star Queen, Star Barge, Freighter and Sunder with sail variants, superior to the vanilla versions. Also removes the shipyard "Basic Ships" from every planet with "Betelgeuse Basics" and/or "Syndicate Basics" shipyards.
