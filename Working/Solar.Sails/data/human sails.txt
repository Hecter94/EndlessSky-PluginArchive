	description `Reflective and then diffractive solar sails were first devised in the earliest days of stellar exploration during the 20th-21st centuries, as a way to "sail" through space for long periods without needing to install engines or fuel. Diffractive sails like these also serve as a solar cell.`

	description `This is the largest solar sail available in known space. It looks ridiculous on anything smaller than a medium warship, letting you be seen from hundreds of kilometers away, but it does its job.`
	description `	If it were not for a series of cameras mounted on various structural parts of this sail, most ships' view would be significantly blocked.`
