	description `The Coalition has continued the development of diffractive solar sails. Though working according the same principles as those in Human space, they are significantly more efficient, from the featherweight materials to the better diffraction, and its less draining steering motors.`

	description `For the largest ships in the Coalition, the huge solar drive is as popular as stacking Large Thrust and Large Steering Modules.`
	description `	It's always a spectacle when a ship using Solar Drives prepares to dock on a station or to land on a planet. The sails are folded and retracted, and tugdrones are deployed to guide the ship to its anchorage.`
