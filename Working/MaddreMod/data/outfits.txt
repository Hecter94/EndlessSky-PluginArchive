	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."
