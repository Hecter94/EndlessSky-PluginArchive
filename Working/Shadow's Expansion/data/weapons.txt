	description "This technological wonder was retrieved from an abandoned research station in Alpha Centauri. It appears to add and subtract protons and neutrons from a ship's hyperspace fuel to 'fabricate' and launch a meteor missile. Scientists have found a way to reproduce the weapon, but nobody knows how it works."
	description "The weapon itself fires Meteor missiles at a slower rate than a normal launcher, and consumes a decent amount of energy in the process. In addition, it also uses a small amount of Hyperspace fuel. However, the weapon is capable of firing with no ammunition."
