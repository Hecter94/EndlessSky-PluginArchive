1.1.1: Added a shipyard to Trinket selling bare-bones versions of the Fury, Sparrow, and Modified Argosy.

1.1: Added the bare bones shuttle for the sake of being thorough. Added an event which makes new bare bones versions of very small ships available with the X1050 Ion Engines which become available when said engines do.

Removed the Finch's battery pack, which was left in by mistake; all bare-bones fighters have a solar cell to help them re-dock (very, very slowly) & prevent you from failing the flight check, but nothing else since they're presumably being carried in something more robust.

Further stripped the cargo-expansion Boxwing variant to reduce its price & re-wrote its description.

Alphebatized some stuff.

1.1 Modder's Addendum: If you're not a modder you can stop reading here. This is at same time as the Barb: the Southern Carriers 1 hidden event triggers 90 days after Initial Deployment 3 hidden event (29 8 3014).

Added a variant surveillance drone with significantly more scanning power by replacing the stock X1200/X1700 ion engines with an X1050. Escorts can't scan stuff as things stand, so it's mostly there as a modder's resource to insert into NPC fleets. The code is in bardagh-variants-ships-alternative-loadouts.txt but is unimplemented in game.

1.0: Bare bones versions of every human ship but the Shuttle (didn't seem to be much point). Variant versions of the Boxwing (no power plant, supercapacitor, single solar cell, cargo expansion) and Dreadnought (stack core instead of original power system), both automatically introduced at the proper time.
