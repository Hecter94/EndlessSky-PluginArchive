A plugin which adds variants of human ships to select shipyards. No stat changes, just loadouts. Right now it's mostly bare-bones versions so you don't have to pay for a bunch of outfits you're just going to sell - instead you get a (very) cheap engine & power system, a hyperdrive, & signature equipment like luxury accommodations for Star Liners.

Also adds a shipyard to Trinket which sells bare-bones Furies, Sparrows, & Modified Argosies.

I'll make a full list of outfit loadouts up if there's enough interest. This is my first plugin, so I wasn't documenting as I went.
