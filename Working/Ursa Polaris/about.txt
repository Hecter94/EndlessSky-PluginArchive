This plugin contains missions for your pilot to create a centrally located outfitter space station that stocks outfits from across the galaxy, and unlock all outfits made available through the Free Worlds plot, regardless of your arc choices (which will almost always preclude you from at least one). it additionally offers a few new end-game outfits with interesting balance points (that are quite effective). In all seriousness, though - balance was my primary focus - this is not a cheat mod, and an outfitter with all the outfits should cost what it does (or possibly more. this may change in the near future, as economic balances are applied within E.S.)
