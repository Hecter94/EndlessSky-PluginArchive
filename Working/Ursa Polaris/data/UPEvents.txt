event "Hope Springs Eternal"

		attributes uninhabited
		spaceport	`The spaceport here is little more than a few ships parked on a glacier, with one (near the middle) advertising bar services in a cargo hold, which they've dubbed "Fontes Aeternum."  Everyone inside is still wearing thermal gear, as the hold is not very well heated and non-alcoholic beverages have a habit of freezing if left unattended.  Otherwise, high top tables with stools and a few empty cups litter the hold, while the bar itself appears little more than a few vending machines with menu screens.  The venue seems to be generally serving more as a rendez-vous than a social club, with patrons generally leaving upon someone else's arrival (with them.)  Of course, if you're short on fuel, a few captains will pitch in and gets you topped up to get you where you're going.`

		description `Ursa Polaris Station is the result of agglomerating numerous asteroids from nearby systems, and mining/building them into a space station.  It is also the headquarters of the outfit and weapon developer of the same name.  The corporation mostly got its start as a 'big box' one stop shop for outfits from across human space, and quickly evolved to producing a few of their own outfits.  Their 'R&D lab' is actually a small fleet nearly always found in the system.  Occasionally pirates attempt to steal their prototypes, but only end up becoming a test subject for their latest developments.`
		spaceport `During construction, several shuttles were used to transport the asteroids to this system.  As construction progressed, most shuttle components were incorporated into the station.  The ownership of one of the shuttles was traced back and turned out to have been one of the station founders' first ship, so "Gallileo" remains apparently intact and flying garish electric green and orange colours in the atrium area of the station.`
