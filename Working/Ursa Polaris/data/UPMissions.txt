It's an acquired taste that James apparently has, and while your initial reaction is nearly spitting it out (in fact, a dribble makes its way to your chin before you discreetly wipe it), by the end of the first glass, you could imagine yourself sipping the stuff in your own retirement.

James turns to you and says "I bet you're wondering what those 'great things' I mentioned back on Farpoint are." You nod, he continues. "Back in my youth, I helped quite a few corporations test outfits while they were deciding whether and when to roll them out.  In the process, I met a great deal of the brightest minds in the industry, in spite of them being on opposite ends of the galaxy.  Anyhow, the biggest pain in my neck back in those days was traipsing across the galaxy two or three times just to get a new ship outfitted with the latest that those minds could come up with."  You sense that there's a revelation coming... "I always wanted to find someplace where I could get all the parts I needed, and I wasn't ready to settle down for any length of time to run and maintain a 'fitter of my own.

"Well, we have a crack group of engineers already working aboard Honest Abe.  I helped them remove all the fancy stuff that I'd been collecting back in the day.  Mostly stuff that was mothballed because the business folk didn't want invest in making them more viable, but there was some other stuff in there, too.  It's all aboard Honest Abe now, either being reverse engineered, improved, or loaded up for use.  The Marius was a sweet ship, though...To her!"  You meet his toast.  "Honest Abe is a good ship, and better serves our purposes..." he continues "which I imagine you're beginning to question, since we've talked about opening a top-tier outfitters, and spent a fair bit apparently recruiting weapons engineers.

As you may have guessed, we are planning to agglomerate some asteroids in Wei, and then mine and build them into a space station with the equipment you're about to retrieve from our contact.  We'll eventually receive Republic subsidy to monitor Hope, which will help offset the tariffs we'll incur when the outfitter is up and running.

You go through the routine of security check on boarding, and after stripping your thermal gear, you are directed to James' cabin where you find him using a portable terminal in a comfortable chair with a glass of Prag'ga wine on a table next to him.  The cabin is spare, but appears comfortable.  "There you are!" he says, rising.  He directs you to a wheeled chair near a desk and continues.`

Fortunately, Delta V is close by and has recently developed a serious power plant - and I happen to know a couple of the people who were in the finance aspect of that project.  I contacted them, told them about our station, and they agreed to subsidise our purchase of components needed to build several of their new reactor cores.  As a bonus, they talked some of their contacts at Southbound into throwing in some ships to carry the components back here, and even painted them in Ursa Polaris colours!`

You see an officer in a neat uniform march up the deck with a tablet in her hand and a warm smile on her face.  As she approaches you can see that her uniform, and the uniforms of the rest of the workers almost look like Republic Navy uniforms, except that they're a lighter shade and where you would normally see decorations or medals is just a simple, plastic name tag.  Her's reads "Lt. Espinosa".  She presents you with the tablet.`

The light on the side turns green as you and the lieutenant approach, and it's just a short ride up the very smoothly operating elevator to the executive offices.  You walk through a quiet, carpeted office towards a set of heavy, mahogany double doors.  Lieutenant Espinosa opens the door and waves you inside.`
			`The executive meeting room is nice, but simple.  Just a large mahogany table surrounded by leather chairs, white walls, and a standard vid-presentation display built into the wall behind the middle-aged man sitting at the head of the table.

When your partner contacted us about this deal, we agreed to it somewhat reluctantly because while this is a lucrative deal, we're nervous about sending large shipments of fissionable materials and armaments into.. less secure regions of space."`
			`He attempts to adjust his tie as well as his grimace before he continues.`
			`	"And being a new startup, you're somewhat of an unknown factor. We have no assurances that you won't sell our goods to pirates or simply 'lose' these commodities during transport.

			`	Albino Bruin's crew indicates that there was a flash of light and a powerful explosion as they were initiating their jump in Wei.  When they arrived in Holeb, they were disabled, their radio and half of their other systems were fried, and the White Kodiak was not visible.`
			`	James thanks the Albino Bruin crew, and instructs them to get to medical for a once-over.`
			`	Malcolm, who has been pale and silent until now, speaks up, "I'd like to see what sensor data our crew can retrieve from the Albino Bruin, but it sounds like we may not be able to get the Polar Core to make unlinked hyperspace jumps."`
			choice
				`	"Polar Core?"`
			`	Malcolm seems almost surprised you hand't heard about it.  "We've managed to create and contain some dark matter.  Artificial gravity systems and our Inertial Dampers were key components, but the last piece of the puzzle came in the White Sun Reactor."`
			`	He continues, "It's enormous" he boasts, "We have to land most ships we're putting one into on Hope to move all the other outfits around so that there's room for it.`
			`	Besides getting it to generate lots of power and even store some of it while generating next to no heat, we've managed to get it to do a few other tricks.  For starters, we got it to move the ship - not much, but a little nudge, and it doesn't take up engine capacity.  Then we got it to act like a navigational deflector, increasing the ship's maximum speed.  We even got it to make hyperspace jumps with a little speed along links, but you've seen the effects of our latest attempt to make it jump without a link.`
			choice
				`	"Sounds amazing - when can I get my hands on one?"`
			`	Malcolm quirks his eyebrow, "There are risks.  The containment field must be harmonized to the ship's defensive shields, which adds some strength to them but," he pauses to look at James "the containment field is dependent on harmonic resonance from the the ship's defensive shields, and when they fail, the dark matter containment field becomes highly unstable, and the hull begins experiencing catastrophic stresses.  It happens extremely quickly - we lost a Mule in less than two seconds, when a pirate Leviathan jumped in on an early shipboard test.  I think I would have liked to have seen the look on that pirate's face when the hull collapsed faster than he could take his finger off the heavy laser firing button."`
			`	James points out, "If we don't locate the White Kodiak, it makes 29 souls lost on this project, Malcolm.  I'm glad it's finished."  Malcolm winces a little.  You suspect he wanted to tinker with the Polar Core some more to see what else he could get it to do.  "On the flip side of the coin," James continues, "if a boarding mission goes south, and you are outnumbered, you could always take cover around it on the defense - attackers aren't likely to take risks with firearms or explosives when you tell them what will happen if the core breaches."`
			`	Malcolm snickers a little "I guess when you have nothing left to lose, it's an option.  Still want one, Captain <last>?`
			choice
				`	"I'd at least like to check one out."`

For a while, I just assumed that she was way out there, beyond contact, but as years passed, then decades, I came to believe that she met an unfortunate end."`
