	description "Hyper Ionized Plasma, or H.I.P., Cannons pack a wallop for captains at both ends of the barrel. Designed to be capital ships' medium range heavy artillery, this devastating device hyper-ionizes, super heats, and accelerates globs of hyperdrive fuel with horrific effects. Ships struck by the primary projectile suffer crippling heat load, massive damage, and interruption to their shielding and power systems. Things do not get terribly better for the captain firing these doom cannons: set aside tonnage to generate lots of power, cooling, and fuel…this much firepower comes with ancillary costs."

	description "The RFP weapon is a next step in Plasma Cannon technology. An integrated super-preheater keeps some plasma ready-to-fire, but puts a strain on your ship's power and cooling systems, even when not shooting. When the shooting does start, ships power and cooling systems are subject to a torture test of the sort that engineers have nightmares (or fantasies) about. Most ships can manage a crippling volley, but sustained fire is nearly impossible except on the heaviest of warships."

	description "Calling this projectile a 'slug' hardly does it justice. A quantum flux generator dramatically reduces the effective mass of this mostly depleted nuclear fuel bolt during acceleration, and returns greater mass once adrift. The half-ton slug itself begins to deteriorate shortly after launch, from impacts with ordinary space dust, coupled with molecular instability caused by the quantum flux generator. The more intact the slug upon impact, the more mass the quantum flux generator has to work with on the rubber-band, i.e. damage and impact force deteriorate with range. Large enough fragments retain residual quantum flux, so they show up on radar until they're almost dust."

	description "The Mass Driver uses a shot of hyperdrive fuel and a substantial spark to begin IBS acceleration, which then continues through a series of superconducting helical electromagnets to muzzle velocity. Ships caught at point-blank range are treated to overheated systems and a significant push from the hyper-accelerated combusting hyperdrive fuel muzzle flare…and then the fully intact IBS. The weapon mostly shields the hull from damaging quantum flux, but as a side effect, acts like it's far more massive when installed on a ship. Make no mistake: this is long range support artillery, and ships carrying many of this weapon will require escort support."

The robot maintenance stations occupy quarters that crew would have formerly used, rather than valuable tonnage. The robots are equipped with boarding suppression equipment which functions as long as there's crew to rearm them, but they cannot leave the ship. Finally, S.A.R.C. depends on the ship's shield regenerators as its communications routers, and will improve their efficiency when installed."

	description "Ursa Polaris' crowning outfit uses inertial damping and artificial gravity to contain and manipulate a mass of dark matter with varying results; immense power generation, floating hyperdrive, minor thrust, navigational deflector, and a bit power storage - with very low heat footprint. Of course, actually producing and manipulating dark matter is not without expense, which is reflected in the price point. Note: The dark matter containment field of the Polar Core resonates with your ship's defensive shields, boosting their total capacity. WARNING: THE ABSENCE OF DEFENSIVE SHIELD HARMONICS WILL DESTABILIZE DARK MATTER CONTAINMENT. Unchecked dark matter containment failure results in catastrophic hull integrity collapse. Ship owners equip this outfit at their own risk."
