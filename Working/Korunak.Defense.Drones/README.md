An overhaul and republication of the [Defense Drone Plugin](https://github.com/starmlerp/ESDefenseDronePlugin), with consideration of the corresponding ES PRs [#5071](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5071) and [#5417](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/5417).

Being distributed over a plugin and two PRs from May to October 2020, Starmlerp's idea has never been  consolidated into a whole. Nevertheless there's even a serious modern plugin, [RW Ships](https://www.moddb.com/mods/rw-ships) which takes the original plugin into account. It was time to modernize the stats, bring everything together, and round off.

Korunak Robotics is a sister company of Korunak Photovoltaics. Except of houshold drones of any kind like the Vroomba or the Sheepomotion, it also became well-known for its space combat drones. Popular among merchants, the [classified] became interested to [paragraph classified]. Therefore, [2 pages classified], so finally [10 pages classified].

The basic *Defense Drone* is available from the beginning, the *Nock* in-war, the *Super Nock* post-war. Further, the plugin brings a drone-carrying modification of the Freighter and involves [classified].
