	description "Once the Navy began building cruisers, the demand for a civilian ship that can carry drones quickly became apparent. The Syndicate quickly answered this newly arisen interest in drones with a corresponding carrier modification of the Freighter. Besides having a stronger hull and more weapon space than the standard model, it can also carry a pair of drones, which the captain can choose to sacrifice in order to give the fleet more time to escape the pirates."

	description `The Class Q "Freighter" is a stealth warship designed by the Syndicate for baiting pirates with the offer of what appears to be a helpless, ordinary Container Transport.`
	description `	Inside, a layer of Interference Plating hides its military-grade equipment and a dozen combat drones secreted away in its converted cargo containers, while its faux gearing conceals extra shield emitters.`
