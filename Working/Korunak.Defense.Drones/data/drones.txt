	description "The Korunak Robotics Defense Drone series is almost as old as space exploration itself. The first models were used as surveillance probes in the Sol system, and later as reconnaissance drones when the first colonies were established. They were repurposed as expendable freighter defense vessels during the Alpha wars, and the main design hasn't changed much since."
	description "	Drones do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a drone unless you have a ship in your fleet with a drone bay."

	description "Korunak Robotics released the Nock shortly after Syndicated Shipyards its Barb fighter, although its development began almost a decade earlier. It's the first human drone with a shield matrix, making a step away from seeing drones as expendables. For a higher price one gets more sustainability, and saves money in the long-term."

	description "Korunak Robotics' Super Nock drone is at eye level with any fighter sold, at that saving the costs for a life support system and the wages for a pilot."
