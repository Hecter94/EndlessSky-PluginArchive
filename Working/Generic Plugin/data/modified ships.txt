	description "Southbound Shipyard's very own Light Warship, the Cleaver, is very similar to their Clipper in design. The main differences is dropping the two heavy pods on either side of the craft, making it lighter and more maneuverable. Next, the addition of a turret mount on the top, in exchange for a few bunks. And finally, a much-needed paint job update."
