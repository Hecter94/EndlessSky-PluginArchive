# All-Content Plugin
This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.

# Contributing
This plugin is meant to mirror the most recent official release of [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), rather than its most recent "continuous build," and as such should be usuable to those who use Steam or PPAs as the source of their game version. As such, PRs are welcome following new additions during an ES release cycle, but depending on the scope of the contribution, may not be merged promptly.
