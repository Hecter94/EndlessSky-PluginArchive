	landscape land/water4
	description `This moon is covered in a freshwater ocean, kept liquid by tidal forces from the gas giant it orbits. Rikuzari provides the drinking water for many of the more arid Shirni worlds, which is transported in specially modified freighters.`
	spaceport `Your ship is extensively decontaminated in midair over the polar icecap before you are allowed to land. Once you land, your cargo and outfits are put through a similar procedure, as are you the moment you step off your ship. It seems the Shirni want to minimise the chance of alien pathogens entering their water supply.`
	spaceport ` The spaceport facilities are fairly rudimentary apart from the massive pumps for loading water onto ships. Evidently this moon is not expected to recieve many visitors.`

planet Roturika
	attributes "requires: gaslining"
	landscape land/nasa20
	description `Roturika's atmosphere is wracked by constant hurricane-force winds and lightning storms. Occasionally, the Shirni send probes to attempt to determine the nature of the core, but even after over a milennium of technological progress not one of their probes has survived long enough to reach it.`

planet Shibirni
	attributes shirni urban
	landscape land/city1
	description `Shibirni was the first planet the Shirni reached outside their home system. The urban areas are all planned, with large skyscrapers abruptly giving way to idyllic countryside and streets forming a triangular grid.`
	spaceport `There are two spaceports on this planet. The first is relatively small for the planet's population, having been designed when the planet was originally settled. The second is huge, easily as large as some cities in human space.`

planet Shipoderni
	attributes shirni urban
	landscape land/city12
	description `This is the homeworld of the Shirni, an unusually large moon orbiting a gas giant in this system's habitable zone. The population is slightly more than that of earth, but due to the Shirni's small size the extent of the urban regions is lesser.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is an odd mixture of several quite different architectures. Many of the older buildings have sharp triangular shapes and appear to be made of a concrete-like material.`

planet Tazarna
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/beach2
	description `The primary industry on Tazarna is the farming of a species of rapidly growing kelp-like algae. Most fabrics in use in Shirni space are made from processed algal fibres farmed on this planet, as are some construction materials.`
	spaceport `The docks for the massive cargo ships ferrying huge loads of kelp are situated as close to the spaceport as possible, to maximise the efficiency of the loading and unloading processes. There are large teams of Shirni whose jobs appear to consist entirely of hosing down the floors with a chemical that serves both as a cleaning fluid and as a form of odour control.`

planet Tladeriza
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/lava5
	description `Tladeriza was the first attempt the Shirni made at terraforming. Normally, a planet this far from its sun would be frozen and uninhabitable. The Shirni decided to rectify this by stripping off the upper sections of the planet's crust, bringing the surface closer to the molten mantle. While the planet's surface is now at a pleasant temperature, it is also wracked by near-constant earthquakes and frequent volcanic eruptions.`
	description `	The only permanent settlements here are small research stations working on developing earthquake warning systems to be used elsewhere. They are all built in flattened pyramidal shapes and from flexible, rubbery materials.`
		
planet Ubirata
	attributes shirni
	landscape land/bwerner7
	description `The settlements on this moon include a large number of hospitals, serving as a medical centre for all of Shirni space. While each planet has enough medical facilities for its own population, this planet would be used in the event of a major outbreak of disease.` 
	spaceport `The spaceport is huge and almost entirely empty, having been designed to be able to accommodate huge numbers of Shirni.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is sleek and modern, with smooth, reflective walls illuminated by blueish light. There is a second spaceport on the other side of the planet which is restricted to only those involved directly with cutting-edge research projects.`

	description `Xidera is a cold, wet farming world where the Shirni grow a species of edible fungus that forms the basis of much of their diet. The sun is perpetually obscured by clouds, and days without precipitation are almost unheard of.`
	spaceport `The spaceport dwarfs every other urban region on this planet - this city easily holds more than two thirds of the planet's entire population. The spaceport has an extensive drainage system, to prevent the heavy rainfall from causing flooding.`

planet Ziderali
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/snow9
	description `Ziderali is home to the remains of the first colony created by the Shirni outside their home planet. This tiny moon has no atmosphere, so the colony consisted entirely of small pressurised domes which were abandoned shortly after the Shirni began colonising other more habitable planets.`

planet Zokaderi
	attributes shirni military
	landscape land/sea5
	description `Zokaderi is the main base of the Shirni military. There are no major landmasses on the planet, so starships are built and equipped on enormous floating cities the size of an island. Some of these floating cities are covered by thick transparent domes and built to be able to submerge, in case the planet is attacked.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is busy, as the crew of the huge number of ships stationed here pick up food in the many restaurants and cafes. The tables are built with a modular design, so that larger tables can be easily assembled to seat the crew of even the largest ships.`
