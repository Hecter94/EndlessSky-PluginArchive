You enter, noticing that unlike some other Shirni buildings the hallways are sufficiently wide and tall that both you and the Quarg with you can walk upright.`

Rows of seats along both sides are full of Shirni in what you presume must be their equivalent to fine suits; long blue-green fleeces that cover their arms and legs.

The Quarg interpreter looks down and begins typing on another of the Shirni messaging devices, and after a few seconds you recieve a message entirely in your language explaining that Votari is being questioned on the capabilities of the ships that attacked you.
