Planetary map travelling concept : Land on Memory, visit the outfitter and follow the small story line.<br>
<br>
This is just a proof of concept of an idea by Epsil-Astra.<br>
Basically a planet in a starsystem is a wormhole to a starsystem with changed background, to look like a ground map. The planets there look like cities. The galaxy background is a single whole planet. It simulates travelling on a planet you've landed on. Other starsystems act as different bioms, like forest, desert, sea.<br>
A small storyline got added.<br>
