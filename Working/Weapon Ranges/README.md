# Weapon-Ranges
Roughly double weapon ranges for all non-homing, non-beam weapons.

Most small, fast projectiles have this weighted as higher velocity, while most big, slow projectiles have this weighted as longer lifetime.

Adds cluster and parallel to most longer ranged weapons.

Includes blaster changes to turn them into more of an anti-fighter screen, but I'm only 84% satisfied with that atm.
