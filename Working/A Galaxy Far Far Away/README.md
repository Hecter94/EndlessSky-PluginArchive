# Endless-Sky-(A-Galaxy-Far-Far-Away)
Just a plugin that I made that aims to replicate Star Wars (or at least tries to) in Endless Sky. During the past year or so, I've managed to create around 280 ships, ranging from one-man fighters to capital ships, all from a variety of eras and factions (The Old Republic, the Republic & CIS, the Empire & Rebels, the First Order & Resistance, and even some from Legends). Currently, there is no existing storyline or a functioning galaxy map, though I intend to finish another 100 ships before I develop other aspects of the plugin (their sprites can be found in the plugin already).

### An important note:
I really don't know if this project will ever be completed (it's not a high priority for me), but I thought I might as well make it available for other people. If anybody would like to update the plugin for themselves, please feel free! I have no idea how Github works, so maybe duplicate the plugin into your own repositories so that I don't have to deal with any of the "pull request" stuff.

Currently, the plugin is unbalanced, buggy and overall frustrating at times, and I honestly don't know if any of these issues will ever be solved. (also please don't bombard me with questions)

## Notes:
The "images/ship" folder contains many ships that have been yet to be added to the plugin. If you wish to add them to the game, follow the steps below:
1) Scale the png. file down to a size that is comparable to the rest of the other ships (just estimate)
2) Use the website (endless-sky.github.io/ship_builder.html) to place engines, turrets and guns.
   Use the "Show Collision Mask" to identify any semi-transparent pixels
3) Add the ship to the corresponding txt. file in the "data" folder, including the correct outfits and hardpoints.
   - For the description, copy & paste from the wookiepedia entry of the ship.
4) Add the ship name to the "data/sales" txt. file.
5) Finished!

Known Issues:
1) The particularly large ships occasionally seem to accelerate backwards after entering another system.
2) The particularly large ships have a collision box that prevents smaller ships directly above it from being hit by enemies.
3) The maximum number of turrets that a ship can have is 32, limiting the capital ships' abilities to fight.
4) The MG-100 Bombers are currently useless (the ship AI can't deploy the proton bombs properly due to their 0 acceleration).
5) Similar to vanilla Endless Sky, fighters can often be useless
6) I have created both "interceptor" and "fighter" versions of each starfighter so that some may be docked while some cannot.
    - "Fighter" versions do not have a hyperdrive, since this would crash the game (trust me, I tried)

Limitations:
1) The galaxy map is barely complete (only a few systems have been filled, though all of them have been created)
2) I didn't know whether to set the plugin in the Galactic Republic era, the Imperial era, or the New Republic/First Order era. (I added ships from all eras just in case –> including the Old Republic)
3) The outfits & weapons are currently just placeholders since I tried to standardise them just to make it easier for balancing.
4) I couldn't upload the ship designs of the "Assertor Star Dreadnought", the "Bellator Star Dreadnought" and the "Secutor Star Dreadnought", since their files exceeded Github's 25mb limit.
5) Missions are currently non-existent (though I have added a few simply for the purposes of making my video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0iwpfe96mc&feature=youtu.be)
6) Fleets are also essentially non-existent, though there are a couple around.
   - The fleets involving Star Destroyers currently have an absurd number of fighters that is impossible to fight against (though fits          Wookiepedia information)
7) I'm running out of things to say, but I'm sure some other problems will be discovered at some point.
