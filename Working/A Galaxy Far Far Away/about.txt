Just a plugin that I made that aims to replicate Star Wars (or at least tries to) in Endless Sky. During the past year or so, I've managed to create around 280 ships, ranging from one-man fighters to capital ships, all from a variety of eras and factions (The Old Republic, the Republic & CIS, the Empire & Rebels, the First Order & Resistance, and even some from Legends). Currently, there is no existing storyline or a functioning galaxy map, though I intend to finish another 100 ships before I develop other aspects of the plugin (their sprites can be found in the plugin already).
