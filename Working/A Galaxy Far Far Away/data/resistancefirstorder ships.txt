	description "The Viscount-class Star Defender was envisioned as the New Republic equivalent of an Executor-class Star Dreadnought. The first prototype was a 3 km long battlecruiser, and the full production model was a 17 km long dreadnought. Although slightly shorter in length than the Executor-class, the superior construction skills of the Mon Calamari have enabled the vessel to carry more starfighters, as well as having a substantially smaller crew. Its shape is also more compact than the Executor-class and it has heavier and more extensive armour. Dozens of docking clamps allow the vessel to directly dock with many other capital ships at the same time."
