	description "The CC-7700 frigate is a class of frigate used by the Imperial Navy, an updated version of the earlier Detainer CC-2200. The CC-7700 is an Interdictor vessel, due to its ability to emit an interdiction field, which prevents other ships from entering hyperspace and can be used to maroon vessels traveling at lightspeed. The CC-7700 is lightly armed and is not intended to act as a battleship. Instead, it is designed to be a platform for gravity well projectors with a mission profile similar to the Immobiliser 418 Cruiser."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "Though it shares a similar profile with its predecessor, the Nebulon-B2 differs in some key ways. The forward pod split into an inverted-V shape, allowing for greater surface area to mount weaponry. Furthermore, the connecting spar is heavier, rendering it less vulnerable to being split open by heavy fire. The ship is about 50 meters shorter overall."

	description "The MC80 Liberty type Star Cruiser is an early type of Mon Calamari Star Cruiser put into service for the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. Like most Mon Calamari designs, each vessel is individually unique, something that is frustrating for Rebel technicians. As with other Calamari designs during the Galactic Civil War, all warships in this group have been standardised as much as possible to aid non-Calamari crewmembers, something the artistic Mon Calamari have accepted begrudgingly."

Early rebel movements have adopted the fighter against the Galactic Empire, using them extensively during operations. Essentially a cockpit with two engines, the RZ-1 is so fast and manoeuvrable that it is a challenge to pilot even for even the most experienced pilots."
