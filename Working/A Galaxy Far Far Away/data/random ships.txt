Despite an early attempt at maintaining fleets of larger capital ships, like the venerable Bothan Assault Cruiser, the Bothan government opted in the aftermath of the Battle of Gilatter VIII to maintain a larger fleet of small, agile vessels. The result was the Tallani-built Bothan frigate, which was noted for heavier than normal armour plating and an impressive array of weaponry."

Derivative of the Lambda-class family, the JV-7 was designed to correct some weaknesses in the original Lambda design. The craft boasts a higher top speed, and manoeuvrability was also improved. It has 20% more shield power and a significantly stronger hull than the Lambda-class."

	description "The Dynamic-class freighter is a light freighter built by a subsidiary of Core Galaxy Systems on the remote Republic world of Transel around the period of the Mandalorian Wars. A stock Dynamic-class freighter was only modestly armed and shielded; however, the ship was designed to accept modifications without compromising existing systems and most ships were therefore heavily customised by their owners. Though prized for its ability to be modified with ease—a trait advertised by the class's name—Dynamic-class starships were rare throughout the galaxy as only one ship was produced at a time."

	description "The EF76 Nebulon-B escort frigate is a frigate manufactured by Kuat Drive Yards. Despite being intended for Imperial Navy service, it is more famous for its role as a Rebel Cruiser, used by the Alliance to Restore the Republic. Boasting a highly versatile design platform, the Nebulon-B frigate serves in a range of capacities, although is typically utilised as an escort frigate. The Rebel Alliance deploys these frigates to protect transport convoys from Imperial attacks or pirate raids, although some are modified for long-range scouting or search-and-rescue operations."

	description "The Cargo Empress-class super freighter is a 110-meter long ship built by Ghtroc Industries. The Cargo Empress was produced shortly after the introduction of the Class 720 freighter and was an attempt to capitalise on the smaller ship's modest success. However, the Cargo Empress sold poorly and was a major contributing factor to Ghtroc's bankruptcy. In a desperate attempt to pay off the company's debts, all remaining Cargo Empress-class ships were dumped on the market at very low prices. As a result, ships of the class can be found throughout the galaxy, despite their commercial failure."

	description "The Gravestone was a massive alien combat frigate that was able to defeat the Eternal Fleet, a fleet of droid-controlled warships that was systematically destroying all life within Wild Space, with its powerful Omnicannon. The Gravestone disappeared after the battle with the fleet, scuttled in the Endless Swamp of the planet Zakuul. Centuries later, it was discovered by the crew of the Outlander, who repaired the starship and used it to escape Zakuul. The Gravestone became the mobile base of the Outlander's group prior to the establishment of the Alliance on Odessen."

	description "The Cygnus Spaceworks Helot-class medium space transport is a transport that was designed in the time before the resurgence of the Empire. The ship had already declined in popularity by the end of the Yuuzhan Vong invasion of the galaxy. The ship was designed by engineers from both Cygnus Spaceworks and Sienar Fleet Systems, and was designed as an affordable ship. The Helot lacked shields and had low manoeuvrability, but was equipped with fire-linked laser cannons."

	description "The Inexpugnable-class tactical command ship was a large warship class used by the Republic Navy during the Mandalorian Wars. Designed and manufactured by Rendili Hyperworks and Rendili/Vanjervalis Drive Yards, the Inexpugnable-class was used as a flagship and command ship. Often described as a mobile space station, at 3,100 meters in diameter it was one of the largest Republic spacecraft of its time. The Inexpugnable-class was renowned for its ability to lead massive Republic fleets, employing advanced command techniques such as the Vanjervalis Chain to command up to sixty-four Hammerhead-class cruisers simultaneously. Despite its usefulness as a fleet flagship, the ship had several weaknesses, and as such, only six Inexpugnable-class ships were manufactured."

	description "The KT-400 military droid carrier was a light freighter, and a common sight throughout the galaxy both before and after the Jedi Civil War. Originally designed by Kellenech Technologies, a droid manufacturer, this ship was supposed to carry its military and construction droids. But when it bankrupted, the Galactic Republic took the design and began production of the ships through Republic Fleet Systems. However, after the Great Sith War the funding stopped and a variety of manufacturers was contracted to finish the vessels for military and commercial use."

	description "Purrgil are a species of massive, whale-like creatures that live in deep space, traveling from star system to star system. It is their natural ability to fly through hyperspace that inspired sentients to develop hyperdrive technology. However, most spacers consider purrgil to be pests due to their habit of approaching and flying into starships near their flight paths. Numerous spacer deaths can be attributed to purrgil-related incidents, leading most spacers to fire upon them on sight."

	description "The Pinook fighter is a starfighter manufactured by Joraan Drive Systems. Compared to other starfighters in service, the Pinook is underpowered, undergunned, poorly shielded, and inadequately armoured. A worse than average craft all around, its only favourable quality is its better-than-average manoeuvrability."

	description "The Liberator-class cruiser, also Liberator Cruiser, is a powerful frontline capital ship designed by the SoroSuub Corporation to combat piracy. Although slender and small in size, the cruiser boasts a formidable array of weaponry comprising more than four hundred combined turbolaser and ion cannon batteries, and can carry a complement of six starfighter squadrons and three troop regiments. Utilised by both the Sullustan Home Guard and the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War, the Liberator features cutting-edge armour plating, shielding, and drive unit technology, making it one of the galaxy's most advanced warships."

	description "The M12-L Kimogila heavy fighter is the heaviest in MandalMotors line of snubfighters. The M12 is used by the Hutt crime organisations to protect their 'interests' and are often crewed by mercenary pilots. Its numerous gun emplacements classify the ship as a heavy fighter, and its torpedo capabilities allow it to function as a bomber in special circumstances. This flexibility makes it quite popular among free mercenaries. Though it lacks the speed and manoeuvring capabilities of its predecessors, its ability to cause wanton slaughter may outweigh these factors."

	description "The M12-L Kimogila heavy fighter is the heaviest in MandalMotors line of snubfighters. The M12 is used by the Hutt crime organisations to protect their 'interests' and are often crewed by mercenary pilots. Its numerous gun emplacements classify the ship as a heavy fighter, and its torpedo capabilities allow it to function as a bomber in special circumstances. This flexibility makes it quite popular among free mercenaries. Though it lacks the speed and manoeuvring capabilities of its predecessors, its ability to cause wanton slaughter may outweigh these factors."

	description "The Ranger Gunboat is a rather uncommon ship most widely used as a patrol ships for smaller, less frequented hyperplanes. The vessel is capable of holding its own, not requiring the support of smaller patrol ships. The Ranger sometimes cleans hyperlanes from debris or smaller asteroids with its added tractor beam projector."

	description "The R60 T-wing interceptor was an interceptor originally designed to replace the A-wing. Unfortunately, the end result turned out to be a poor replacement for the craft.

With shield and hull strength similar to that of the Z-95 Headhunter, this craft would not last long if it was hit accurately by even a medium-power salvo."

	description "The Mesens Corporation SCT Scout Craft is a long range reconnaissance vessel, commonly used for deep space patrols on the far edges of planetary systems. The vessel's most notable feature, however, is its prominent sensor dish, located beneath the bridge. This is the key component that enabled the Scout Craft to fulfil its function admirably. The craft is not commonly seen, however this was probably due to the predominantly clandestine nature of their missions. Popular with various groups throughout the galaxy, the SCT scout craft is observed in the employ of both legitimate authorities and outlaw groups."

	description "The TYE-wing essentially combined the key weaknesses of both the TIE fighter and the Y-wing, yet had the strengths of neither. Many pilots dubbed them 'DIE-wings', because with combined low firepower and fragility of a TIE and the sluggishness and ungainliness of a Y-Wing, its battle performance, alongside its survivability, was almost non-existent."

	description "The Venator-class Destroyer, also known as the Republic attack cruiser, was one of the capital ships used extensively by the Galactic Republic during the later parts of the Clone Wars, as well as by the Galactic Empire. It was designed and constructed by Kuat Drive Yards and Allanteen Six shipyards. While designed primarily for ship-to-ship combat, the Venator had secondary roles ranging from starfighter carrier, to military transport and battleship escort. The expanded carrier role made the Venator-class popular amongst Jedi starfighter aces."

	description "The YG-4210, built by the Corellian Engineering Corporation, is considered to be an ancient ship model, first constructed more than two centuries prior to the Galactic Civil War, even predating the venrable YT-series by several decades. Designed specifically for space exploration rather than combat, the freighter was originally unarmed. However, after centuries of serving, most likely none of them match the original specifications. Weapons such as blasters, ion cannons and concussion missiles are common in these modified vehicles."
