	description "The Allegiance-class battlecruiser is similar in appearance to both the Victory, Procursator and Imperial-class Star Destroyers, but is larger than all of them, reaching a length of 2,200 meters. Unlike the Victory and the Imperial, the Allegiance-class lacks ventral hangar bays. Like fellow hangarless models such as the Procursator and Tector-class, the model seems to rely on its own exterior ordnance, as the Allegiance was unable to carry any starfighters or ground vehicles internally."

	description "The Arc Hammer is a factory ship of unique design. Like many other Imperial starships, the Arc Hammer has a long, narrow, dagger-shaped hull; however, it also has four large columns surrounding a central one that protruded from below and a small, flat bridge structure in front of the columns on its dorsal side."

	description "The Assertor-class Star Dreadnought is a class of Imperial Star Dreadnought. The Assertor-class Star Dreadnought is 15 kilometers long and has a hull-shape similar to the Executor-class Star Dreadnought, being primarily shaped like an arrowhead. It is considered the second largest of the standard Star Dreadnought line (with only the Executor-class being larger), as well as the largest in the Imperial Navy in a family that included the Mandator- and Bellator-class ships."

	description "The Bellator-class dreadnought was a warship in the Imperial Navy, as well as a divergent design in the Mandator-series of Star Dreadnought. During the class's service period, several Bellator-class dreadnoughts were known to have docked at Naval Station Validusia for refueling and maintenance alongside other heavy warships. In addition, ships of both this class and that of its cousin, the Mandator-class, often flanked the Assertor-class Star Dreadnought in fleet formations during the Galactic Civil War since prior to the Battle of Yavin, largely due to that ship's role as a sector command and control ship.

The Carrack-class is a cheap replacement for expensive capital ships and is not designed to operate as ships of the line, despite being capable of trading fire with larger adversaries. It remained in use by the Galactic Empire."

	description "The Imperial I-class Star Destroyer is perhaps the most iconic model in the service of the Imperial Navy. As a wedge-shaped capital ship, it is bristled with weapons emplacements, assault troops, boarding craft, and TIE line starfighters. Easily becoming the most recognisable symbol of Imperial power, the Imperial-class demonstrated its tactical versatility by protecting galactic commerce and bolstering Imperial-backed governments."

	description "The IPV-1 System Patrol Craft is a standard system security and customs vessel commonly used near planets to interdict smugglers and protect against piracy. Produced by Republic Sienar Systems, the craft is very fast and manoeuvrable for its size, patrolling Imperial sectors when larger ships are unavailable. They are regarded as the first line of defence against purveyors of contraband and various organisations attempting insurrection against a system, and rely on their speed to catch and disable or destroy enemy craft."

	description "The Vector-class Star Destroyer was a 1.6km-long dagger-shaped vessel, essentially a version of the contemporary Imperial-class, with ventral hangars absent. Instead of ventral hangar bays, the design opted for an increase in armour that covered the areas normally used as main hangar openings, as well as the reactor core. This made the design more efficient in ship-to-ship combat, as it had less access to internal weak-spots. However, it limited its usefulness in other roles, requiring dedicated carriers to provide any starfighter support."

The 150 meter-long corvette is used by the Galactic Empire to support the TIE fighters used to engage the fleet of the Alliance to Restore the Republic during the Galactic Civil War. Lira Wessex, chief designer of both the Venator-class and Imperial-class Star Destroyers, designed the Raider-class corvette to fill a tactical void the Empire had against the Rebel Alliance's starfighter-oriented strategies."

	description  "The Strike-class medium cruiser is a medium star cruiser designed by the Loronar Corporation during the Galactic Civil War for the Imperial Navy. As a general-purpose vessel capable of modular modifications, the vessel is suitable for many mission profiles, yet cheap enough to be produced in large quantities. A departure from the Navy's trend towards increasingly large warships, the Strike-class cruiser is an admission to diminished ability to defend space superiority against the Rebel Alliance and other forces as the conflict wore on."
