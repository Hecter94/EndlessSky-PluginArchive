	description  "The Class 546 Cruiser is a model of light cruiser that resembles an Arquitens-class command cruiser of the Galactic Empire. Although similar to the command cruiser model, the Class 546 houses a large internal hangar bay that can be accessed by port and starboard hangar doors and a launch tube at the centre of the vessel between the ship's two prongs. Its bridge is also different from the standard Arquitens-class model, and is equipped with three primary and four secondary sublight engines."

	description "The T-70 X-wing starfighter is the successor to the T-65B X-wing starfighter, manufactured by Incom-FreiTek for use by the New Republic Defence Fleet. Faster and more expensive and complex than the former T-65B, the T-70 features advanced weaponry. The design has proved to be more versatile than its predecessor, becoming essential in both dogfights and capital-ship scale combat operations."

	description "The RZ-2 A-wing interceptor is a wedge-shaped starfighter that began production by Kuat Systems Engineering after the success of the former RZ-1 A-wing interceptor used by the Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. The RZ-2 incorporates and standardises years of RZ-1 field modifications by the Rebellion, along with making the chassis slimmer and longer to yield even more speed. As such, piloting the ultra-fast yet temperamental starfighter is a matter of pride for various Resistance pilots regarding their skills and daring."

	description "The A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter, more commonly referred to as the B-wing, is a heavily armed Rebel Alliance single-pilot starfighter and bomber manufactured by Slayn & Korpil. The B-Wing is a relatively poor dogfighter, primarily designed as a 'blockade buster' to attack and destroy large capital ships. As such, it is equipped with weaponry and systems normally reserved for much larger craft. Indeed, the B-wing boasted more firepower than most patrol ships and corvettes."
