Makes gameplay more casual
- Ships are heavier making navigation and combat slower
- Higher range for some cannons to compensate ship speed
- Less, slower and weaker asteroids to increase clarity, FPS and easier mining


WIP:
- Modify asteroid count and speed in more star systems
- Add more bigger ships, currently only the falcon has twice the size with sprite taken from high-dpi mod

Limits:
- No game balancing has been done after the ship and weapon modifications
