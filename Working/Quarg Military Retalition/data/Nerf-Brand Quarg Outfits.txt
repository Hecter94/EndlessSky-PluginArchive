	description "These batteries use exotic miniaturization techniques to fit massive quantities of fuel and energy. The capacity of these wonders of miniaturization is such that many non-Quarg vessels could conceivably use a single one of these batteries in place of a reactor. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

This highly heat and size efficient reactor fuels the energy-guzzling, but mass and thermal efficient, Quarg systems. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "The Skylance has been the Quarg’s standard weapon for millennia, and for good reason. Powerful enough to punch through shield and hull alike, accurate enough to eliminate fighters, and small enough to fit on freighters; it’s easy to see why most Quarg captains never use any other weapon. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "The standard Quarg anti-missile system is so ubiquitous it lacks a name. Literally called `The Anti-Missile`, `The Anti-Missile System`, or `The Anti-Missile Turret`, the Quarg have never seen a need for another missile defense system. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "These hybrid thrusters were designed to require as few additional outfits for proper functionality as possible. An integrated generator provides slightly less energy than consumed by the thruster, with a capacitor array covering the gap. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "This hybrid steering was designed to require as few additional outfits as possible. The modifications give it the capacity to operate only slightly below peak performance with no additional hardware. As long as the capacitors are occasionally allowed to recharge it can operate indefinitely with no energy input. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "The standard Quarg thruster trades power and space efficiency for a reversible thrusting system. This innovation allows Quarg ships an unprecedented level of maneuverability, if not speed. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	description "The Quarg's Medium Graviton Steering is strangely ineffective for such a technologically advanced engine. Quarg consider turning speed mostly irrelevant for most vessels. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."

	"cooling" 4.0
	description "When the Wardrake’s small frame proved unable to handle the thermal output of the newly designed hybrid propulsion systems, the Quarg were forced to innovate further. The result was an energy efficient shield generator powered in part by the vessel’s waste heat. This version is one of the Nerf-brand Quarg outfits designed specifically for sale to technologically inferior friends."
