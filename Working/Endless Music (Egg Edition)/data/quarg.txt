            `   You try to fix your speakers, and discover that your speakers are being piggybacked by a broadcast, but cannot find a way to fix your speakers otherwise. Looks like the only way to stop hearing the music is to leave <planet>, so that you are far enough away from the broadcast to not hear it, and land again the next day, when hopefully the music will have stopped.`
