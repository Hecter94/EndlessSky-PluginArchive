	description "This hefty 150mm cannon fires rounds at an obscene rate. Each of the explosive shells detonates on impact with both shields and hull, delivering reliable damage against enemies. Its accuracy is lacking, but it can deliver devastating damage up close. As an added advantage, the autocannon has negligible energy consumption and generates relatively little heat."

	description "This turret mounted autocannon permits firing from a slower ship against faster moving targets without requiring a transition. In addition, although it uses the same 150mm rounds as its fixed brethren, the turret has twice the firing rate due to a second barrel and firing mechanism. The accuracy of the platform is decreased due to the extreme fire rate."
