			`	Jonah chuckles. "Aren't we all."`
			`	"They're worse than the raiders," you say. "At least the raiders are honest about what they're doing. 'We regret that it is our duty to destroy you?' Seriously? Who says that?"`
			`	"Most of them are jackasses," Jonah agrees. "There are a few good ones, though."`
			`	"Huh. I'll believe that when I meet one and he doesn't try to blow me away on sight."`
			`	"Maybe someday you'll get your chance. But I'm glad to hear you still consider yourself a native of the Pirate planets."`
			`	"Yeah? Why is that?"`
			`	"I have a mission for you, if you're interested," Jonah says.`
				goto mission

			`	Jonah smiles his gruesome smile. "Don't I know it! You're not doing too badly for yourself, though. Pretty soon you'll be wealthy enough you could leave us and buy yourself a place among the Republic merchant class if you wanted to, I expect. I hope you haven't forgotten there are other things in this galaxy besides credits, though."`
			choice
				`	Yeah, it's trite but true, money isn't everything.`
					goto "not just money"
				`	No, actually everything does come down to money in the end.`
			`	"Things worth more than money?" you say. "Yeah, I know the shtick, but I hadn't expected to hear it from you. I always figured that was something people said to make themselves feel better about not having the credits they want."`
			`	"I'm sorry to hear you say that. I take it you wouldn't be interested a mission that's not just about the money?"`
				goto mission
			label "not just money"
			`	"Other things than credits?" you ask, feigning shock. "And you call yourself a star captain! No, you're right though. Credits are important but they're not everything."`
			`	"I was hoping you'd say that. I have a mission for you, if you're interested."`
			label mission
			choice
				`	"What is it?"`
			`	"There's a small community on <planet> that I've been in contact with. They're refugees, really. The warlord who controlled their village is especially brutal. He ran short on funds and decided to make it up by doubling their taxes. When they couldn't pay he killed every firstborn in the community. Very biblical of him."`
			`	"Biblical?" you ask.`
			`	"Nevermind, it's an ancient text. Anyway, I heard about the incident from a, ah," Jonah hesitates. "A friend. So I got in touch with the villagers and helped them find a place out of reach of their old warlord where they could set up a new settlement. Problem is, <planet> is like the rest of the Pirate planets: the only real infrastructure is what the warlords themselves provide. They're free, and doing well, considering, but there are some things they can't provide for themselves. That's where you come in." Jonah stops and looks at you."`
			choice
				`	"Go on."`
				`	"Sorry, Jonah, but I think you'll need to find someone else for this job."`
					decline
			`	"Right now they particularly need <commodity>. I've helped them set up a credit account with the Republic banks and they have a bit of money, but it's not much. They can afford to pay <payment> for delivery. I've got the cargo set aside and can load it on your ship immediately. If you take the job I'll give you instructions on how to find them. You make delivery and they'll give you a credit chit with a confirmation number. Enter the number into your ship computer and your account will be credited with <payment>. It's a bit more complicated than a drop-off at the port, but that's because these folks aren't hooked up to the banking network."`
			`	"I see," you say.`
			`	"It's less than the going rate, I know, but you'd be doing it for a good cause. You in?"`
			choice
				`	"Sure."`
				`	"Charity work isn't for me, I'm afraid. I wish you luck, though."`
					decline
			`	"One more thing before you agree. It's vital that the Warlords not find the location of the settlement, if they do they'll come in later and wipe it out. They don't want the precedent. If they see you they may try to stop you, or they may just sit back and watch. Either way, you'll need to lose or destroy any spies before you make the final delivery."`
			`	"The warlords? You talk about them like they're some kind of a cabal or something."`
			`	"Yeah, you'd expect they'd stick to themselves, wouldn't you? And most of them do. But some of them understand that if things change too much in the Pirate worlds they could be on the way out, and they're willing to work together to keep that from happening."`
			choice
				`	"If I can help these folks out by shipping some <commodity>, I'll do it."`
				`	"You know, I wish I help, but staying clear of the Republic and the Merchants is bad enough, I don't want to add another enemy to the list. Sorry."`
					decline

You need to hike through the heavily forested countryside to the rendezvous and lead a crew of villagers back to your ship.`
			`	By the time you're ready to start unloading you're already exhausted, but the villagers are overjoyed to have the <commodity>. Unloading the cargo takes another couple of hours, what with the villagers' disorganization and tendency to break into a chaos of cheers and back-slapping whenever the mood strikes. Only after they're done do they realize they forgot the payment chit in the village, and a runner is sent after it.`
			`	He finally returns with the chit and a basket of home-baked pastries which the villagers press on you along with the payment. You enter the chit into your computer and your payment of <payment> is credited to your account. You then have to clear the villagers away from the ship so they won't be harmed by the blast of takeoff - two or three times, for a few of them. By the time you climb back into the cockpit your ship has been on the ground for almost five hours and you're covered in sweat and tree sap. The pastries are a bit mashed but excellent.`
