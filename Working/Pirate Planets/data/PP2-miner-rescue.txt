			`You find Jonah sipping a cup of tea at a spaceport cafe. As always, the gruesome scar on his cheek gives you a moment of shock when you see it. You wonder why he does nothing to cover it.`
			`	"Jonah!" you call out. He turns and sees you, and beckons you over.`
			`	"Hey <first>. Want something to drink? They have a decent oolong here."`
			`	"Just coffee for me," you say.`
			`	Jonah signals a waiter, who quickly brings you a cup. "So, things been going well? Deliveries haven't been giving you trouble, have they?"`
			choice
				`	"No, no trouble at all."`
					goto "no trouble"
				`	"Actually, I've been meaning to talk to you about that."`
			`	"About what?" Jonah asks. "You haven't been getting trouble from the recipients, have you?"`
			`	"No, there's no trouble there. I just don't appreciate the way you've been handing out the jobs. I don't mind doing these jobs for you now and then, I know it's for a good cause. But I've got to earn a living too, and I can't do that when I'm constantly having to drop what I'm doing and head off on another one of your charity case deliveries."`
			`	Jonah nods, looking at you. When you say nothing more he says, "I see. I understand how you feel, and I wish I could say it was going to get easier. You know I wouldn't be asking you to do these deliveries if it weren't important."`
			`	"Yeah, I know that, but--"`
			`	"We're really hitting the warlords where it hurts. They make money from pirate raids, sure, and from drug sales to the inner worlds. And for the little guys, it's boom and bust, and all they care about is the next score. But the bigger outfits, they need to keep the fuel refineries running, and farmers to supply their food. That's where the real money is anyway, in providing services to the folks who want to go out and try to get themselves killed: food, prostitutes, liquor, and so on. And the fuel and repair services to keep their ships running, don't forget that. And all that takes people. Slaves, for some of it. And farming villages who've got no choice but to give their crops away to whatever Warlord offers them protection. And that leaves everybody else desperate for whatever work they can get at whatever wage they can earn. Because once you're here in the Pirate worlds, for most people there's no way out."`

			`	"Yes," Jonah says. "And what we're doing is working, the Warlords are starting to worry. That's why they've been coming after you and the other pilots doing deliveries. Those deliveries keep the communities we're supporting from going under. That's important not just for their sakes, but because if they get desperate enough they'll go back to the warlords. Most of 'em figure it's better to live under a brutal overlord who feeds you than starve as a free man."`
			`	"Yes," you say. "But--"`
			`	"Yes, I know, the missions don't pay very well. I understand, dedication to the cause isn't always enough." Jonah leans back in his chair and makes a show of considering. "You've been working with the Pirate Planets for a while now, maybe it's time you were getting a salary. It would involve taking on some new responsibilities, though. Interested?"`

			`	"I'm sorry to hear that. If you want to go you can go. But understand that if you leave, that's it," Jonah says. "I'm not going to let someone who's not committed back in later, and if the warlords come after you because of your association with me I won't be able to protect you. We just don't have the resources. Do you still want out?"`

You should know though, once you leave you're out. I can't rely on someone who's not committed. And I can't protect you if the Warlords come after you because of your association with me."`

There are even rumors that some of the pirate clans based there are fronts for Syndicate activity, though I don't know as I believe that - I figure the Syndicate is like the Republic, they're happy to make use of us when it suits them but they're careful not too get to friendly. Covert's money is in mining and Buccaneer Bay's is in shipbuilding, and between the two of them they're a major source of the Warlord's power. All the most powerful Warlords have connections there. I've always figured there was no way to include them in our plans. They're too far away through hostile systems, and the Warlords are too powerful there."`

There are a lot of very powerful Warlords living there, all with large security forces and all armed to the teeth. Even if there are communities there who would want our help, getting it to them would be too risky. No, I think Covert is our chance."`

			`	"Yes, they do." Jonah fingered the scar on his cheek, which you remember he received while working the Haven mines. "But I always thought it would be too risky to make the attempt, there's just too much security on Covert. But I recently heard something that changes that."`
			`	"What's that?" you ask.`

We escaped the mines together, don't know how he ended up doing that kind of work again. Though I guess it's not that surprising, mining is what he knows, and they need miners on Covert. He was never the adventurous one."`
			`	He doesn't continue, and seems ready stare off into space for a while. You prompt him with, "What was in the note?"`
			`	"Oh, yes. He needs my help," Jonah says. "Things are bad on Covert, real bad. They're not just mining regular metals, or even rare earths, they're mining radioactives. To build power generators on Buccaneer Bay, I suppose, I don't know. But miners are getting sick, and they're not getting medical care. Mike, that's my friend, he'd heard rumors about what we were doing up here in the north and he figured it must be me. So he got me a message asking for help."`
			`	"So what do you want me to do?"`
			`	"I'm can't do anything, I can't leave the north. The Warlords are starting to really notice what we're doing and we can't afford to let up. So you are going to go get my friend and anyone he has with him and bring them here. I've already got my man Max out there arranging things so you can pick them up."`

			`	"There are a few minor mines, but that doesn't matter, they're going to have to give up mining. You can't put food on the table mining unless you've got a market for your ore, and we're going to have to keep these folks hidden. They're going to have to provide for themselves, and that means farming and fishing. They'll get help, but they're going to have to adapt. If they don't like it they can stay on Covert. Any other questions?"`

If you refuel at Acheron before you go, in the Moktar system, it's a total of eight jumps, the freighters should just be able to make that. I leave it to you to make sure your flagship can handle it. Got it?"`
