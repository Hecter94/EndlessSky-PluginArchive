	`The raiders struck during the early hours of the morning and left no one in your isolated settlement alive. If you'd been where you were supposed to be you'd be dead along with them. Instead you were out on a nearby hilltop trying to get away from the everpresent smell of sheep dung and wondering what it would be like to fly between the stars. When the gunshots started you hid, cursing yourself for a coward yet knowing you had no choice.`
	`	By the time you work up the courage to return you find the settlement in ruins. There are bodies everywhere, and everything of value has been carted off by the raiders.`
	`	There is one thing, though. One of the raiders' ships is standing abandoned in a turnip field. You discover the reason as you approach - its captain lay dead of a gunshot in the dirt in front of the hatch. His shirt bears a an emblem you don't recognize: a stylized skull with two parallel curves across the front of it where you might have expected crossed bones. He had to have been shot by one of the other pirates, since you know no one in the settlement had a gun. You don't know what the fight was over and you don't know how long until the other raiders return for the dead man's ship.`
	`	You study the skull emblem closely, it's your only clue to who it was that murdered your friends and family.`
	`	But you can't afford to take too long. Unless you want to wait for the monthly airship the local warlord sends for taxes, the abandoned Star Barge is your only way back to civilization.`
	`	You climb into the starship.`

			`	You've never been in the cockpit of a starship before, but your uncle Max spent time in space and you used to listen to his stories over and over again. It's not like you imagined it would be. Everything is dingy, and there's dirt everywhere. There are food wrappers kicked into the corners under the console, and the pilot's seat has probably held thousands of pilots' bottoms, and looks it. As a farmer you're used to dirt, but this is different. Real dirt is clean, this is just dirty.`
			`	But you don't have time to clean up, or to be squeamish. The pirates could be back any minute, and it's time to make a choice. Do you take off in the ship, fleeing the pirates? Or do you get back out and take your chances in the ruined farm? If they return and find you in the ship they surely won't be pleased.`
			choice
				`	Play it safe and get out of the ship.`
				`	Embark on a life of high adventure.`
					goto takeoff
			`	You climb back out of the Star Barge. You give it a wistful pat as you leave it, but you know you are not cut out to be a star captain. You go back to the ruined settlement and try to take an inventory of your resources.`
			`	An couple of hours later you have a fire going and are trying to heat a can of creamed spinach, which was all you were able to find to eat. As you are struggling to open the can without a can opener you hear a roar overhead. The pirates have returned for their Star Barge. You try to hide, but they notice your fire and make a search. They find you quickly. Afraid that you will describe them to your warlord and get them in trouble, they shoot you on the spot. You are dead.`
				die
			label takeoff
			`	Before you take off you spend a few moments scratching the ID marking off the ship with dirt and gravel. You can claim they were erased by space dust, and paint on something new when you get a chance. You then enter the ship's new name into its transponder, eliminating as best you can any trace of its previous owner - other than the mess on the inside, and that will have to wait.`
			`	You decide that your best bet is to take of and then immediately land again at the Zenith spaceport. If the pirates are on their way back they may see you taking off from the settlement, but you could lose yourself among the other ships at the spaceport. Besides, there doesn't seem to be a hyperdrive installed on the ship, so fleeing to another system is out of the question. Struggling to remember everything your uncle Max ever said about his time in space, you power up the ship and launch.`

The Republic prides itself on its democratic institutions, and claims to have brought peace and prosperity to human history.`

		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In the poorer and more remote star systems of the human-inhabited galaxy the Republic Navy is given free reign to enforce the law as they see fit. Usually this involves destroying any ships not registered as merchants with the Republic, and assuming after the fact that any such ships must clearly have broken the law. As a result, few in the Pirate planets see much use for Republic law, and feel no compunctions at all about engaging in actual piracy if they can get away with it - a fact which merely reinforces the Republic's attitude toward inhabitants of the Pirate worlds.`

			`	The landing was a bit shaky and you hope no one was watching. The good news is that you have a cargo, probably goods stolen from your settlement. You were worried there would be suspicion over a new ship landing at the spaceport, but there was very little scrutiny during the landing process. Not surprising, really, this wasn't a planet where it paid to be to nosy.`
			`	But once you're on the ground a man with an ugly scar across his cheek and grimy overalls walks over and hooks up the refueling hoses. As he does so he asks your name. You don't know whether the raiders who destroyed your settlement have access the names of the people living there, but once they find their Star Barge gone they'll surely start looking for anyone who survived. Besides, you're beginning a new life, it would be good to have a true star captain's name, something that people will remember. Or maybe you want something less flashy, a name people won't remark upon until it's too late? You think for a split second, but you don't have much time.`
			name
			`	The man squints at you suspiciously, and punches the name into his tablet, which beeps angrily. "Hm," he says. "Not in the system. You'll want to get that straigtened out before you try to sell your cargo."`
			`	You stammer agreement, and the scarred fellow nods. You hope he believes it's a simple mix-up.`
			`	But he's right, you know. You can't buy and sell goods, not to mention upgrade your ship, without a credit account, which you don't have, even under your real name. You start to have second thoughts. Maybe being a star captain isn't all it's cracked up to be, and you'd be better off making a run for it. Find a farm somewhere and get a job harvesting turnips or tending sheep. That's all you know how to do, anyway, isn't it?`
			`	No. You have a ship, and you've got nothing to lose. Surely you're not the first person to show up without a record, there has to be someone who could get you into the system.`
			`	Once you get rid of the nosy refueling agent you lock the ship down using keys you find in a storage cabinet and set out to explore the spaceport.`
