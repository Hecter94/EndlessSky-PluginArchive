planet Zenith
	shipyard "Scrap"
	description `Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`
	description `	Several fishing and farming settlements have been founded near the equator. Your small village, where you and your community kept a small turnip farm and a few sheep, numbered among them until it was destroyed by pirate raiders. In addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous cement fortresses.`
	spaceport `To create a spaceport for Zenith, one enterprising privateer a few centuries ago used a mixture of explosives and heavy machinery to shift the top of one of the tallest mountains down into the neighboring valleys, creating a high plateau that is (usually) above the fog line. There are landing pads both for starships and for airships that carry cargo to and from the settlements elsewhere on the planet. The planet produces little in the way of exports, but there is nonetheless a small, steady trickle of traffic in and out of the spaceport.`
