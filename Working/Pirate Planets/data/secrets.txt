planet "Cerberus Station"
	attributes pirate station "north pirate"
	landscape land/station3
	description `Long ago some enterprising privateer took a mined-out asteroid, hollowed it out even further, and constructed a habitat out of it. Since then it's grown haphazardly, expanding randomly in every direction as inhabitants decided they needed more room and scrounged together materials with which to build. Denizens of the station sometimes make most of their income guiding newcomers around it's labyrinthine corridors.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is built into the rocky core of the station, part of the asteroid from which the original habitat was built. The rough-hewn rock and dim lighting gives the place a cave-like atmosphere, an impression only encouraged by the unique varieties of mold and fungus growing in cracks and crevices.`

planet "Acheron Station"
	attributes pirate station "north pirate"
	landscape land/station3
	description `Acheron station was a cobbled together mess of pipes and shipping containers, and whatever else the builders had on hand at the time. But positioned far outside the main Republic shipping routes, and almost as far out of reach of Republic enforcement, many pirates and social outcasts found it an important port of call and place of refuge.`
	spaceport `The Acheron spaceport brought new meaning to the phrase 'open-air.' There was no attempt to enclose the massive network of struts and girders and provide life support, instead visitors were required to wear vacuum suits at all times. Restaurants and some of the shops included and airlock and life support, so that customers could take off their helmets. Elsewhere people were required to do business through helmet face-plates.`

planet "Styx Station"
	attributes pirate station "north pirate"
	landscape land/station3
	description `Styx station is little more than an acretion of habitats and random containers, welded together just well enough to be air tight. Nonetheless it's home to a bustling, if eclectic, community of pirates, smuglers, and other ne'er-do-wells.`
	spaceport `The dock on Styx was hardly worthy of the name, just a convenient place for ships to clamp on to the station and offload cargo and passengers. But once through the airlock into the station proper visitors found themselves inside a large room made from a repurposed refinery reservoir. Shops and stalls, and plenty of bars, clung to every available surface, and several more were strung out on cables so that they seemed to float in midair in the zero-G room.`
