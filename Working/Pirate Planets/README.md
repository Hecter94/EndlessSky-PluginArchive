## A mod with a new start and storyline for endless-sky

The pirate worlds have always been an essential part of the Republic,
necessary and despised at the same time. They take the pressure off
inner-world jails by providing a place for scoundrels and
ne'er-do-wells to flee, and they provide a convenient place for
wealthy, inner-world aristos to conduct less-than-legal
business. Savvy operators in the Pirate worlds have understood that
this was their role since before the Republic even existed, and have
always been sure to offer a quiet marketplace where law-abiding
citizen can buy drugs, slaves, and other things their neighbors
wouldn't approve of. In return, these Pirate world operators, half
crime-lord and half medieval warlord, can rest secure in the knowledge
that they are too useful to the Paradise worlds to ever face any
serious attempt to bring them to justice.

It's a win-win scenario - for everyone but the people of the Pirate
worlds.  Theirs is a life of hard labor and a precarious existence,
where the will of the local Warlord is absolute.

In this mod you start as a member of a poor farming community on one
of the Pirate worlds. Your village has just been massacred by a rogue
band of pirate raiders, yet you have managed to steal one of their
ships and escape. You have a chance to seek justice, wealth, or
perhaps bring true political change to the Pirate worlds.
