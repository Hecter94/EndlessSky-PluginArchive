			label papers
			`	Eireen prepared a detailed contract for this project. The first part lists your full name, your current profession and status, the specifications of the new ship type as well as some parts of your conversation. - She must have a good memory. - The second part names Southbound Shipyard as official contracting partner, her as the person who is responsible for the project, the construction of three prototypes, their responsibilies for quality testing, and some of these no-warranties-paragraphs. The third paragraph explains the payment conditions and the timeline:`
# developers note: 2800k salaries and other expenses plus 3x 9.9M for the three prototypes
			`	You have to pay 32.5 million credits in advance. Payment is due within 7 days after the contract is signed. The project is estimated to take 24 weeks. In case two of the prototypes get destroyed in the early testings, you have to make a second payment of 9.9 million credits.`
			`	The following sections list the general terms and conditions of the shipyard for customized ships as well as for standard ships.`
			`	After you seem to have finished reading she asks you: "Do you have any questions left?"`
			choice
				`	"No, everything looks correct."`
					goto readytosign
				`	"You said I would eventually get one of the prototypes afterwards. What happens with the other one?"`
			`	"Oh, don't worry, we don't sell it. You know, we have to ensure the ship does not break apart out of the sudden... Two of the prototypes get destroyed during the intense testing program. The easiest way to realiably find out the limits of structural integrity, heat dissipation etc. is to increase the stress to the hull further and further until it breaks. Obviously, this is a destructive process, but a very reliable one."`
			`	"Ah okay, got it. Safety first."`

			label readytosign
			`	"I just have to sign once here, on every copy, is that correct?" you ask.`
			`	"Yes, you sign on the left side and I will sign on the right side. You get one copy, I get one and one is for the shipyard."`
			choice
				`	(Sign the contract.)`
					goto sign
				`	"I am sorry, but I can't sign this. I have changed my mind on the whole issue. Please accept my apologize, Eireen."`
			`	"That happens in two out of three cases, Captain <last>. I got used to it. But I had a good very feeling this time."`
