In this plugin, you establish some relation to Eireen, one of the chief engineers for cargo affairs at Southbound Shipyards on Zug.
You need to meet a certain minimum fleet / game progress to meet her (as of now: either 1200 cargo space, or 50M networth, or a third (lower) condition).
But your first contact - which is so far the main conversation of this plugin (more to follow) - heavily depends on or progress in the games campaigns.

This Plugin needs [Pull 2383, status: merged](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/2383) in order to work.
This Plugin uses [Pull 2413, status: not merged](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/2413) but it will work without that one. The feature is, as of now, only used for branches.

As one of the younger chief engineers in the cargo department, Eireen is pretty ambitious and interested in developing the cargo business, including but not limiting to advancing the Hauler series. Eventually you will become the one who will sponsor her in the development of a next generation (heavy) freighter.


Currently, this plugin is WORK IN PROGRESS.
