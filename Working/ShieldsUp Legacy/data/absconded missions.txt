			`The Hai here seem different than those of the systems to the west. Unlike the Unfettered, they do not attack others, but unlike the Hai who allow humans to live among them, they do not seem very open to contact.`
			`	No one approaches you as you land, or even look your way in interest.`
			choice
				`	(Find somebody to talk to.)`
				`	(Don't bother them now.)`
					defer
			
			`	You walk over to one of the Hai and ask them who they are.`
			`	The Hai reaches into a pouch that he has with him and pulls out some sort of device. He speaks into it in the Hai language and the box begins to speak in the human language.`
			`	"My name is Farood," the Hai tells you. He does not elaborate beyond that, seemingly waiting for you to ask something else.`
			choice
				`	"What are the Hai doing here?"`
					goto absconded
				`	"Why are you here?"`
			
			`	"I was born here," Farood says, rather bluntly. You pause for a second while trying to find a question that could get you the answer you want when Farood begins to speak.`
			`	"I assume that you are meaning to ask what the Absconded are here for."`
			
			label absconded
			`	"We are here because we do not agree with those Hai of the Unfettered or of the Quarg. My ancestors decided to leave the rest of the Hai, taking with them the few Jump Drives that the Hai had after the war and colonizing these worlds here. For this, they call us `Absconded.`"`
			choice
				`	"What war are you talking about?"`
					goto war
				`	"Thank you for this information."`
			
			`	"You are welcome," Farood responds. Farood then turns and walks away, leaving you on your own.`

			`	"Hundreds of years ago, the Hai territory was raided by the aliens from the east. The Korath, they were called. They sent large warships with Jump Drives, able to travel between stars that are not linked. For decades, this war went on, and over the time we collected many Jump Drives. Suddenly, the war stopped, leaving us confused."`
			`	"Many of those who fought the Korath did not want to stop fighting. They had grown complacent in war after fighting for so many years. Those Hai traveled to the north and controlled three worlds and began to fight the Hai of the Quarg. We, the Absconded, did not want to see any more war, and as such we took the remaining Jump Drives to here."`
			choice
				`	"If you have been here for hundreds of years, why is it that you have not colonized all the systems nearby?"`
				`	"That is an interesting story. Thank you for this information."`
					decline
			
			`	Farood seems to sigh and pauses before speaking again.`
			`	"Those who came here were not the most advanced or... scientific. We took only our personal belongings and our ships. No terraforming technology was taken, and we did not want to return to Hai space lest we be attacked for leaving. As such, we had to reinvent the technology, and only very recently have we begun terraforming the entire cluster."`
			`	Suddenly, a bell sound comes from the far side of the spaceport and many of the Hai begin walking to their ships.`
			`	"I am sorry, but I have no more time to speak. I hope that you have learned what you desired." After putting the translation device back into his pouch, Farood outstreches his paw and shakes your hand, then makes his way to his ship and takes off.`
