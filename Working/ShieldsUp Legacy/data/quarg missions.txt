			`You detected star systems beyond known space before, but this is the first time in true, Quarg territory. You feel very out of place here, as there are a multitude of different species here, including Pug and Hai residents. The architecture is even more strange than what you have seen, the walls are all grey and of varying textures, the floors are colors that don't complement each other, and there doesn't seem to be a right angle anywhere.`
			`	You see what seems to be Korath civilians. They are much thinner and shorter than the militant Korath you have seen before, there are two of them, a tall one and a short one, possibly a child.`
			choice
				`	"Hello."`
			` 	The Korath looks up at you blankly, but after a few seconds of awkward silence it replies "Foraeh. Uc' iea sum coo' folo, yu un gliot geh gupo u muk. Sum iea krou'co teh umja hasp ouhh?"`
			choice
				`	"I've met your kind before."`
				`	Wait`

			`No matter what you do, the only reply you get is "Uc' iea sum coo' folo, yu un gliot geh gupo u muk. Sum iea krou'co teh umja hasp ouhh?" After a few tries the Korath simply goes back into the position it was before and stops moving. You stare for a few moments thinking it has perished, until the shorter Korath pulls back its sleeve to reveal a pen looking device wrapped about its wrist, and a piece of synthetic paper. The device writes something on the piece of synthetic paper,  detaches itself from its wrist, walks up your body, puts the piece of paper in your hands, and then re-attaches itself to its hand.`
			`It reads "Fock ouf."`

				`	Look for a Quarg.`
					goto quarg
				`	Look for a Hai.`
				`	Walk out of the Space Port`

			`	It doesn't take long for you to find a Hai, you approach one that doesn't seem to be doing anything and introduce yourself.`
			choice
				`	"Hello, I am <first> <last>. May I ask you a question?"`

			`	The Hai nods. "I see you are one of the monkeys who speak with the inferiors."`
			`	You are taken aback, because you would have never expected the unfettered Hai to have made it here, but you ask your question anyway.`
			choice
				`	"How did you get here"`										goto drak
				`	"What is this place?"`
			
			`	"Silly monkey, not all Hai are stupid like the ones fighting in our origin. We, superior Hai, broke away long time ago, made our own jump drive. We discover all species before humans exploit the first cow."`
			choice
				`	"What is this place?"`
			
			label drak
			`	"The spaceport is many lifetimes older than Hai have traveled the stars. Far advanced than Hai own technology. Many times advanced than stupid brethren. Many tens of times advanced than stupid altered Hai" The Hai seems to speak with disgust at the last sentence.`
			choice
				`	"What about all the other species here?"`

			`	"Drak allow many species to be ferried here. Many species decline, fear Quarg. Few accept. The few are wise. We do not need ferries, we ferry ourselves. None others ferry themselves, except for Pug... And you, human."`
			choice
				`	Find a Quarg.`
				`	Walk out of the spaceport.`
					goto closing
			
			label quarg
			`	You find a Quarg the moment you look at the crowd, because they are the tallest beings here. You approach one and practically have to shout at it in order to notice you in the crowd. It takes you to an empty waiting room and sits in a chair twice your height that slants forward in the middle, looking rather uncomfortable. "Hello." It says, leaning forward so that its head is level with yours. "I see your species stole warp drives from the Korath... What questions may you have?"`
			choice
				`	"What is this place?"`
					goto thisplace
				`	"How are there so many species here?"`
			
			`	"There are many ways to travel stars. Some ways use hops. Others walk the paths. Still, others travel many Etoiles at once. The Drak invites many species it sees wise enough to what you call boiling soup."`
			choice
				`	"Boiling soup?"`

			`	"Yes, as in soup, different species of plants are together, the different races are those plants here."`
			choice
				`	"What is this place?"`

			label thisplace
			`	"The port was made many life times ago. Quarg life times. Then, Quarg only subsumed Quarg, still very busy. The Korath were still enemies, still destructive in their ways. Very reckless, like your species, human. Now they learn, they raid reckless species, not peaceful ones, such as the Quarg, The Hai, The Drak, The Pug." It bows.`
			choice
				`	"Thank you." Bow in return`
				`	Leave.`

			label closing
			`	You walk back into your ship, now with a much more open mind than before.`
