	description `Stylized in the shape of old Earth submarines, the Navy Prowler provides the same role as its aquatic forebears - a silent killer. Its onboard sensor masking suite makes the ship all but invisible to enemy radar, and its multiple Typhoon Torpedo launchers allow for swift hit-and-run tactics against targets. It is the first human ship to carry anything that can be called close to a "cloaking device," although its properties are rather limited, only allowing for visual cloaking through the use of special projector systems, and unable to hide from radar. However, that does have its uses, as most ship turrets track optically, and so it can hide from those. Due to its hull being covered in so many delicate projector arrays, its hull cannot be accessed while cloaked, and therefore it may not conduct any repair of its hull while the cloaking device is engaged, and, if the hull takes any significant damage, the cloaking device is disabled and can no longer work. While cloaked it also regenerates shields significantly slower due to interference from the cloak. Its defenses are relatively light, however, so it usually relies on its speed and sensor masking suite for protection.`
