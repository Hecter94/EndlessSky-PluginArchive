    description "Nobody knows the origin of the mythical Warp Drive, more commonly known as the Red Jump Drive. After their falures trying to figure out a normal jump drive, human engineers didn't dare to touch this one. It make longer jumps than a normal jump drive, and seems to have a built in ramscoop array. It can also navigate unstable wormholes due to what appears to be a glowing red keystone."
