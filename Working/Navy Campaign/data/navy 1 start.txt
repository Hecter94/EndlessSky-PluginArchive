			`Howell's expression hardens as his gaze turns left and skyward. "With rumblings of war starting in the South, and pirates massing in the North, the Navy is going to be stretched thin." His gaze returns to you. "As of today, you haved been approved for Navy Tier I Enlistment status. As part of being inducted as a Navy Captainer, you'll receive a daily stipend of 500 credits per day, and you will receive a Navy Frigate as your first deployment. You are very lucky to be benefitting from this grant, most other captains with a commission such as yours do not receive such favor. However, due to an analysis of your combat it was deemed an appropriate investment. At ease."`

			`	You let your hand drop to your side as you nod firmly. "What are my orders, Colonel?"
			`	"Your first assignment," he begins, taking a uniform handed to him by the trooper to his left (your right), "will be to rendezvous with Admiral William Danforth - he's been tasked to deal with the pirates that are starting to gather up North. As for your civilian ships, well, just as in the days of the American Revolution, we do not object to the assistance, but your personal property is your responsibility. Understood?"`
			`"Yes, sir!"`
			`He hands you the uniform - it's the familiar blue Navy jumpsuit, speckled with orange and gold highlights here and there. Your hands are trembling slightly as you take the uniform from his hands - this is really happening, you think to yourself.`

			`Before you set out for the spaceport, you decide to try your new uniform on. Amazingly, it fits like a glove - you have to wonder how they managed to get the size so perfectly.`
			`	Stepping out of your ship, fully-dressed, you make your way to the spaceport. The walk is uneventful, for the most part, but every now and again, some of the locals slightly turn to look at you. Given the current climate, you can't tell if it's because they're looks of awe or suspicion - you decide to settle on the former.`

# Warrant Officer is a below-captain rank

			`You meet with Admiral Danforth in a modestly-sized conference room. There are many others who have enlisted sitting around you. "Welcome to Navy services," Danforth begins, "otherwise known as boot camp. There's a lot you'll be learning, but let me start with one of the most important things first: Navy ships are expensive." There's a few chuckles from the seated enlisted, but stern looks from both Danforth and their peers quickly quiets them down. "That is why you are here."`
			`Danforth clears his throat before he continues. "While you are stationed here with us, you will be paid for each Navy ship that you assist in Northern Pirate Territory, which includes the following systems:`
			``
			`	Mintaka...`
			`	Gorvi...`
			`	Tortor...`
			`	Almaaz...`
			`	Unagi...`
			`	Arneb...`
			`	Alnilam...`
			`	...and Hatysa."`
			``
			`Several of the enlisted present quietly chatter amongst themselves in various tones. "I cannot emphasize this enough, ladies and gentlemen," Danforth warns. "With all the ships we lost in the nuclear attack, we simply can NOT afford to lose more ships. Each of you will report to the base on <destination> for your first assignment. Any questions?"`

			`	A short stroll through the spaceport makes you realize Farpoint is appropriately-named - beyond the walls of the base, the scorching desert sands stretch farther than the eye can see. If this isn't the middle of nowhere, you could certainly see it from here. Which, you muse to yourself, isn't necessarily a bad thing - the remoteness and elevated security means someone would need unfathomably poor judgement to try anything out here.`

			`	"Thank you once again for your assistance, Captain <last>," he begins as he sits down next to you. "The sensor logs you provided don't seem to indicate much change in pirate activity - granted, those are just the three nearest systems, so it's somewhat expected." He sits up a bit straighter, leaning back slightly while doing so. "But now, we need to do a bit more in-depth analysis. The next systems we need scanned are Almaaz and Unagi. As you'll be passing by Freedom, which is well-known for its anarchy, this mission is beyond what most other merchants would be comfortable with... and as a result, the payment will also be substantially more.

			`While there are scant few establishments to begin with, the Stardust Pub appears to be one of the more popular places to eat, judging by the crowd at the entrance. Among those gathered, you notice, and subsequently join, Admiral Danforth; however, his expression is one that you can only describe as "hesitant."`
			`	"You've done a fantastic job so far, Captain <last>," he begins, looking straight ahead, "and I need your talents once more. We're sending you straight into the heart of the Northern Pirates to track their fleet presence in Arneb, Alnilam and Hatsya. I won't lie to you - even most Navy recruits tend to be wary operating so remotely, and you will be compensated appropriately."`

			`	Danforth smiles broadly. "We need more men and women like you in the Navy, Captain - you certainly are a rare breed. Come on. My treat," he says, as he walks into the pub.`
			`	The two of you are shown a table along one of the walls of the Stardust. Just from what you see, it's clear the owners wanted their patrons to feel more like they were part of civilization, not on a barren rock as far away as one could be from it. After the waitstaff takes your orders, Danforth makes a couple glances left and right before he addresses you.`
			`	"You probably guessed it already, but there's an ulterior motive to meet here, <last>. I've been reviewing the logs you collected, and what I'm seeing bothers me. So far, it doesn't look like much has changed in the level of activity we're used to seeing in those systems - frankly, if anything, there's actually been less activity in those systems. You know that old saying: 'It's quiet. Too quiet.'"`
			`	"Yeah," you agree, looking slightly downward as you put a hand to your chin. "It feels like the calm before the storm."`
			`	"Indeed. They're planning something... but what, I don't know. Hopefully this last round of scanning will clear things up."`
			`A moment later, the waiters bring your meals to you and the two of you begin eating. As the two of you continue idle banter, you realize that not many officers usually have such a personal relationship with Admirals - Danforth is truly a rarity among them. Even though he far outranks you, he still insists on paying the bill for both of you. "One thing I've learned over the years," he comments, "is what actually being an Admiral entails. It's not just about the medals you earned and the battles you fought to reach this position - it's also the relationships you build and the friends you make along the way. Anyone can give orders, but if you only see your men as expendable resources, all those stars, medals and badges don't mean a thing."`
			`	"That's the other reason I brought you here, <last>," he adds while the two of you exit the pub. "I wanted to make it clear that just because I have a higher rank, that does *not* mean I should also feel superior to you. We're both humans, and on that note, equals. I'm sure my actions have proved as much, but my position does *not* give me the right to treat you like dirt, and any Admiral who tells you otherwise is either delusional, drunk, a liar or an idiot. Or all of the above."`
			`The two of you laugh for a second at his comment. "Anyway," he continues, "just like before, there's no need to engage any hostiles on your patrol. Just beware of Zenith and Haven - considering their locations, they're fairly well-guarded. Report back to me with the logs, and I'll personally make sure that you'll receive 250,000 credits for your work. Furthermore... I'm going to put in a good word on possibly getting you up to a First Class Captain, Captain."`
			`	"That is very gracious of you, sir," you reply with a nod. "And thank you for taking the time to talk to me - I promise you, I won't let you down."`
			`	"I know you won't, Captain. Good luck, and God bless you."`

			`When you come in for a landing, you can't help but feel like something's wrong. Just from how remote Farpoint is, the activity in the base usually rather low. But now the hangars are swarming with crews and ships ready to take off. In addition, unlike most times, when you might have to wait up to twenty minutes to land, the control tower gives you clearance almost immediately. For you to be moved to the front of the line so quickly, while certainly a nice change of pace, also sends a slight twinge of dread down your spine... which soon proves to be well-founded.`
			`	You quickly disembark the <ship> to find Danforth's aide waiting for you. The two of you quickly hurry to the Admiral's quarters, and find he's joined by other Navy officers. As you enter the room, instictively saluting as you do so, all eyes shift away from the table and towards you - and the looks you receive, in particular Danforth's, make you feel uneasy.`
			`	"Captain <last>, your timing is impeccable," Danforth says. "We just obtained your sensor logs, and it may have just been enough to prevent things from getting worse."`
			`	"... Worse, sir?" you ask, cautiously.`
			`	"Indeed," one of the officers says. "Things have well and truly hit the fan right as you got here."`
			`	"Hines, please," Danforth exasperatedly shushes the officer, raising his hand. "Just as we finished downloading your logs, a pirate fleet suddenly warped in. Most of them were either destroyed or routed back into the North, but one ship managed to escape. Most of us believe it's thanks to your sensor logs that we were able to halt their advance as much as we did."`
			`	"Even so, that one ship is now running amok amongst the systems South of us," another officer adds. "We could have done more if we'd-"`
			`	"We did as much as we could," you interrupt, silencing the room. "None of us could have possibly anticipated, let alone prepared for anything more than what those logs indicated."`
			`Most of the officers quietly talk amongst themselves at your response, but Hines keeps staring you down. You don't know why, but it seems like he feels threatened by you speaking as though you were a higher rank than he was.`
			`	"Captain <last>, at ease," Danforth finally says as he stands up from behind his desk. "We can go over the details later in the spaceport," he adds, walking towards you. "In the meantime, here's your bonus of <payment>, as promised."`

			`Your clearance to land on Lodestone was delayed by volcanic ash for about ten minutes before the port authorities allowed your fleet to land. "Fourth Port," as the spaceport is called, was built after the previous three ports were buried under Lodestone's numerous eruptions. Unlike your previous stay at <source>, where you would have struggled to have found a speck of dust in the mess hall, Fourth Port is a testament to the Syndicate's standards: warehouses of rusted sheetmetal, towering metal smokestacks that belching caustic ash, and barrels containing a disgusting yellowish liquid you can only hope are cleaning chemicals and not...something else.`
			`	 Landing in the hangar designated for your fleet doesn't do the Syndicate's image any favors, either. Workers are actively repairing parts of the walls and ceiling that you felt should've been replaced long ago, and the rickety scaffolding they've erected for the repair crews makes you worried, to say the least. The air in the hangar is also thick and stagnant, and almost makes you gag. You quickly call over the captains of the auxiliaries and make your way to the loading docks - it takes about ten minutes to make your way through the maze of corridors before you reach your destination.`
			`	Upon reaching the docks, several Syndicate dockworkers call you over to a large collection of cargo containers filled with the building materials bound for Geminus. "Took you long enough," one says with a cigarette hanging out the side of his mouth. "We've been waiting here for five hours with our thumbs up our butts for you Navy jarheads.

Could you please help us load our cargo onto our ships?"`
			`"Yeah, yeah, we'll get on it," he replies. "And thanks for proving my point, you jumpy little-," he pointedly directs at you. Only then do you realize Danforth will probably hear of your behavior - and it's a sure bet he will not be pleased by your conduct.`

			`The dockworker stops dead in his tracks at your genuine honesty. "Wait...you're serious?"`
			`	"I give you my word," you reply, nodding. Only then does the dockworker realize what a fool he's made of himself, glancing left and right with a cowed look.`
			`	"I don't know if I can," he laments, "I don't want to risk losing my job."`
			`	"Trust me," you reply gently, "whatever you say will not leave this dock."`
			`The dockworker thinks for a minute while he pulls out another cigarette. "Alright," he finally replies, "I'll talk. But only alone, and not here - too many prying eyes, you understand." You nod, and he signals the other dockworkers to begin loading the ships while the two of you head to a small office near the docks.`
			`Under a small, flickering light, the two of you sit down at a folding table. "Here's what happened," he finally says. "Last month, we got an order of some building materials for the base at New Iceland. Thing is, the guy they sent felt like he was entitled to the materials and gave us an earful for being, quote, 'ungrateful of their protection of Syndicate space,' unquote."`
			`	"The Navy is only responsible for protecting the Republic - the Syndicate tends to look after itself," you comment.`
			`	"See, that's what I told him. But the moment I did, he punched me right in the jaw and knocked me to the ground, telling me, 'you need to learn your place, you- Well he used a lot of choice words.' Once we had loaded the materials into his ships, he pulled me aside and specifically told me, 'if you tell anyone of what I did, I will kill you, your family, and everyone you loved - and I have files on hand to help me.' As large as the Navy is, I was inclined to believe him."`
			`	"I'm guessing you didn't report this to your bosses."`
			`	"Of course not. One, they wouldn't have done anything - most likely just brushed it off as 'he was having a bad day,' but that's the Syndicate for you. Two, they probably would've docked me a few days' pay for raising the issue - the Syndicate pays well, to be sure, but it's still just barely enough to make ends meet. And I wasn't about to call his bluff - no way am I putting my wife, my daughter and two sons in danger."`
			`	"Can you describe him?"`
			`	"Do you one better," he says as he stands up, walking over to a file cabinet. The drawers rattle and clunk as he pulls out a manilla-colored file with some photos inside. "I looked through security footage on the day he came through, in case I needed to 'disappear' for a bit." On a photo showing several Navy personnel walking alongside some forklifts, he points to one in particular - a face you quickly identify as Ranulph Hines. "That's him," he says, tapping Ranulph's face.`

With some trepidation, you even mention how Hines dealt with the slavers to the dockworkers, calling his actions "reprehensible," and can't believe a man such as he would even be allowed to serve in the Navy."`
			`The man simply sits there in silence, his mouth hanging slightly open.`
			`	"And this Republic Officer is doing these kinds of things...that man must actually be insane."`
			`	"That's putting it mildly," you reply. "I can only hope that he sees the fallacy of his actions, and does something about it before it's too late. Do you mind if I get copies of these? I might be able to pull a few strings and keep you and your family safe."`
			`	"Take 'em," he eagerly replies. He heads back to the file cabinet and procures a few holodisks - likely security footage of the event. "You'll need these, too, if you want to prove your claims; plus, if Hines comes here again, he won't find anything on me."`
			`As the two of you make your way back to the docks, you can't help but notice how much the fellow has changed from your initial encounter. What started off as an argument that could have spiraled out of control has ended with a potential ally. "You know, I don't think I ever got your name," you say. "Mine's <first> <last>."`
			`"Lucas Hadley," he replies. "Did you really mean what you said, <last>?"`
			`	"Every word, Hadley. I'll be sure to mention your situation to my superiors - I don't know if they'll be able to do anything about it, but I refuse to let this lie. Hines needs to answer for his actions."`

Don't waste your time fighting them - just make a beeline for the planet's surface and get here with the auxiliaries intact!"`
			`	"Understood, sir. We're on our way." Just as you terminate the link, one of the captains signals the last of the cargo has been loaded. You can only hope the Navy fleet can hold them off long enough to land...`

			`"Let me see," Danforth says, checking his computer. It takes a moment, but he eventually finds his calendar. "Ah, yes. I had sent him out to pick up some framulators for the base. Though I'm curious, <first>...why do you ask?"`
			`You glance over your shoulder, even though there's no-one who could possibly see you. "Admiral, Hines apparently *decked* Hadley because the latter offended his twisted sense of honor."`
			`"What?!?" he exclaims, visibly shocked. "Captain, this is a very serious accusation you're making," he warns, gravely. "I hope you have evidence to substantiate your claim."`
			`"One step ahead of you, Admiral," you say as you reach inside your vest. "Hadley provided these photos and holotapes to document the whole event."`
			`	"Wait," the admiral says. He presses a button on his desk, to which you suddenly hear numerous locking sounds. "Don't want to take any chances, <first> - I've locked all points of access so we can't be disturbed."`
			`	"Pretty slick, admiral," you reply, impressed. "Now...you need to see these."`
			`Danforth looks over the photos Hadley gave you, a grim expression on his face as he reviews the events of that day. After he's seen enough, he takes one of the holotapes and plays the security feeds. To your great surprise, the holotapes even have audio - normally, the cost of having audio on security cameras is seen as unnecessary, and too expensive. Listening to Hines threaten Hadley sends both a deep chill of terror and a burning demand for justice down your spine. In that one moment, any doubts Hines was a potential risk to the Republic were gone.`
			`After watching the tapes, all Danforth can do is sigh and sadly shake his head. "The man has well and truly lost his mind."`
			`"Admiral," you begin, "Hadley's in danger. I made a promise to him that I would get his family to safety. And I have no intention on breaking that promise. But what are we going to do about Hines?"`
			`"Leave Hines to me," Danforth replies. "Obviously, we can't do anything right now - Hines is a Lieutenant Commander, which is roughly the naval equivalent of a Major in the Marines. For us to publicly go after someone that far up the chain, people would start asking questions, and Hines would almost certainly suspect Hadley." Danforth opens a secure drawer in his desk, puts the photos and tapes inside, and locks the drawer. "As far as Hadley's family, unfortunately, it will have to wait - we need to keep the supply chain moving. However, the moment we have a lull in the action, I'll send you off to fulfill your promise to Hadley."`
			`Danforth then does a bit more clicking and typing on his computer. "This information you've provided is invaluable, Captain. You may well have just saved a man's life today, and for that, it's only fitting that you are rewarded." Your communicator suddenly beeps, to which you see an email from your bank account - another 1.5 million credits have been deposited into it from the Navy. Smiling warmly, you look back to the admiral. "That is very gracious of you sir. Thank you."`
			`	"It's the least I could do, Captain," he nods, smiling proudly. "Now, then. We have some troops and materiel that need to be delivered - the auxiliaries ought to be fully-retrofitted for the trip."`
			label end
			`Walking back out of the admiral's quarters, you find the auxiliaries in their "hybrid" configuration - perfect for the retrieval of the new recruits and base defenses. After a brief meeting with the captains of the auxiliaries, you make your way back to <ship> and prepare for takeoff.`

			`	His expression suddenly softens. "The name's Henry Radcliff. I need to talk to you in private, if you don't mind." You nod, then turn to the other auxiliary captains. "I'll handle this one," you say to them.`
			`Back aboard your ship, you lock the doors to your quarters before you and Radcliff sit down. "I'm glad I found you, Captain," he begins. "Ever since we both started working for the Syndicate, Lucas and I made a promise to watch each others' backs. And it's my understanding that you made a promise to him, as well?"`
			`	You nod. "When I learned that one of our officers had threatened Hadley, I wasn't about to let something like that slide."`
			`	"And I thank you for that - there's no way I could bring that to my boss, and anyone else would just ignore me. But with you here, I think we have a real chance at getting Hadley and his family to safety."`
			`	"So what's the plan?"`
			`Henry procures a small holo-projector. "When the bombings happened, Lucas and I knew we had to come up with a contingency in case things got ugly. After considering our options, we decided to select this place." The projector highlights Hermes in the Capella System.`
			`	"Hermes?" you say, with a sly grin. "That makes perfect sense. The planet's got orbital bombardment stations trained on the planet around the clock - if someone tried to tail you there, it's almost certain they'd be atomized by the relays."`
			`	"That's exactly what we were thinking. And it's still close enough to Syndicate Space that it wouldn't be that far of a trip. Ideally, we wanted to settle in the Deep, but that's too far away."`
			`The pair of you stand up. "I'll be sure to relay this to my superior officer, Henry," you reply, shaking his hand. "He's been trying to come up with a plan to get Hadley to safety, and this will be the break he needs."`
			`	"I want to thank you once again, Captain...?"`
			`	"<last>. <first> <last>, if you want, Henry."`
			`	"Thank you, <first>. Really, I can't thank you enough."`
			`A thought enters your head. "Henry...I know this might be asking a lot, but if it's possible, I have a favor to ask. I'm sure you're well-aware of the bombings of Geminus and Martini at this point - if you get any leads, can I ask you to be my eyes and ears?"`
			`"You got it, <last>," he replies without hesitation. "After all, you're bending over backwards to make sure one of my best friends is safe and sound. I'll let my other buddies know to keep an eye out for you - the more feelers we can put out, the better."`
			`The pair of you soon exit your ship and head back to the auxiliary captains. "I won't let you down, Captain," Henry says as he gets back in line. "Thanks for giving me this chance!"`

Each of the wide hallways is marked out like a road, with space in the center for electric carts carrying cargo, while pedestrians are relegated to the edges. Video cameras and sensors have been placed at every intersection, and access to the shipbuilding facilities is tightly controlled.`

The shuttle stops, and everyone climbs out.`

You step into a sleek lab, filled with scientists hunched over various displays and devices, of which you can guess the purpose of very few. John leads you down a long hallway to a sealed room, flanked by two marines with rifles. He pulls a key card out of his pocket, motions to one of the guards, who pulls out a card of his own, and they swipe them simultaneously. The door opens with a hiss and reveals a perfectly white room, and a table on which is seated a long device, which appears to be the latest from the Deep.`

Your destination is Lodestone, in the Ankaa system. You will need twenty-one tons of cargo space free for this mission. We have some fun for you when you get back," he says with a wink.

			`You slowly bring your ship into a low orbit while you are waiting for your acknowledgement from the control tower. You look off to your left and see John's Flivver mirroring your approach.
			`After what seems like hours, (but your ships clock tells you is seven minutes and thirty-seven seconds,) you finally receive your clearance from the tower, but instead of a landing slot, you are given a set of coordinates to (unsurprisingly) another abandoned factory, which you guess is the 'secure location' John mentioned. You see John's ship already accelerating, and so you quickly order the helm to follow suite.`
			`Several minutes later, you get a notification that you are closing on the designated coordinates, and you begin to descend. Quickly, the factory comes into view, but as you look closely, you notice several slightly hidden anti-aircraft guns trained on your ship. You continue to descend, and as you come within a reasonable distance, you get another notification- you're being scanned. As soon as the scan completes, you watch the AAA guns cease to lock on to your ship, and begin scanning the skies once more.
			`The automatic landing gear extend, and you touch down on the landing pad. After you complete your post-flight checks, you leave your ship and meet John outside. He beckons you to follow, with a sly smile. As you follow a similar pattern of security checks and descending elevators as the last facility.`
			`Eventually, you reach another white shiny room full of tech far beyond your understanding, half of which looks like it would disintegrate you with a mere fraction of its possible power. In the middle of it all is a stairway, which John escorts you down. At the bottom is a large bay in which the largest torpedo you have ever seen rests. Pulsing with a radioactive green energy, you wonder what sorcery these crazy scientists have concocted up now. However, you soon discover it is not sorcery, but just another powerful bomb. John begins explaining how much more advanced this weapon is than the atom bombs of old, but soon you zone out. He continues for a few more minutes but notices your eyes glazing over, and apologizes for taking so long. He then gives you your instructions.`
				`"For this assignment, we will need you to escort a ship from the Syndicate to Valhalla. We have built a number of the prototype torpedoes, but we need a few more items for the launcher.

Thankfully, the Auxiliary has survived without major damage, and after a short inspection, Syndicate dockworkers begin loading it up with heavily armored crates with large warning symbols on it. This crate would likely have caused cancer in California. After an short wait, the load is complete, and you head to the bridge to prepare your ship.

			`Radioing the tower for your clearance, you are directed to a more out of the way set of pads, around a set of office buildings and warehouses. Sitting around the buildings, occupying most of the pads, lie a series of Deep ships: a Bactrian, two Mules (one of which is pockmarked and scarred, it is likely the one used in the weapons tests you took part in,) several Scouts, an Aerie, and a Flivver, which you recognize to be John's, and a full complement of fighters. In fact, you think to yourself, a veritable fleet is resting here- you wonder what they may be up to.`

An automated voice requests you to present your pilot's license and i.d. card for scanning, as a reader presents itself out of the wall. After a moment of fishing for them in your pockets, you present them, and shortly you hear a little beep and a click as the door in front of you unlocks and opens on its own.

The clerk is a middle-aged woman with a smile who asks you in a kind voice for your name and appointment, and at the name "John Withers," she smiles and says "Right this way Lt. Commander." She leads you up a short flight of stairs and to a glass office with a full window. The view is splendid, you are able to see both the old and new yards, and you imagine watching the new ships roll out every day, climbing up through the clouds to the sun.`
