DEPRECATED
MANY OF THESE EVENTS HAVE BEEN CHANGED OR EDITED
FILE IS KEPT FOR BRAINSTORMING REASONS- DO NOT REFERENCE


Outline:
Enlistment
#	-Kill Pirate ship currently leviathan, probably should become a smaller ship, possibly a raven or scout
>>>>>		[MIKE: Leviathans are tricky to take on without at least Squirrel Tech (which new players may not necessarily be aware of). Highly suggest dropping down to a Raven - Scout would probably be a bit too generous.]
	-Escort freighters
Early Work
	-More escorting (materials for electron beams)
	-Observe a test battle between a pair of ravens (laser and electron) and see which disables first, then report to the engineer
	-More escorting freighters (materials for typhoons)
	-Second mock battle
>>>>>		[MIKE: Suggest having the Typhoon target being roughly medium-warship sized - like a Manta (maybe even a Firebird, but those can be rather beefy)]
	-More escorting (materials for ramscoops)
#	-rebuild geminus
>>>>>		[MIKE: I'd suggest missions from (or to) Bounty in Delta Velorum or New Wales in Algorel as far as materials to rebuild Geminus - both planets are noted for having heavy metals and other materials needed for construction.]
	-event mk ii navy (available in shipyards)
Involvement in the war
	-payment to buy cruiser (or maybe a gunboat at this stage, idk yet) [source:geminus] & navy license
#	-first battle (kornephoros) NEED BETTER DIALOGUE!!!
>>>>>		[MIKE: Kornephoros surrenders to the Republic without a fight in the FW storyline - resistance should either be light or nonexistent. This would also be where Katya gets captured, so having <first> be the one to bring her in would be the way to go. The first battle the FW has is actually in Sabik, not Kornephoros.]
	-planting sensors on hope and sensors on other planets (need exact ones from the FW campaign)
>>>>>		[MIKE: I've combed most of the mission text and there doesn't seem to be any mention of sensors being installed other than the one on Hope. However, New Iceland in Kaus Borealis, New Wales in Algorel and New Austria in Menkent have bases constructed on them in the wake of being routed in Sabik.] 
	-go on unsuccessful investigation of martini stock exchange
>>>>>		[MIKE: Poisonwood gets invaded by the Alphas right about here in the FW storyline; this would also tie in nicely with being reassigned to Danforth and the Oathkeepers.]
Next stage
#	-Reassigned to Danforth, where do constant bounty missions, (must have a cruiser at this time)
>>>>>		[MIKE: Making the Cruiser a requirement would probably be detrimental, especially for veterans who most likely would fly Shield Beetles or other ships by this point.]
#	-finally do recon missions, and head back to the south
#	-battleship sequence by quarg block
	-get carrier loan
FW ATTACK
#	-FW attack, must reconfigure to end at sabik, then discover FW not the badguys
SYNDICATE DRAMA
	-go attack syndicate, then pug surprise attack in the middle of fighting the synd
>>>>>		[MIKE: The Syndicate Extremists should show up roughly in the middle of the assault on the Syndicate (but before the Pug). And that's where we get introduced to nukes.]
#	-after pug are defeated, go to Hephaestus and get JD and go investigate the pug on deneb, then get the navy fleet and attack the pug, open links, and finally defeat the pug
	-diplomacy with synd
	-defeat the alpha extremists
DIPLOMACY
	-go do diplomacy with free worlds
	-interrupted by massive pirate attacks everywhere, and alphas present in poisonwood with a carrier, dont let it get away
>>>>>		[MIKE: Is the plan to have Poisonwood invaded again, or would the previous note override this?]
	-zug shipyards destroyed by alphas
	-exterminate the pirates and alphas with the help of the FW
	-help the FW rebuild zug shipyards
	-closing
	-the end
	-epilogue missions set up to happen at least a month later, up to a year later
