The next systems we need scanned are Almaaz and Unagi - as you'll be passing by Freedom, which is well-known for its anarchy, this mission is beyond what most other merchants would be comfortable with...and as a result, the payment will also be substantially more.

			`	While there are scant few establishments to begin with, the Stardust Pub appears to be one of the more popular places to eat, judging by the crowd at the entrance. Among those gathered, you notice, and subsequently join, Admiral Danforth; however, his expression is one that you can only describe as "hesistant."`
			`	"You've done a fantastic job so far, Ensign <last>," he begins, looking straight ahead, "and I need your talents once more. We're sending you straight into the heart of the Northern Pirates to track their fleet presence in Arneb, Alnilam and Hatsya. I won't lie to you - even most Navy recruits tend to be wary operating so remotely, and you will be compensated appropriately."`

			`	Danforth smiles broadly. "We need more men and women like you in the Navy, Ensign - you certainly are a rare breed. Come on. My treat," he says, as he walks into the pub.`
			`	The two of you are shown a table along one of the walls of the Stardust. Just from what you see, it's clear the owners wanted their patrons to feel more like they were part of civilization, not on a barren rock as far away as one could be from it. After the waitstaff takes your orders, Danforth makes a couple glances left and right before he addresses you.`
			`	"You probably guessed it already, but there's an ulterior motive to meet here, <last>. I've been reviewing the logs you collected, and what I'm seeing bothers me. So far, it doesn't look like much has changed in the level of activity we're used to seeing in those systems - frankly, if anything, there's actually been *less* activity in those systems. You know that old saying: 'It's quiet. *Too* quiet.'"`
			`	"Yeah," you agree, looking slightly downward as you put a hand to your chin. "It feels like the calm before the storm."`
			`	"Indeed. They're planning something...but what, I don't know. Hopefully this last round of scanning will clear things up."`
			`A moment later, the waitstaff bring your meals to you and the two of you begin eating. As the two of you continue idle banter, you realize that not many officers usually have such a personal relationship with Admirals - Danforth is truly a rarity among them. Even though he far outranks you, he still insists on paying the bill for both of you. "One thing I've learned over the years," he comments, "is what actually being an Admiral entails. It's not just about the medals you earned and the battles you fought to reach this position - it's also the relationships you build and the friends you make along the way. Anyone can give orders, but if you only see your men as expendable resources, all those stars, medals and badges don't mean a damned thing."`
			`	"That's the other reason I brought you here, <last>," he adds while the two of you exit the Stardust. "I wanted to make it clear that just because I have a higher rank, that does *not* mean I should also feel superior to you. We're both humans, and on that note, equals. I'm sure my actions have proved as much, but my position does *not* give me the right to treat you like dirt, and any Admiral who tells you otherwise is either delusional, drunk, a liar or an idiot. Or all of the above."`
			`The two of you laugh for a second at his comment. "Anyway," he continues, "just like before, there's no need to engage any hostiles on your patrol. Just beware of Zenith and Haven - considering their locations, they're fairly well-guarded. Report back to me with the logs, and I'll personally make sure that you'll receive 250,000 credits for your work. Furthermore...I'm going to put in a good word on possibly getting you promoted straight to Lieutenant-grade."`
			`	"That is very gracious of you, sir," you reply with a nod. "And thank you for taking the time to talk to me - I promise you, I won't let you down."`
			`	"I know you won't, Ensign. Good luck, and God Bless."`

			`When you come in for a landing, you can't help but feel like something's wrong. Just from how remote Farpoint is, the activity in the base usually rather low. But now the hangars are swarming with crews and ships ready to take off. In addition, unlike most times when you might have to wait up to 20 minutes to land, the control tower gives you clearance almost immediately. For you to be moved to the front of the line so quickly, while certainly a nice change of pace, also sends a slight twinge of dread down your spine...which soon proves to be well-founded.`
			`	You quickly disembark the <ship> to find Danforth's aide waiting for you. The two of you quickly hurry to the Admiral's quarters, and find he's joined by other Navy officers. As you enter the room, instictively saluting as you do so, all eyes shift away from the table and towards you - and the looks you receive, in particular Danforth's, make you feel uneasy.`
			`	"Ensign <last>, your timing is impeccable," Danforth says. "We just obtained your sensor logs, and it may have just been enough to prevent things from getting worse."`
			`	"...Worse, sir?" you ask, cautiously.`
			`	"Indeed," one of the officers says. "Shit well and truly hit the fan right as you got here."`
			`	"Hines, please," Danforth exasperatedly shushes the officer, raising his hand. "Just as we finished downloading your logs, a pirate fleet suddenly warped in. Most of them were either destroyed or routed back into the North, but one ship managed to escape. Most of us believe it's thanks to your sensor logs that we were able to halt their advance as much as we did."`
			`	"Even so, that one ship is now running amok amongst the systems South of us," another officer adds. "We could have done more if we'd-"`
			`	"We did as much as we could," you interrupt, silencing the room. "None of us could have possibly anticipated, let alone prepared for anything more than what those logs indicated."`
			`Most of the officers quietly talk amongst themselves at your response, but Hines keeps staring you down. You don't know why, but it seems like he feels threatened by you speaking as though you were a higher rank than he was.`
			`	"Ensign <last>, at ease," Danforth finally says as he stands up from behind his desk. "We can go over the details later in the spaceport," he adds, walking towards you. "In the meantime, here's your payment of 250,000 credits, as promised."`

Unlike your previous stay at <source>, where you would have struggled to have found a speck of dust in the mess hall, Fourth Port is a testament to the Syndicate's standards: warehouses of rusted sheetmetal, towering metal smokestacks that belching caustic ash, and barrels containing a disgusting yellowish liquid you can only hope are cleaning chemicals and not...something else.`

			`	"Take 'em," Hadley eagerly replies. He heads back to the file cabinet and procures a few holodisks - likely security footage of the event. "You'll need these, too, if you want to prove your claims; plus, if Hines comes here again, he won't find anything on me."`
			`As the two of you make your way back to the docks, you can't help but notice how much the fellow has changed from your initial encounter. What started off as an argument that could have spiraled out of control has ended with a potential ally. "You know, I don't think I ever got your name," you say. "Mine's <first> <last>."`
			`"Lucas Hadley," he replies. "Did you really mean what you said, <last>?"`
			`	"Every word, Hadley. I'll be sure to mention your plight to my superiors - I don't know if they'll be able to do anything about it, but I refuse to let this lie. Hines needs to answer for his actions."`

			`	"Actually, sir...there is."`
			`Danforth raises an eyebrow. "Alright, I'm listening."`
			`	"I met a dockworker at Lodestone named Lucas Hadley. He says that Hines stopped by about a month ago to pick up some materials for the base at New Iceland - is that true?"`
			`"Let me see," Danforth says, checking his computer. It takes a moment, but he eventually finds his calendar. "Ah, yes. I had sent him out to pick up some framulators for the base. Though I'm curious, <first>...why do you ask?"`
			`You glance over your shoulder, even though there's no-one who could possibly see you. "Admiral, Hines apparently *decked* Hadley because the latter offended his twisted sense of honor."`
			`"What?!?" he exclaims, visibly shocked. "Lieutenant, this is a *very* serious accusation you're making," he warns, gravely. "I hope you have evidence to substantiate your claim."`
			`"One step ahead of you, Admiral," you say as you reach inside your vest. "Hadley provided these photos and holotapes to document the whole event."`
			`	"Wait," the admiral says. He presses a button on his desk, to which you suddenly hear numerous locking sounds. "Don't want to take any chances, <first> - I've locked all points of access so we can't be disturbed."`
			`	"Pretty slick, admiral," you reply, impressed. "Now...you need to see these."`
			`Danforth looks over the photos Hadley gave you, a grim expression on his face as he reviews the events of that day. After he's seen enough, he takes one of the holotapes and plays the security feeds. To your great surprise, the holotapes even have audio - normally, the cost of having audio on security cameras is seen as unnecessary, and too expensive. Listening to Hines threaten Hadley sends both a deep chill of terror and a burning demand for justice down your spine. In that one moment, any doubts Hines was a potential risk to the Republic were gone.`
			`After watching the tapes, all Danforth can do is sigh and sadly shake his head. "The man has well and truly lost his mind."`
			`"Admiral," you begin, "Hadley's in danger. I made a promise to him that I would get his family to safety. And I have no intention on breaking that promise. But what are we going to do about Hines?"`
			`"Leave Hines to me," Danforth replies. "Obviously, we can't do anything right now - Hines is a Lieutenant Commander, which is roughly the naval equivalent of a Major in the Marines. For us to publicly go after someone that far up the chain, people would start asking questions, and Hines would almost certainly suspect Hadley." Danforth opens a secure drawer in his desk, puts the photos and tapes inside, and locks the drawer. "As far as Hadley's family, unfortunately, it will have to wait - we need to keep the supply chain moving. However, the moment we have a lull in the action, I'll send you off to fulfill your promise to Hadley."`
			`Danforth then does a bit more clicking and typing on his computer. "This information you've provided is invaluable, Lieutenant. You may well have just saved a man's life today, and for that, it's only fitting that you are rewarded." Your communicator suddenly beeps, to which you see an email from your bank account - another 1.5 million credits have been deposited into it from the Navy. Smiling warmly, you look back to the admiral. "That is very gracious of you sir. Thank you."`
			`	"It's the least I could do, Lieutenant," he nods, smiling proudly. "Now, then. We have some troops and materiél that need to be delivered - the auxiliaries ought to be fully-retrofitted for the trip."`
			label end
			`Walking back out of the admiral's quarters, you find the auxiliaries in their "hybrid" configuration - perfect for the retrieval of the new recruits and base defenses. After a brief meeting with the captains of the auxiliaries, you make your way back to <ship> and prepare for takeoff.`

Not wanting to waste this opportunity, you continue your psychological strike and move in close to his face with a glare - enough that he actually leans back in mild shock.`

But I'm only going to warn you *once* - come at me like this again, and I will *not* hesitate to report your threatening of me to Danforth. Just because you outrank me doesn't mean I'm not going to stand up for myself. Now if you don't mind...*please* get out of my way."`

It looks like Hines is starting to get suspicious about that man, possibly because I've started to take action against Ranulph any way I can. Small ways like decreased pay, pointless assignments that keep him away from the front, that sort of thing. But despite my best efforts to make the actions seem as innocuous as possible, I fear Ranulph may have figured out what's going on. For the time being, keep performing your duties escorting the auxiliaries to their destinations - hopefully we'll be able to perform our rescue mission soon. I'll reach out again once I have an update."`

			`Upon landing on New Iceland, you are once again contacted by Commodore Cruz - but instead of joy, his voice is filled with concern.`

			`"Captain <last>, well done on securing a foothold in Free Worlds territory. As much as we would like to capitalize on our gains, there are some other matters we need to attend to."`
			`	"Why? What's wrong?" you ask, confused.`
			`	"Have a look at this."`
			``
			`Your primary display changes to show a newsreel of several Syndicate ships in orbit above Earth. On many of the ships, your eyes are drawn to launchers that are several times the size of any missile or rocket launcher - even torpedo tubes wouldn't come close to that size.`
			`	"Yesterday, a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit above Earth - it wasn't long before we determined that the ships were armed with multiple nuclear warheads, and began issuing demands.`
			`	(Wait...armed with WHAT?!) you think to yourself.`
			`Suddenly, new ships materialize out of nowhere in a haze of bluish particles and surround the Syndicate ships. The new ships are almost organic in their designs - the best description you can give likens them to yellow-colored coral. "Only a few hours after the fleet's arrival, the fleet of unknown alien design you see appeared, apparently using hyperdrives like those possessed by the Quarg. And as soon as they arrived..."`
			`Right as Cruz narrates, the unknown ships open fire on the Syndicate fleet with their weapons, and reduce the Syndicate ships to little more than drifting hulks. And as swiftly as they appeared, the unknown ships vanish, and the feed goes dead.`
			``
			`	"This is where things get troubling. As soon as the unknown fleet left, the hyperlanes to several Syndicate systems just...disappeared along with them. It's like the systems never even existed in the first place."`
			``
			`You do your best to process all that just happened, but it's impossible. First, the Syndicate sends a fleet of nuclear-capable warships to Earth with the (likely) intent to demand Parliament gives complete control over to the Syndicate. Then an alien race unlike any you've seen before suddenly materializes and annihilates the Syndicate ships. Now, Cruz says that the ability to travel to Syndicate worlds has been blocked? At this point, you wouldn't be surprised if Cruz went on to mention that pigs can fly and dragons are real.`
			``
			`Rather than potentially go insane trying to make sense of it all, you refocus on the here and now and ask:`
			`	"What are my orders, Commodore?"`
			`"First, High Command needs you to report back to Luna - a Syndicate ambassador will be present to meet and accompany you to Syndicate space. You are to then investigate the systems near those severed from the known hyperlanes, and see if a 'backdoor' to the lost systems exists - possibly through the uninhabited systems to the galactic north of Syndicate space. I would give you more information, Captain <last>, but none exists. For now, report back to Luna and meet with the ambassador - we'll discuss our next move after a meeting with the Syndicate."`

#### I should note that this is just the edited dialogue from Michael Zahniser's "FW Pug 2B" mission from the reconciliation branch. (because this was too hard for me to write and supposed to have the exact same outcome)

The moment you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you to their headquarters, culminating with the arrival at the extravagantly-furnished (perhaps even disgustingly-so) office of Alastair Korban - the CEO of the entire Syndicate Corporation.`

				`	"If it isn't you, then who is it?"`

			`	Alastair says, "That terrorism was the action of a certain extremist faction that we have since purged from our ranks, and we were in the process of hunting down the perpetrators."`

				`	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
				`	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
					goto who
			
			`	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
			label who
			`	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
			`	"How do you know this?" asks John.`
			`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
			choice

					goto anger
				`	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`

			`	"Assuming you're telling the truth," you say, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
			`	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
			choice

					goto deal

If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`

You look over each and every one of them, doing your best to engrave their faces into your memory - you solemnly realize that it might be the last time you ever see them again. After some brief introductions, you are formally introduced:`
			``
			`		Captain Thomas Fairchild, of the R.N.S Fortitude...`
			`		Rear Admiral Sophia Icke, of the R.N.S. Matterhorn...`
			`		Commander Minako Tsubachi of the R.N.S. Itokawa...`
			`		Commodore Elena Antonova of the R.N.S. Aleksandr...`
			`		Captain Piotr Blazkowicz of the R.N.S. Krakow...`
			`		And Admiral William "Billy" Taggart of the R.N.S. Incontrovertible.`
			``
			`"Right," you begin, "well, it's time to address the crews of our ships." You quickly exit the room, COs in tow, and make your way to the main hangar. There must be close to a thousand men and women gathered here, all busily working to get the ships ready.`
			`	Near your arrival point, a small podium has been set up for your final briefing. As you step up to the microphone, some feedback squawks through the speakers, to which an audio tech quickly remedies. Once the feedback is dealt with, you bark: "All crews, fallll IN!"`
			`	Immediately, all officers and enlisted stop what they're doing and form ranks in front of the podium. The whole experience feels like something out of a movie as you begin the briefing, your voice echoing throughout the hangar...`
			`	"This is it, ladies and gentlemen - the complete and total surrender of the Syndicate is all but inevitable. Only a few desperate holdouts remain, and it comes down to us to finalize our victory."`
			`	You turn to your right and slowly begin to pace back and forth in front of the officers and their crews. "We know what's at stake here. To fail now would be a fatal blow for the Republic - not just for morale, but for our people. Our united citizens, Republic and Free Worlds, alike, are looking to us for guidance...and for hope. Hope that we will see another tomorrow. Hope that we will rise from the ashes of this war far stronger than when we started. And hope that we can finally rest, peacefully, safe from all that would seek to destroy that which we value above all else: our freedom."`
			`	"I won't sugar-coat any of this - it's quite possible that when we come back to this hangar, there may be some faces and ships absent. The average citizen in the Republic, never mind the Free Worlds, may never even know of your existence."`
			``
			`You stop, and turn to face the group.`
			``
			`	"But the enemy...the enemy will know. Through our courage and tenacity, we will forever carve an image of ourselves into the hearts and minds of the enemy. We will burn so bright that when even the last lights in the Universe wink out of existence, the enemy will still know of our actions, and never forget the scars of our heroism they experienced. And with this knowledge, we board our ships knowing that defeat is impossible for us, men - we have already claimed victory!"`
			``
			`		"LONG LIVE THE REPUBLIC!"`
			``
			`You move as one unit towards your respective ships, filled with a renewed sense of vigor. As you board the <ship>, you take one last look skyward - to your surprise, there's a rare break in the otherwise thick cloud cover, and the star casts a brilliant light over the spaceport. A warm smile breaks across your face...it almost feels like the heavens themselves are blessing you on your journey.`
			`	Cycling the hatch, you make final preparations before setting out to <destination>...and destiny.`
