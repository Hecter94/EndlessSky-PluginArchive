			`	As your <ship> slows its landing descent, you glance out the window to see a massive fleet gathered in the spaceport and around it, what you estimate is about a dozen cruisers, a couple carriers, and an absurd quantity of smaller ships and fighters. Moments later, your ship thuds down on the platform with a pleasant hiss, and you head for the airlock. Walking down the boarding ramp you are greeted by a waiting officer.`
			`	"Commander! If you would follow me, Commodore Cruz wishes to see you in his briefing room."
			`	You follow the officer, and soon find yourself seated in a room with several dozen officers. You can't help but notice that Hines is sitting in the back with a dark look on his face. You also notice that he does not seem to grow any happier by your presence. You look forward in the room and brush him out of your mind, and you focus on the Commodore as he prepares to ascend to the podium and give the briefing. Cruz is a burly man, Hispanic and in his late 60's, although he does not seem to be affected by such a number. His chest is remarkably large, and he has a short and dense silver beard and moustache that is well kept. His eyes are small, but gleam with the experience and an ever-analyzing aura that is to be expected of an accomplished tactician such as he. You watch as he straightens out his military jacket, and steps up to the dais.
			`	"Gentlemen," he says, "This is the moment. It has finally happened. War. War is terrible, and I do not relish sacrificing lives for a supposed glory. There is little glory in war. Some of us may not survive the next few days. However, we must not dwell on that. We have a mission. We have honor to uphold. We have our comrades, in this room, their lives to uphold."
			`	"Our mission is to get to the planet Deep's surface. There is a mid-sized defense fleet in orbit that we must evade. Once on the surface we will confront the planet authorities with the evidence that the Geminus Investigation has produced, and hopefully force a surrender of the system. Our route will be a short one- head south-west through Wei, and then south to Kornephoros. It is only a two-day trip, but do not linger in the intermediary systems, save your ammunition. We will be there a short while, but we expect retaliatory action and we need to be as conservative as possible until we decide our next courses of action."`
			`	"As I will be conducting the negotiations, (as per Parliament's orders,) your goal is to hold off the defenders until I can get to the surface. Commander <last> and his fleet will run escort for me and the rest of you will hold a perimeter in space. My ship is the R.N.S. Victory. Any questions?"`

				`	"Sir, what is the evidence we have?"`
			`	"Apparently the Free Worlds tested a nuclear device, with a nearly identical signature as to the one used on Geminus, on the mining world of Clink, which is a moon orbiting and under the authority of Deep."
			`	This sparks gasps and remarks of anger in the assembled officers as they depart the room, and you head back to your ship to get some sleep.`

The Intelligence bureau has identified that the signature of the blast on Geminus matches the signature of a test site on your moon, Clink. Therefore, I request that you order a ceasefire, and surrender control of the system to the Republic."`

Horizon, and through the ship's white interior hallways to the captain's cabin. You enter following the Commodore, and he presses a button and sits down as the door hisses shut and seals with the squeak of an airlock.`
			`	"Have a seat, Commander." He says, gesturing to the chair in front of the desk. You sit down and he continues:"`
			`	"<last>, as you know the moon of Clink is the actual supposed site of testing, and the Investigation is sure of it. However as somewhat a formality and somewhat for a corroborating account, we have been asked to get scans and samples of any and all sites that we can locate here.`
			`	"The moon has been locked down since we entered the system, and right now Intelligence personnel are filtering through the population to find potential suspects or involved members. In any case, we should with all haste proceed there to search for the evidence around the moon. We should be able to take samples and readings by the time Intelligence is finished, at which point we can lift the lockdown and let the private captains or other personnel continue operations. But it is important that we finish our task before restrictions are lifted to prevent any chances of unwanted questions from inquisitive captains.`
			`	"How are we going to take the data?" You ask.`
			`Cruz presses a button and then spins his monitor around. The monitor shows the R.N.S. Victory's drone bays- which are surprisingly loaded with surveillance drones as opposed to combat drones.`

			`After the short journey up and over to Clink you make your landing, dodging several meteors in the process. You set your ship down outside a mining outpost, with Cruz's cruiser right behind. The Victory does not touch down, however: you watch as doors in the bottom of the hull slide open, and a blue light inside begins to glow. The light grows to a point until with a clunk the four surveillance drones drop out, and a second later their own repulsors kick in, and they stop mid-air and then slowly ascend into a line on both sides of the cruiser.`
			choice
				`You are hailed by Commodore Cruz.`
			`	"Commander- I am ready. I have sent the search pattern to your ship's computer, and we can proceed whenever you want. I will be running with the drones at five hundred meters, you hold guard at fifteen hundred. Just use your guns to hit any significant asteroids or meteors that are headed toward the drones, they need to hold pattern to get proper readings, and remember that the drones are unshielded. Radio me when you are ready.`
			choice
				`	"Ready sir."`
			`You watch as Cruz and the drones turn and begin accelerating. You quickly take off and follow, ascending to the altitude he requested.`
#want to get a scene of flying over the surface...
			`The flight is uneventful, taking about half the day. For a planet with so many frequent impacts, very few asteroids actually pose a threat. Several come close to hitting the cruisers, but only a handful end up coming close to the drones, and your lasers easily deal with them. The only sparks in the trip come about a third of the way in, where Cruz lets you know that the drones located a significant source of radiation around one particularly normal and inconspicuous crater.`
			``
			`Finally, many hours later, you have made a full trail around the whole globe, and you and Cruz head back to the outpost where you started.`
			`You land, and immediately technicians race out and begin refueling the two ships, and you both head inside. You pass through the lines of people receiving inspections and searches from Intelligence personnel, and the officers salute the Commodore and yourself. It suddenly occurs to you that if you had not taken those contracting missions what seems so long ago now, you could have been standing with no choice in those lines instead of being led past them by officers. Eventually you reach an office which has been converted into a...room of sorts. There is a two way mirror in one part of the room keeping Navy people hidden and the other side has a chair leaned back, and a woman is lying down with many leads attached to her, monitoring her vitals, heart rate, brain activity, eye movement, hormone levels, and more. Bright lights shine down on her, blinding her to what is happening around her, and the rest of the room is darkened. The Navy people turn out to be a mixture of mostly Navy Intelligence (unsurprisingly) and a few high-ranking officers. Hines is there as well. They seem to be asking questions, and they do not seem to be liking her answers. As you approach with Cruz you catch some sentence fragments, muffled through the door.`
			`	"...Free Worlds testing site!
			`	"We had just...ourselves, and that is why I was there, to attempt...more information which couldn't be gotten with captain...here," the woman seems to calmly respond. I would not have recruited...unless...innocent.`
			`The woman's responses are much harder to hear, as she sounds calm and patient. Suddenly you hear a very recognizable voice scream:`
			`	"And yet there is a damned nuclear site on your moon, and a council member hiding out there! Sounds to me like you were orchestrating a cover up you conniving-"`
			`The distinct condescending scream of Hines drops out with a jump, as if he has been grabbed, and the door quickly opens. A man you do not recognize who bears the four stars of Admiral, walks out holding Hines' arm, and angrily whispering, "Lieutenant Commander you will wait your turn to speak and if and when you are permitted it shall be something sensible and not emotions leading your tongue. Do not ever think you supersede the order of things; this is not your interrogation." He casts Hines' arm away and turns to reenter the room, but holds the door for you.

			`	"What are you looking at, sucker," Hines says with a sneer as he marches past you." You glance at Commodore Cruz, who is staring right at you. You meet eyes for a second and they tell you many emotions, all of which you share. He nods at you and you keep walking.`
			`You follow the Commodore into the room and watch the rest of the interrogation. The questions are pretty much all similar to what you heard before, with all of them designed to try to trip the woman up, but her story remains congruent. At one point the Intelligence officers borrow the information you collected with the Commodore, and bring it up, but the reactions stay the same. Finally they decide they cannot get anywhere useful with her and they motion for you to come closer. In hushed voices the higher ranking officers discuss their plan, and then decide what needs to be done. They turn to you and ask:`
			`	"Commander, you are a trustworthy captain, and have much experience with these types of missions. You will escort a prisoner convoy carrying this prisoner-of-war and others back to Huginn Station in the Deep, the location of Navy Intelligence's interrogation and prisoner facilities, by <deadline>. This convoy is incredibly important, and must be protected at all costs. There will be other escort ships, but although they amount to a sizeable fleet, do not in any way consider yourself safe. Good luck, and fare well."`
			`You salute and turn to leave, and Commodore Cruz gives you a casual salute and a wink. "Stay safe Commander," he says.`

I have been instructed to go to Luna to meet with a Syndicate ambassador...and hopefully make sense of this whole mess."

			`Upon landing on New Iceland, you are once again contacted by Commodore Cruz - but instead of joy, his voice is filled with concern.`
			``
			`"Captain <last>, well done on securing a foothold in Free Worlds territory. As much as we would like to capitalize on our gains, there are some other matters we need to attend to."`
			`	"Why? What's wrong?" you ask, confused.`
			`	"Have a look at this."`
			`Your primary display changes to show a newsreel of several Syndicate ships in orbit above Earth. On many of the ships, your eyes are drawn to launchers that are several times the size of any missile or rocket launcher - even torpedo tubes wouldn't come close to that size.`
			`	"Yesterday, a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit above Earth - it wasn't long before we determined that the ships were armed with multiple nuclear warheads, and began issuing demands.`
			`	(Wait...armed with nukes?!) you think to yourself.`
			`Suddenly, new ships materialize out of nowhere in a haze of bluish particles and surround the Syndicate ships. The new ships are almost organic in their designs - the best description you can give likens them to yellow-colored coral. "Only a few hours after the fleet's arrival, the fleet of unknown alien design you see appeared, apparently using hyperdrives like those possessed by the Quarg. And as soon as they arrived..."`
			`Right as Cruz narrates, the unknown ships open fire on the Syndicate fleet with their weapons, and reduce the Syndicate ships to little more than drifting hulks. And as swiftly as they appeared, the unknown ships vanish, and the feed goes dead.`
			``
			`	"This is where things get troubling. As soon as the unknown fleet left, the hyperlanes to several Syndicate systems just...disappeared along with them. It's like the systems never even existed in the first place."`
			``
			`You do your best to process all that just happened, but it's impossible. First, the Syndicate sends a fleet of nuclear-capable warships to Earth with the (likely) intent to demand Parliament gives complete control over to the Syndicate. Then an alien race unlike any you've seen before suddenly materializes and annihilates the Syndicate ships. Now, Cruz says that the ability to travel to Syndicate worlds has been blocked? At this point, you wouldn't be surprised if Cruz went on to mention that pigs can fly and dragons are real.`
			``
			`Rather than potentially go insane trying to make sense of it all, you refocus on the here and now and ask:`
			`	"What are my orders, Commodore?"`
			`"First, High Command needs you to report back to Luna - a Syndicate ambassador will be present to meet and accompany you to Syndicate space. You are to then investigate the systems near those severed from the known hyperlanes, and see if a 'backdoor' to the lost systems exists - possibly through the uninhabited systems to the galactic north of Syndicate space. I would give you more information, Captain <last>, but none exists. For now, report back to Luna and meet with the ambassador - we'll discuss our next move after a meeting with the Syndicate."`

#### I should note that this is just the edited dialog from Michael Zahniser's "FW Pug 2B" mission from the reconciliation branch. (because this was too hard for me to write and supposed to have the exact same outcome)

				`	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
				`	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
					goto who
			
			`	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
			label who
			`	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
			`	"How do you know this?" asks John.`
			`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"Did it not occur to you that attacking the Korath might anger other alien species?"`
					goto anger
				`	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`

				goto help
			
			label help
			`	"Assuming you're telling the truth," you say, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
			`	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
			choice
				`	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
					goto deal
			label deal
			`	"Hold on," John says, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`
