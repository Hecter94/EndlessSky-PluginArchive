After she scans it, she directs you to a specific hangar in the rear area of the shipyards.`

			`	As your <ship> slows its landing descent, you glance out the window to see a massive fleet gathered in the spaceport and around it, what you estimate is about a dozen cruisers, a couple carriers, and an absurd quantity of smaller ships and fighters. Moments later, your ship thuds down on the platform with a pleasant hiss, and you head for the airlock. Walking down the boarding ramp you are greeted by a waiting officer.`
			`	"Commander! If you would follow me, Commodore Cruz wishes to see you in his briefing room."
			`	You follow the officer, and soon find yourself seated in a room with several dozen officers. You can't help but notice that Hines is sitting on the back with a dark look on his face. You also notice that he does not seem to grow any happier by your presence. You look forward in the room and brush him out of your mind, and you focus on the Commodore as he prepares to ascend to the podium and give the briefing. Cruz is a burly man, Hispanic and in his late 60's, although he does not seem to be affected by such a number. His chest is remarkably large, and he has a short and dense silver beard and moustache that is well kept. His eyes are small, but gleam with the experience and an ever-analyzing aura that is to be expected of an accomplished tactician such as he. You watch as he straightens out his military jacket, and steps up to the dais.
			`	"Gentlemen," he says, "This is the moment. It has finally happened. War. War is terrible, and I do not relish sacrificing lives for a supposed glory. There is little glory in war. Some of us may not survive the next few days. However, we must not dwell on that. We have a mission. We have honor to uphold. We have our comrades, in this room, their lives to uphold."
			`	"Our mission is to get to the planet Deep's surface. There is a mid-sized defense fleet in orbit that we must evade. Once on the surface we will confront the planet authorities with the evidence that the Geminus Investigation has produced, and hopefully force a surrender of the system. Our route will be a short one- head south-west through Wei, and then south to Kornephoros. It is only a two-day trip, but do not linger in the intermediary systems, save your ammunition. We will be there a short while, but we expect retaliatory action and we need to be as conservative as possible until we decide our next courses of action."`
			`	"As I will be conducting the negotiations, (as per Parliament's orders,) your goal is to hold off the defenders until I can get to the surface. Commander <last> and his fleet will run escort for me and the rest of you will hold a perimeter in space. My ship is the R.N.S. Victory. Any questions?"`
			`The officers in the room respond with a resounding "No sir!" and you say:`
			choice
				`	"No, sir!"`
					goto no
				`	"Sir, what is the evidence we have?"`
			`	"Apparently the Free Worlds tested a nuclear device, with a nearly identical signature as to the one used on Geminus, on the mining world of Clink, which is a moon orbiting and under the authority of Deep."
			`	This sparks gasps and remarks of anger in the assembled officers as they depart the room, and you head back to your ship to get some sleep.`

			`	With the Free Worlds fleet occupied, you and the R.N.S. Victory plunge through the atmosphere down to the island containing the government buildings. Shortly you touch down outside the capital and the Victory sends out a unit of Marines to secure the premises.`
			`	There were few guards around, and most, when they saw themselves outnumbered, surrendured, but a few fought until they were brought down by marine stun blasts. Soon you enter the office of the governor, and Commodore Cruz puts down a datapad on the governor's desk.`
			`	"Governor, here is the evidence. Nuclear blasts have a detectable signature. The Intelligence bureau has identified that the signature of the blast on Geminus matches the signature of a test site on your moon, Clink. Therefore, I request that you order a ceacefire, and surrender control of the system to the Republic."`
			`	The governor stares at the datapad with his head in his hands. "Commodore, I can't believe this. Is what you say really true?"`
			`	"It is, all of it," says Cruz. "I suggest you surrender control of the system before more lives are lost."`

Stranger still, the same nuclear-capable fleet was suddenly vaporized by an alien fleet. I have been instructed to go to Luna to meet with a Syndicate ambassador...and hopefully make sense of this whole mess."
		conversation
			`Upon landing on New Iceland, you are once again contacted by Commodore Cruz - but instead of joy, his voice is filled with concern.`
			``
			`"Captain <last>, well done on securing a foothold in Free Worlds territory. As much as we would like to capitalize on our gains, there are some other matters we need to attend to."`
			`	"Why? What's wrong?" you ask, confused.`
			`	"Have a look at this."`
			`Your primary display changes to show a newsreel of several Syndicate ships in orbit above Earth. On many of the ships, your eyes are drawn to launchers that are several times the size of any missile or rocket launcher - even torpedo tubes wouldn't come close to that size.`
			`	"Yesterday, a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit above Earth - it wasn't long before we determined that the ships were armed with multiple nuclear warheads, and began issuing demands.`
			`	(Wait...armed with nukes?!) you think to yourself.`
			`Suddenly, new ships materialize out of nowhere in a haze of bluish particles and surround the Syndicate ships. The new ships are almost organic in their designs - the best description you can give likens them to yellow-colored coral. "Only a few hours after the fleet's arrival, the fleet of unknown alien design you see appeared, apparently using hyperdrives like those possessed by the Quarg. And as soon as they arrived..."`
			`Right as Cruz narrates, the unknown ships open fire on the Syndicate fleet with their weapons, and reduce the Syndicate ships to little more than drifting hulks. And as swiftly as they appeared, the unknown ships vanish, and the feed goes dead.`
			``
			`	"This is where things get troubling. As soon as the unknown fleet left, the hyperlanes to several Syndicate systems just...disappeared along with them. It's like the systems never even existed in the first place."`
			``
			`You do your best to process all that just happened, but it's impossible. First, the Syndicate sends a fleet of nuclear-capable warships to Earth with the (likely) intent to demand Parliament gives complete control over to the Syndicate. Then an alien race unlike any you've seen before suddenly materializes and annihilates the Syndicate ships. Now, Cruz says that the ability to travel to Syndicate worlds has been blocked? At this point, you wouldn't be surprised if Cruz went on to mention that pigs can fly and dragons are real.`
			``
			`Rather than potentially go insane trying to make sense of it all, you refocus on the here and now and ask:`
			`	"What are my orders, Commodore?"`
			`"First, High Command needs you to report back to Luna - a Syndicate ambassador will be present to meet and accompany you to Syndicate space. You are to then investigate the systems near those severed from the known hyperlanes, and see if a 'backdoor' to the lost systems exists - possibly through the uninhabited systems to the galactic north of Syndicate space. I would give you more information, Captain <last>, but none exists. For now, report back to Luna and meet with the ambassador - we'll discuss our next move after a meeting with the Syndicate."`

		conversation
#### I should note that this is just the edited dialogue from Michael Zahniser's "FW Pug 2B" mission from the reconciliation branch. (because this was too hard for me to write and supposed to have the exact same outcome)
			`As you are coming in for a landing you announce yourself to the spaceport authorities as diplomatic representatives of the Republic. The moment you land, a Syndicate employee meets you and escorts you to their headquarters, culminating with the arrival at the extravagantly-furnished (perhaps even disgustingly-so) office of Alastair Korban - the CEO of the entire Syndicate Corporation.`
			`"I'm very glad you've come," says Alastair. "It seems unlikely that we can defeat this attack unless we work together."`
			`	"Wait," John says, "you're saying this whole thing is not the Syndicate's doing?"`
			`	Alastair seems taken aback. "Of course not. Seal off valuable trade routes? Why would we do that?"`
			choice
				`	"We thought you were walling yourselves off to escape prosecution for putting a nuke fleet in orbit around Earth!"`
				`	"If it isn't you, then who is it?"`
					goto who
			
			`	Alastair says, "That terrorism was the action of a certain extremist faction that we have since purged from our ranks, and we were in the process of hunting down the perpetrators."`
			choice
				`	"I think you're lying. You had years to turn over those extremists, and you did not."`
				`	"Very well. Who is this common foe? You seem to know more than we do."`
					goto who
			
			`	"We are deeply, deeply sorry for the actions of these extremists," says Alastair, "and for our own inaction in turning them in. We had hoped that we could deal with them internally, without it becoming public knowledge that we were connected with them. That was a foolish choice for us to make, and we are more than willing to make whatever reparations you demand."`
			choice
				`	"Okay, we'll deal with that later. For now, tell us everything you know about whoever is attacking you."`
			label who
			`	"They are called the Pug," says Alastair, "an irrational alien species that previously inhabited a single star system in between Syndicate and Republic space. They have since expanded their territory to include all the human systems neighboring their own star, and have essentially made those human worlds into their slaves."`
			`	"How do you know this?" asks John.`
			`	Alastair pauses for a minute as if trying to figure out the best way to explain himself, then says, "One of our ships traveled to the occupied systems, using a jump drive that we... acquired... from another alien species." He seems to realize how unlikely that sounds, and backpedals. "For years we've been dealing with occasional raids from a species called the Korath. As best we can tell, they're nomadic scavengers and pirates who currently inhabit the galactic core. Over the years we have disabled several of their ships and stolen their jump drives."`
			choice
				`	"Did it not occur to you that attacking the Korath might anger other alien species?"`
					goto anger
				`	"Wait, now there are two different alien species involved? Your story is getting even more convoluted and unbelievable."`
					goto convoluted
			
			label anger
			`	"That is unlikely. The equipment we stole from the Korath is most likely something they stole from someone else."`
				goto help
			
			label convoluted
			`	"Yes," he says, "it is a very convoluted mess. Which is why we need your help."`
				goto help
			
			label help
			`	"Assuming you're telling the truth," you say, "what sort of help do you need from us?"`
			`	Alastair says, "We have only seven jump drives, so whatever fleet attacks the Pug can only contain seven ships. Unless the Quarg or someone else will give you more drives, I suppose. So those ships must be stronger than any ship we have here in Syndicate space, because the Pug are very strong. They obliterated our fleet that had been occupying the Sol system, even though that fleet was armed with the majority of our nuclear arsenal."`
			choice
				`	"You're saying you'll provide the jump drives, and we'll provide the ships? Sounds fair enough."`
					goto deal
			label deal
			`	"Hold on," John says, "I have one condition to add. You will give us one of your jump drives immediately. We will install it in our ship and verify that you are telling the truth about the Pug. If you are, we will work together until this threat is dealt with... and once it is dealt with, we will return our attention to bringing every member of the Syndicate who had a hand in those terrorist attacks to justice. That is our best and final offer." You nod in agreement.`
			`	It's clear that Alastair is none too happy about that deal, but he accepts it. "The jump drives are all being kept on Hephaestus," he says. "Our Systems division was trying to discover the secret behind them, with little success. If you travel there, I'll tell them to install one of the drives in your ship."`
