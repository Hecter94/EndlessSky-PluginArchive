			`This is an entirely alien world. The buildings have strangely flowing, tapered shapes not unlike the Pug starships, and from orbit you count dozens of large cities covering a large portion of the land mass. If this were a human world, you would estimate its population at over a billion. You follow one of the Pug ships that is landing, and discover a large spaceport where a surprising number of human merchant ships are parked, in addition to the aliens.`
			`	Elsewhere they have mostly ignored you, but here your ship is quickly approached by a small group of the pale-skinned, delicate aliens. The Pug are oddly proportioned, with long arms and legs but short, barrel-shaped torsos and large heads, and although they only have two legs, their gait is vaguely insectoid. "You came from outside," one of them says. "You are not pledged to the Protectorate. Do you wish to make your vow of loyalty and peacefulness at this time?"`

And we must maintain control of these systems until we are certain that you will not continue fighting if the links are restored."`
			choice
				`	"If you wish us no harm, why did you slaughter the Syndicate fleet?"`
				`	"You have no business invading our space and interfering in our affairs, regardless of your intentions."`
					goto interfere
		
			`	"The fleet that was carrying nuclear weapons, weapons of genocide? The fleet that, when we demanded their surrender, instead attacked us with those weapons? We offered them a place in the Protectorate, but they chose violence instead, and so they perished by violence. That is justice."`
			`	John says, "I still don't understand what makes you think you have the right to interfere in human affairs."`
		
			label interfere
			`	"'Interfere'?" says the alien. "We have 'interfered' many times before, and always you have benefited. If you do not believe us, ask those who live in the place you call the Deep. We helped them defeat the twisted half-human beings that you created in your foolish attempts to improve your race's genetic code. We have helped keep those creatures in check in the centuries since then. And we have helped in many other ways."`
			choice
				`	"What do you want from us in return?"`
				`	"What are you planning to do with these systems you have occupied?"`
			`	"We have brought peace to this region," says the alien, "and we will continue to spread peace until violence has come to an end throughout human space. That is our only desire. All that we ask in return is a portion of the goods your worlds produce, to help offset the cost of watching over and protecting so many human worlds. And after some time, we will again allow human beings autonomous control of certain parts of your territory, when you show yourselves capable of living peacefully."`
			`	"By 'spreading peace,' do you mean occupying more systems?" asks John.`
			`	"We mean bringing an end to your war and your divisions," the alien says. "Those of your worlds and your people who have shown themselves unable to live peacefully, we must govern, to teach them peace. Any who attack us, we must destroy, because we are the bringers of peace, and whoever attacks us is not on the side of peace. And so we will send you back to your people now, to tell them that they have nothing to fear, and that they should await our peace and our protection."`
			`	The aliens appear to think the conversation is over; they walk away and leave you puzzling over what they said. "We should report back to Earth," says John. "This situation is far beyond what we can handle alone."`

You climb up the steps to what looks like an apartment building and find that all the doors are unlocked. Inside one of the living spaces, you explore the different rooms and find that the water fixtures and electricity are working, but a thick layer of dust covers everything. Samuel, meanwhile, is staring at one of the electrical outlets. "<first>," he says, "do you see anything odd about this?"`

			`	Reports begin coming in as the Navy explores the rest of the planet, and they are all finding the same thing: the cities are abandoned, many of them with signs that they were never inhabited in the first place. The first time you visited this planet, you thought it must have a billion inhabitants, but now it seems that its true population was less than a million - all of whom have apparently departed to somewhere beyond the wormhole.`

"Brace for impact and prepare to engage!"

			`	The air is charged with emotion to an almost explosive degree as you make your way to the spaceport to meet with your fellow officers.

Feelings of excitement, pride, anger, sorrow, fear and disgust all intermingle along with many more as you stride forth with determination, remembering all the events that lead up to this moment...`
			``
			`		The bombings of Geminus and Martini...`
			`		The framing of the Free Worlds, and the subsequent war and reconciliation with them...'
			`		And the (albeit brief) war with the Pug.`

			`	It has been a long, hard road to get here. But finally, the end is so close you can almost picture yourself snatching it out of the air with your bare hands. However, there's one last hurdle to conquer before victory can be claimed at last. How fitting, you muse to yourself, that the beginning of the end takes place here...on Geminus.`
			`	The commanding officers are seated around a large meeting table as you enter the room. You look over each and every one of them, doing your best to engrave their faces into your memory - you solemnly realize that it might be the last time you ever see them again.

			``
			`		Captain Thomas Fairchild, of the R.N.S Fortitude...`

			``
			`"Right," you begin, "well, it's time to address the crews of our ships." You quickly exit the room, COs in tow, and make your way to the main hangar. There must be close to a thousand men and women gathered here, all busily working to get the ships ready.`
			`	Near your arrival point, a small podium has been set up for your final briefing. As you step up to the microphone, some feedback squawks through the speakers, to which an audio tech quickly remedies. Once the feedback is dealt with, you bark: "All crews, fallll IN!"`
			`	Immediately, all officers and enlisted stop what they're doing and form ranks in front of the podium. The whole experience feels like something out of a movie as you begin the briefing, your voice echoing throughout the hangar...`
			`	"This is it, ladies and gentlemen - the complete and total surrender of the Syndicate is all but inevitable. Only a few desperate holdouts remain, and it comes down to us to finalize our victory."`
			`	You turn to your right and slowly begin to pace back and forth in front of the officers and their crews. "We know what's at stake here. To fail now would be a fatal blow for the Republic - not just for morale, but for our people. Our united citizens, Republic and Free Worlds, alike, are looking to us for guidance...and for hope. Hope that we will see another tomorrow. Hope that we will rise from the ashes of this war far stronger than when we started. And hope that we can finally rest, peacefully, safe from all that would seek to destroy that which we value above all else: our freedom."`
			`	"I won't sugar-coat any of this - it's quite possible that when we come back to this hangar, there may be some faces and ships absent. The average citizen in the Republic, never mind the Free Worlds, may never even know of your existence."`
			``
			`You stop, and turn to face the group.`
			``
			`	"But the enemy...the enemy will know. Through our courage and tenacity, we will forever carve an image of ourselves into the hearts and minds of the enemy. We will burn so bright that when even the last lights in the Universe wink out of existence, the enemy will still know of our actions, and never forget the scars of our heroism they experienced. And with this knowledge, we board our ships knowing that defeat is impossible for us, men - we have already claimed victory!"`
			``

			``
			`You move as one unit towards your respective ships, filled with a renewed sense of vigor. As you board the <ship>, you take one last look skyward - to your surprise, there's a rare break in the otherwise thick cloud cover, and the star casts a brilliant light over the spaceport.
