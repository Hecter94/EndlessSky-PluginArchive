		conversation
			`As you are walking through the spaceport, you see a crowd of people and go towards them. They are huddled around a loudspeaker, which is repeating the same message over and over. "On behalf of the Republic, the Navy will begin accepting volunteers into commissioned service next week. With the loss of ships in the devastating nuclear attack on our ship yard we need all combat capable ship captains. Volunteers will be paid on a per diem basis. Interested ship captains will be required to prove their worth to earn their place. More information will be provided at a later point in time."`

	planet "Farpoint"
		description `Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry.`
		description `	Lately the Navy base on Farpoint is growing, because it has become the new home of the Navy Oathkeepers, a small branch of the Navy that has sworn to stay uninvolved in the conflict with the Free Worlds.`
