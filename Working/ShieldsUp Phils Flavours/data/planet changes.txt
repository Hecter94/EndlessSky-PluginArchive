planet "Privateer's Haven"
	attributes north 
	landscape land/nasa1
	description `Home to The Shameless Privateer Company, where it is said the founder made a secret deal with a disreputable politician of the time to acquire exclusive rights to the planet. It is often noted though that probably no-one wanted the planet with its out of the way location and the fact it a desert world that features little except for a covering of old ships and equipment acquired over the past few centuries.`
	description `	Viewed suspiciously by all governments and considered by many to be a pirate world, the perception of the company's borderline legal activities is not helped by the location of each of their operations in areas of high pirate activity and the long history of giving their products names designed to appeal to pirates.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is not fancy but serviceable and is obviously built from scrap. As well as the shipyard and outfitter a range of garish shops and bars offer products and services to generally rowdy customers.`

Joked as being the barnacle on the Syndicate's side, it is often speculated as why it is allowed to exist, given the Syndicates known dislike for the company and the old design of its products.`
	spaceport `A junkyard the size of city sprawls outwards from the spaceport which offers very little beyond the shipyard and outfitter.`

	description `Darkstone is a rainy, mountainous planet. The major continents are spidered with rivers and green valleys and a few enterprising settlers have built farming communities here. It is the southern base of operations for the Shameless Privateer's junkyard ship manufacturing.`
	description `	Despite some low-level cynicism and bitterness, the shipyards popularity with pirates creates a solid customer base and the companies known retaliation against on-planet pirate activities keeps residents relatively safe.`
	spaceport `The spaceport and surrounding buildings is rough and poorly maintained, a number of rowdy bars and small shops offer services to customers. Although residents are friendly, customers are discouraged from exploring beyond the area around the spaceport.`

planet Silver
	attributes "near earth" oil
	landscape land/dune5
	description `Eons ago, Silver was a lush tropical world. It is now mostly desert, but large oil deposits remain below the surface. The petrochemicals mined here are refined to produce plastics, fuel for terrestrial vehicles, and some components of medical ointments and antibiotics. The deserts are hot in daylight and surprisingly cool at night, and as a result most settlers live in houses sunk into the ground in regions where there is enough plant cover to keep the dunes from shifting in the wind and slowly burying their dwellings.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is near an oasis. Cactus-like plants and a few palm trees stand as tall as radio towers, on the outskirts. The landing pads are made of concrete, rising several meters above the ground to protect both against the encroaching sand and against flash floods. Under the clear sky and with white sand in all directions, the sunlight is painfully bright, and a large showroom for Silver Manufacturing reflects the sunlight like a beacon. Originally created to manufacture escort ships to protect their private shipments, high demand saw the directors form a seperate company and offer the ships for sale.`
