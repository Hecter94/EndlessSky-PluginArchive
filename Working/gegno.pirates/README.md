### gegno.pirates
<br>
<br>
Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships, gain Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation, open their planets for travel, loot Gegno licenses and create an outfitter/shipyard for all their gear.<br>
<br>
The new government "Gegno Pirates" (hidden till vanilla gegno story is done) inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>
Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher values. Killing like 80 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>
Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br> 
After gaining full reputation for all planets and obtaining all Gegno licenses you get a mission to a new system with all outfitters/shipyards centralized.<br>
