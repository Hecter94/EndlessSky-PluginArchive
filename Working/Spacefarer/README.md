<h1><p align=center>Endless Sky Plugin:<br />Spacefarer</p></h1>

This is a plugin for the free open source game: [Endless Sky][ES].  The theme
song for this plugin is [The Wanderer][the-wanderer].

# Gameplay Mechanics Changes

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin
aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few
constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- One Jump Drive
- Outfits cannot be looted
- Ships cannot be captured

# Extras provided by plugin

- Navy licenses are granted at the end of Free Worlds campaign.  So that Navy
  ships are purchasable by the player.
- Large systems core and double/triple plasma core are available after Remnant
  Cognizance missions.  They are for sale to provide additional build
  flexibility.

# Known issues

- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
- If a player sells their Jump Drive they cannot get it back.  This is
  intentional.
- A player can obtain up to 3 Jump Drives simultaneously.  However, additional
  Jump Drives will be consumed to proceed with story content.  At the end, the
  player would be left with one Jump Drive.

# Development status: Beta

All critical story elements are available.  Necessary outfits are available or
plunderable when a mission calls for it.

- [x] Sheragi (JD granted for retrieving Emerald Sword)
  - [ ] Remove 2nd Jump drive granted during Sheragi campaign.
- [x] Wanderer (JD granted to give to Unfettered)
- [x] Syndicate Checkmate (JD granted to leave Pug space)
- [ ] Clean up old lootable outfits and convert them to missions.
  - [x] Free Worlds Surveillance Pod mission
  - [ ] Wanderer Control Transceiver and Reasoning Node mission
  - [ ] Free Worlds Electron Beam mission
