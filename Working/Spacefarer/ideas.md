# Phase 1

Make game completable with minimum effort.  [Hecter provided some advice for
missions][loot-missions].

# Phase 2

- Add better story elemants around obtaining story-critical items.
- Update some mission requiremetns to trigger in a different order for when a
  player has a jump drive.
- Sheragi: Remove 2 jump drives and add 1?
- Jump drive removed mid-space: you wonder if you ever had a jump drive to begin
  with?  You panic and check your fleet inventory and notice one of your ships

# Phase 3

Other kinds of tweaks?

- Korath Automata will explode 100% of the time after lootable missions
  complete.
- Support generating Endless Sky ships along with ships provided by other plugin
  data.
