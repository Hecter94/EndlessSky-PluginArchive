			`	"[Greetings, salutations] <first>. Sorry to [disturb, interrupt] your voyage. I have made a [discovery, observation]: I was checking the [sacred, revered] archives after our conversation and there is an entry for a Jump Drive reserved for [special, ceremonial] circumstances. I believe now is such an occurrence. Please return to Vara K'chrai and we'll retrieve it together."`

		conversation
			`You meet Iktat Rek at the spaceport. He's visibly excited and his feathers are freshly preened. He is wearing ceremonial garb, perhaps something that one would wear when visiting the archives.`
			`	"Hello <first>. I think I may have a solution for our Jump Drive problem. You see, the archives contain information for all [possibilities, futures] our people might encounter. I believe that what we are facing now is what the makers of the archive had in mind when they obtained and stored a Jump Drive for future generations to use in [special, ceremonial] circumstances."`
			`	You accept Iktat Rek's invitation to visit the archives. It takes most of the day to sort through the massive documentation and figure out where the Jump Drive is stored, but finally you found it. 5 hours later you return to your ship tired, but satisfied and with a jump drive in tow. You now have something to offer to the Unfettered in exchange for some information.`
