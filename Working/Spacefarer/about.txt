Welcome to Spacefarer
As a captain, you're responsible for the lives of your crew.  Loss of life is inevitable in the merciless reaches of space.  You stick to exploration, ferrying, and fleet combat.  If anyone dies, it will be everyone when the ship explodes.
Rules:
One Jump Drive; No ship capturing; No plundering installed outfits.
