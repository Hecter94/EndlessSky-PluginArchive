# Recommended 

To fully utilize mining/utility fighters and drones provided with this plugin you can try Sam's Mining Complete fork of the game which allows you ~~command your ships to target mineable asteroids~~(In vanilla now) and distribute fuel among your fleet with fighters. The fork also provides other gameplay improvements and bug fixes.
