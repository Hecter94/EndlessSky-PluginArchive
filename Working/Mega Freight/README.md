Adds several ships for you and various factions to use adding more variety to the galaxy as well as universe progression releasing new ships and technologies dependent and independent of storyline (mostly just human space for now).
* Faction with new ships: Merchant, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, Hai, Wanderer

Summary of what this plugin adds:

Over 150 ships:
* 50+ Freighters including specialized cargo ships (Fuel, LNG, Chemical, etc.) + 2 Superheavy
* 4 Transports
* 3 Space Liner
* 10+ Utility (Carriers, miners, etc.)
* 20+ Warships + 2 Superheavy (Purpose-built and modification of existing.)
* 1 Battlestation
* 10+ Fighters, Drones, and other carried ships (Utility and Combat)
* 1 Interceptor
* Majority of the ships with limited turret arc both for aesthetic and gameplay.

And other things:
* A few weapons and outfits.
* Special jobs that gets expanded with appropriate ship (Mining, Gas shipping, Chemical shipping, Heavy lift/Crane, Cars, Salvaging, etc.)
* Additional luxury jobs/rich passengers depending on outfits.
* Huge jobs (Passengers, Deliveries, Escorts).
* Just a lot more jobs which are often location-specific. Planet that mines radioactive things export more of that. Leading electronics manufacturer export more of advanced electronics. etc. (WIP)
* New sub-factions often with unique variants, weapons, or even ships (Espion Mining, Rangphenn, Ugyr, Jack's, Rakin, Black Death, Crossguard, Sulso, Maryhal, NGK, Core Food, Core Nuclear, Solacer, Luna Winery, GX, NBSL, KDB/Reshetka, Bellwing/Stilletto).

* Persistent NPC (Battlestations in 3 systems, 2 of which can respawn after some time.)
* Additional ship spawn for some story missions.
* Orbital shipyard orbiting Mars after main plot.
* A few stations (Nordlin, Ankulah, Yokosuka, GS1 Galaxy, Ourea, Forge, Ankaim, Titanite, Zagreus)
* Gradual progression of the universe both dependent and independent of story missions.
  * Stronger pirate fleet over time and merchants upgrading their weapons to keep up.
  * New ships and technologies (timed and/or locked behind story missions and locked behind jobs)
  * Factions constructing new stations.
  * Limited time events that will be resolved by governments after a while.
  * Unlocking secret/exclusive shipyards by gaining favour with specific sub-factions.
* Additional shipyard and outfitter to various locations.
* Basically overhaul human space at this point.

Version above this is usually compatible as well. Endless Sky backward compatibility is exceptional so far.

# Recommended

To fully utilize mining/utility fighters and drones provided with this plugin you can try Sam's Mining Complete fork of the game which allows you ~~command your ships to target mineable asteroids~~(In vanilla now) and distribute fuel among your fleet with fighters. The fork also provides other gameplay improvements and bug fixes.
