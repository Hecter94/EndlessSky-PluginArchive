	description "Started from some veteran pirates modifying their Falcon to suit their need of long range durable cargo ship which eventually results in the Aplomado. Very little of the Falcon it was based on is left as the ship was upgraded and redesigned over the years, with other pirate captain showing interest and present enough money the Aplomado eventually becomes mass produced."

	description "Originally heavily modified Tarazed Falcon by commissioned by some member of the Crossguard Patrol group to be used as long-range fast cruiser with built-in advanced sensors to fight pirates and catch smugglers. Now it's a complete redesign with some outline resemblance to the Tarazed Falcon. Unlike the expertly modified Marauder ships or Aplomado hastily built by pirates, the Eleonorae was optimized and constructed with some of the best tech in Human space, it was rumoured that some component is actually derived from confidential military-grade technology. This made it potentially the of the most advanced warship civilian could get their hand on."

	description `Republic Navy Spetum Class Fleetcarrier is a massive carrier that doubles as mobile headquarter projecting power not only within the system but also to nearby systems. Spetum Class is the first spaceship to carry a complement of fighters on par with wet navy carriers of 20th century. With over 5 times more capacity than older carrier fleets appearance of a single Spetum Class can turn the tide of a battle.`
	description `Public reaction was mixed, while the ship itself it a feat of engineering and a mark of progress in a way some thought the budget could've been better spent else where. Though the ship will be a major deterrence against pirates some were also concerned about the lives of fighter pilots who where often just cannon fodder. Nevertheless armchair generals were all at least somewhat satisfied with what they would consider an actual carrier.`

	description "Dulle Griet class fast battleship was developed as a solution to very limited production capacity of Canaveral Naval Yard thus another design was drafted up. The fast battleship was designed to be smaller and easier to build allowing more shipyard to build them in times of need. Unlike the Claymore which was designed to take on entire fleet by itself Dulle Griet could serve both as flagship for small patrol and escort for larger carriers like Spetum or Lucerne."
	description `Dulle Griet class primary armament is the advanced Eteron torpedoes to shatter any opposing warship before whittling the last of them down with 4 dual V85 railgun turrets and array of flakcannons.`

	description "Stemming from the same development line the Grose Bochse is designed to fit the ExP302 Railcannon, a slightly smaller version of the Railcannon used by Lucerne class and Claymore class now build into a smaller, cheaper, and easier to build frame. With tremendous firepower and range these ships were intended to form the backline of a battle bombarding enemy ships from far beyond their reach."

	description `Republic Navy Supercarrier-Battleship hybrid heavily armed with multiple railgun turrets capable of tearing down smaller ships in seconds. While officially claimed to be recently developed to face against future alien invasion threat it was rumoured to be in research and development long before the war with Free Worlds for potential aggression from the Quarg or someone as advanced as them.`
	description `The ship itself is by far the largest interstellar vessel ever built by humanity truly going into the territory of mobile space station rather as their scale could be measured in kilometers.`

	description `With the formation of the Free Worlds and them looking for carriers, MarStel Industries took this opportunity to convert the Tlielart into full fledged carrier however the development took too long and they were too late as the Free Worlds ended up picking others as their carrier. Though, thanks to its massive size it's capable of carrying enormous amount of fighter as well as larger carried ships unmatched by any other carrier at the time of its development. Due to this it got some interest as mobile service station for the Free Worlds patrol fleets and got adopted as part of the Free Worlds navy after some modification to improve its capability.`

	description `Initially a plan pitched to the Republic Navy as they seek a new fleet carrier with enough capacity for 80 fighters now brought back into development as they realized the looming threat of aliens from all sides and funding to spare. Though the original plan was already considerably expensive, the additional development and modernization for new goal rise the cost through the roof.`
	description `Unlike its predecessors Zuiho and Zuikaku the Kaga was not designed for mercantile escort (and for advertisement) and deterrence with most threat being large pirate fleet where it still have to be somewhat economically viable to build and operate. Kaga Class is designed for greatest chance of victory in combat against potentially more advanced alien with capacity for 90 fighters spread across 3 flight decks for rapid deployment and recovery along with a large array of cutting-edge armaments to out gun any alien warship it may find.`
	
#ship "F-VC38e Shokaku" #export fleetcarrier
	#description `MJK export fleetcarrier. Though minimal in firepower itself, it is capable of supporting large amount of fighters.`
	#description `Unlike the highly advanced, expensive, and restricted Kaga-class, Shokaku is designed to be vastly simpler to build and maintain allow it to be operated by organizations more concerned with budget but still want a highly capable fleetcarrier.`

Also thanks to it's slim profile the ship is remarkably more difficult to hit than any other fighters further improving its survivability. The ship also employ the latest S-270 Shield Regenerator and thus have pre-tuned shields to work with this specific shield regenerator.`

	description `The Yamato is a heavy battleship designed to utilize few large and heavy turret as primary armament drawing inspiration from an ancient naval battleship of the same name. It also uses large array of VLS missiles as additional firepower. To compensate for lack of turn rate of the large turret it employs a large array of smaller turrets to protect itself against smaller and faster vessels and missiles. Large spinal cannon is also equipped on bow of the ship that can deal a massive amount of damage to any enemy vessel.`
	description `The ship is also notably a lot larger than its namesake to fit all the required technologies employing latest iteration of highly efficient and durable shield emitter as well as large array of defensive anti-missile and anti-fighter turrets.`

	description `Kanran is a very old destroyer designed by MJK heavy industries for their security department to protect their properties as well as raiding enemy convoys during the first turf war and sequentially also participated in the Alpha War. At its time it was considered one of the most advanced ship in the sky second only to those from the Deep and with sheer number it was manufactured many survived the conflict and were continually improved that some still survives to this day. Production of this model fluctuates over time but generally on descending trend before stopping not long after the formation of the Republic. Now most of Kanran on the market are ones decomissioned from NGK fleets.`
