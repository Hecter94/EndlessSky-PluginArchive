	spaceport `In addition to salvage operation it's also the final destination for many decommissioned ships as they were sold for scrapping. Though, for some captain this place also became a marketplace for cheap secondhand ships, as depending on their specific condition some ship can be returned to service with minimal repair. Sometimes the station authority even repair and kept some of the ships they found or bought for dealing with pirates.`

Though access beyond the immediate area around the spaceport is restricted for outsiders except for occasional guided tour of the station during weekends.`

Though soon after the pirate raid from the north begins to occur it was quickly militarized to protect itself and the planet below. It is equipped with vast array of gun turrets, missile batteries, and reinforced bays for deploying fighters and small warships to assist in the defense.`
	description `Recently with the Navy base at Farpoint the station is slowly being converted back to non-combat duties hosting several squadron of rescue and repair ships to assist vessels with trouble in orbit. Minor repair and construction of some smaller vessels are also done here. Occasionally it also serve as supply base for Navy ships.`
	spaceport `The main hangar bay is just large enough for most large warship can barely come in. Along the walls shows are a chaotic mess of metal boxes, pipes, and wires as a clear sign of repairs and upgrades over the course of its lifetime. Services and amenities here are rather basic as one could easily take a shuttle down to Prime if they want something fancy.`

	description `Forge Station is one of the oldest station with history dating back to shortly after inhabitation of this region. It first served as storage and preliminary ore processing station before it was exported to other system. Since then it was continually evolved until today where it became a massive multi-ore refinery station as well as a factory for some basic parts. For such reason most of the station today is no longer the same as what it once was.`
