	description "With the need to manufacture a turret large enough to fully utilize the huge mount of the Free Worlds new Barbette-class artillery cruiser they quickly developed the Jaivana cannon that rely on physical shells for design simplicity over energy weapons which are far more complicated and takes longer to develop. Though ballistic weapons are not the most ideal against the shield-heavy navy ships the sheer size would make up enough that it'll be the more effective than any smaller turret on the same mount, at least for the time."
