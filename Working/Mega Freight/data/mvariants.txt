	description `In an attempt to increase sales MarStel Industries engineers converted the rear section cargo bays into fighter bays to give the ship more self-defense capability while still maintaining sufficient cargo capacity at minimal cost. Partially thanks to some design choice permitting the ship to be more modular. Thanks to its large internal area it could also support larger type of carried ships.`
