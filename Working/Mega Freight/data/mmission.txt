		description `To further advance the Republic Navy and secure humanity's future, the government built a new orbital naval yard to allow production of larger and more advanced ships and remains easily upgradable for any future improvement and expansion. The naval yard is very heavily armed with countless of artillery turrets and advanced anti-missile system spread across the surface. There's also always a fleet carrier in nearby orbit, always within clear visual range.`
		description `The shipyard was recently expanded with 4 additional building docks for additional construction capacity giving the Navy more capacity to build the large superheavy warships in times of need. When not building a superheavy vessel each of these building docks can handle up to a dozen ship construction in parallel.`

# A job to be more interactive and make player more aware of which planet they can earn money at instead of invisible payment that player may or may not notice or annoying pop ups on every other planet they land.
#TODO: More sophisticated system, allowing player to select some option like techniques they'll use and possibly area. With consequence, e.g. if player used the skimming maneuver too often on a planet that planet might restrict player from doing it or demand fees. Also maybe gain experience which can lead to better pay.
