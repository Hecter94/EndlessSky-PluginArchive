	description "A tugboat from early days of space trading made to transport cargo containers between ground and space when repulsor engines are still in its infancy and many ships from previous era still lack one or were not designed to enter atmosphere and land at all. With more freighters equipped with repulsor engines these tugboat roles changed to assisting these large and cumbersome ships to land, not unlike their sea-bound ancestor."

	description "Originally heavily modified Tarazed Falcon by commissioned by some member of the Crossguard Patrol group to be used as long-range fast cruiser with built-in advanced sensors to fight pirates and catch smugglers. Now it's a complete redesign with some outline resemblance to the Tarazed Falcon. Unlike the expertly modified Marauder ships or Aplomado hastily built by pirates, the Eleonorae was optimized and constructed with some of the best tech in Human space, it was rumoured that some component is actually derived from confidential military-grade technology. This made it potentially the of the most advanced warship civilian could get their hand on."

	description "Old fleet tanker ship dating from early days of space exploration where hyperdrives were much more inefficient and inhabited planets were few, it came with bays for smaller fuel distribution ships allowing fuel to be distributed among the fleet faster. It also comes with built-in ramscoop to slowly produce fuel as they travel. Very few are seen nowadays as the galaxy becomes more inhabited."

	description `A purpose-built gas tanker used for shipping large amount of gas in liquefied or compressed form across the galaxy. Relatively rare due to their specialized nature mostly running along few industrial worlds. Lightly armed but also less likely to attract pirate attention due to difficulty of storing and maintaining liquefied or compressed gas making it one of the least economical target for them. While pretty much useless in most situation a gas tanker allows you to take special job at some world which can be lucrative due to limited competition.`

	description "Bluewhale is a massive freighter for hauling large amount of cargo across the galaxy. Due to its' cost these ship are often owned by freight companies rather than individuals. While it's capable of carrying much more cargo than most other freighters, one of the major complaint received from captains is that it can take very long to reach the innermost container."

	description "Conveyor is a massive freighter designed and build by Freight Galactic with special mechanism for quickly unloading cargo independent of port equipment and extra ports for resupplying theoretically allowing them to trade much faster than ships of similar size. In practice this is debatable as few ports can keep up with the sheer amount of cargo due to various other factors."
	description `Conveyor is also capable of carrying a small squadron of fighters to protect itself, due to number of fighters carried almost matching entire capacity of the Navy Carrier there were attempts to have it restricted yet the CEO of the company simply told them to come get an actual carrier. It is rumoured that the company was responsible for the development of the more recent Spetum class carrier.`

	description "The Kotroger is a terrestrial mining vehicle as well as spaceflight capability for rapidly hopping from planets to planets or even within the planet itself as each resource pool is drained as well as moving to assist excavation on other site or large construction project requiring earth to be moved in large amount. While not as economical as old-school ground-based excavators its primary strength lies in the extreme mobility compared to regular excavator where it could easily move itself from site to site and begin operation within the same day while regular ones may take days to weeks to disassemble, pack, and move and repeat in reverse at the new site, though it may be unnecessary on larger resource pool it allows the Kotroger to more economically extract resource from smaller pools of rarer materials that may otherwise be uneconomical for regular excavator to operate. Though it is not recommended by both the manufacturer and safety organizations the ship is built with extra heavy duty long-duration repulsor engines that can fire constantly for longer period which may allow it to temporary mine resources from less stable ground with repulsor engines active and minimize the weight it puts on the ground."

	description `Republic Navy Spetum Class Fleetcarrier is a massive carrier that doubles as mobile headquarter projecting power not only within the system but also to nearby systems. Spetum Class is the first spaceship to carry a complement of fighters on par with wet navy carriers of 20th century. With over 5 times more capacity than older carrier fleets appearance of a single Spetum Class can turn the tide of a battle.`
	description `Public reaction was mixed, while the ship itself it a feat of engineering and a mark of progress in a way some thought the budget could've been better spent else where. Though the ship will be a major deterrence against pirates some were also concerned about the lives of fighter pilots who where often just cannon fodder. Nevertheless armchair generals were all at least somewhat satisfied with what they would consider an actual carrier.`

	description `Republic Navy Supercarrier-Battleship hybrid heavily armed with multiple railgun turrets capable of tearing down smaller ships in seconds. While officially claimed to be recently developed to face against future alien invasion threat it was rumoured to be in research and development long before the war with Free Worlds for potential aggression from the Quarg or someone as advanced as them.`

	description `Massive freighter developed to carry as much cargo as possible, and did so exceeding the capacity of every other ship by far. Though unlike the other ship from MarStel Industries, it is very lightly armed relative to cargo capacity to protect itself or speed to dodge any raider and will require decent escort to safely travel.`
	description `Though it carried more than most, if not all, freighter in human space the sheer amount of cargo that have to be unloaded will require ungodly amount of time, equipment, and manpower, which only get worse when loading cargo. Any less than well developed urban spaceport would struggle to service the ship and often will take a few days to complete the operation, if they ever require this much cargo in the first place. This results in the ship being not quite a popular choice in human space as few planets require this much cargo in a single delivery and fewer are capable of handling it.`

	description `With the formation of the Free Worlds and them looking for carriers, MarStel Industries took this opportunity to convert the Tlielart into full fledged carrier however the development took too long and they were too late as the Free Worlds ended up picking others as their carrier. Though, thanks to its massive size it's capable of carrying enormous amount of fighter as well as larger carried ships unmatched by any other carrier at the time of its development. Due to this it got some interest as mobile service station for the Free Worlds patrol fleets and got adopted as part of the Free Worlds navy after some modification to improve its capability.`

	description "Not long after the development of Geocoris the Hai find their freighters outmatched again with the arrival of a new human fleet with even larger freighters forcing them to develop a newer, and even bigger ship to match. While not being able to match the largest of human freighters yet due to their shipyard being highly optimized for smaller ships and this being the largest design they've made for a long time, the Proetida is able to carry more than most human freighters and significantly more than the Geocoris thanks to redesigned cargo pod and spacious internal area. For that it fits in to the gap between larger human freighters like Bluewhale and Conveyor."
