	description "A tugboat from early days of space trading made to transport cargo containers between ground and space when repulsor engines are still in its infancy and many ships from previous era still lack one or were not designed to enter atmosphere and land at all. With more freighters equipped with repulsor engines these tugboat roles changed to assisting these large and cumbersome ships to land, not unlike their sea-bound ancestor."

	description `A purpose-built gas tanker used for shipping large amount of gas in liquefied or compressed form across the galaxy. Relatively rare due to their specialized nature mostly running along few industrial worlds. Lightly armed but also less likely to attract pirate attention due to difficulty of storing and maintaining liquefied or compressed gas making it one of the least economical target for them. While pretty much useless in most situation, a gas tanker allows you to take special, very well paid jobs on some industrial planets.`
	description `Due to nature of liquefied gas requiring extremely low temperature to maintain, any overheating can damage the tanks over time and eventually can cause it to burst, because of this gas tanker captains must keep an eye on their temperature all the time and make sure the temperature is below limit.`

	description `A purpose-built chemical tanker for shipping various industrial chemical including highly corrosive acids with efficiency unmatched by regular freighter. With their specialized nature these ships are also rarer, often found in route to industrial planets or close by only. With difficulty of maintaining transported chemical combined with requiring special port to unload the stored liquid (efficiently) these vessels are less preferred target for pirates. While not useful in general shipping between most worlds these ships profit of their extreme specialization to take on fewer but much more profitable jobs only offered on industrialized worlds.`

	description `A specialized roll-on roll-off ship for efficiently transporting land vehicles in large number by having interior laid out akin to parking lot allowing vehicles to be driven on and off the ship by itself fast and easily without having to wait for cranes. Because the interior is essentially a large empty space other cargo can also be stored allowing it to be more flexible than other specialized ships like tankers.`
	description `Because of the highly valuable cargo and relative lack of defences these ships relies heavily on escorts to protect it.`

Though only a relatively small quantity of bitumen is required for most construction, several on going projects especially on developing worlds can require significant amount of bitumen. Because the service area for these ships often lack specialized discharge facilities the Lithalsa comes with it's own discharging system for unloading its cargo directly onto trucks or other transport to distribute it to the site.`

	description "Conveyor is a massive freighter designed and build by Freight Galactic with special mechanism for quickly unloading cargo independent of port equipment and extra ports for resupplying theoretically allowing them to trade much faster than ships of similar size. In practice this is debatable as few ports can keep up with the sheer amount of cargo due to various other factors."
	description `Conveyor is also capable of carrying a small squadron of fighters to protect itself, due to number of fighters carried almost matching entire capacity of the Navy Carrier there were attempts to have it restricted yet the CEO of the company simply told them to come get an actual carrier. It is rumoured that the company was responsible for the development of the more recent Spetum class carrier.`

	description `Inspired by the Syndicate H-class super container ship a smaller freighter development was halted in favor of an even larger freighter, and perhaps the largest freighter to ever be developed in human space. The hull of the smaller predecessor in development was modified and used as the Exchanger primary cargo arms that can be deployed to land and unload cargo as the Exchanger itself is too large to land on any port.`
	description `To protect itself the ship carries vast array of armaments rivalling most warships as well as entire wings of fighters to protect itself. Though the sub cargo ships attached to the arms can be deployed they were stripped down by a lot and do not serves as effective combat ship on its own as well as often taking longer to deploy as they were not designed to be deployed for immediate actions.`

	description "The Kotroger is a terrestrial mining vehicle as well as spaceflight capability for rapidly hopping from planets to planets or even within the planet itself as each resource pool is drained as well as moving to assist excavation on other site or large construction project requiring earth to be moved in large amount. While not as economical as old-school ground-based excavators its primary strength lies in the extreme mobility compared to regular excavator where it could easily move itself from site to site and begin operation within the same day while regular ones may take days to weeks to disassemble, pack, and move and repeat in reverse at the new site, though it may be unnecessary on larger resource pool it allows the Kotroger to more economically extract resource from smaller pools of rarer materials that may otherwise be uneconomical for regular excavator to operate. Though it is not recommended by both the manufacturer and safety organizations the ship is built with extra heavy duty long-duration repulsor engines that can fire constantly for longer period which may allow it to temporary mine resources from less stable ground with repulsor engines active and minimize the weight it puts on the ground."

	description `Espion-exclusive mining carrier, or rather a mobile mining and refinery station to extract and process resources on the go as due to its large cargo holds it may spend much of its time in flight to collect a full cargo of resources. Due to its size and slowness the vessel is less than ideal for mining and collecting resources itself but instead relys and a sizeable fleet of fighters and drones to mine and collect resource for it. To protect their miners from harm as they operate far away from the mothership the Wombat also comes with space for 4 pocket light warships to guard the miners.`

	description `Massive freighter developed to carry as much cargo as possible, and did so exceeding the capacity of every other ship by far. Though unlike the other ship from MarStel Industries, it is very lightly armed relative to cargo capacity to protect itself or speed to dodge any raider and will require decent escort to safely travel.`
	description `Though it carried more than most, if not all, freighter in human space the sheer amount of cargo that have to be unloaded will require ungodly amount of time, equipment, and manpower, which only get worse when loading cargo. Any less than well developed urban spaceport would struggle to service the ship and often will take a few days to complete the operation, if they ever require this much cargo in the first place. This results in the ship being not quite a popular choice in human space as few planets require this much cargo in a single delivery and fewer are capable of handling it.`

	description `A water tanker ship for transporting fresh water to nearby colonies or stations which are incapable of generating enough fresh water themselves. The Minnow itself is slow and lightly armed making it incapable of defending itself or escaping which makes it less ideal for travelling to frontier worlds alone with the raise of piracy.`
	description `Now that most colony are developed enough to supply their own water these ships became much rarer as their need decreases. Now only a small number remains parked in systems that have stations for occasional resupply mission.`

	description `A specialized bulk carrier for bagging sugar designed in cooperation between Vefrol Dockyards and Pioneer Heavy Industries for the Core Food Corperation to decrease port time during unloading allowing overall faster turnaround. Though the ship lacks of large cargo loading hatches to maintain a closed system free of contaminants and instead loaded via special sealed conveyor belts. It also got built-in fast and highly efficient bagging facility for rapidly bagging its cargo which can be unloaded at the port far faster than in bulk as well as being less reliant on specialized sugar unloading equipment and storage most port does not have.`

Even after a processing plant was build on a planet these vessels are still used to collect garbage from various settlements scattered around the planet. The ship is equipped with six compactor to quickly load the garbage though practically the crew said three is more than enough for most small settlements this ship would be visiting and all compactors will only be utilized in more urban area.`

	description "A general heavy freight pusher introduced before the forming of the Republic. Designed to clamp or deploy cargo containers in orbit where transporting it to the ground is handled by a tug, though with recent advancements basically all modern containers are equipped with their own landing gear allow the ship to detach the container at the port by self. Though not super popular like the Haulers it's still preferred by several captains for its versatility of being to able to quickly latch onto multiple type of cargo pods allow them to quickly adapt to whatever market demands."

	description `Curie-class is a purpose-built nuclear fuel carrier dedicated to transporting all sort of radioactive cargo like fresh nuclear fuel, spent nuclear fuel, and radioactive waste. With multiple redundancies for all critical systems from engines, cooling system, electrical systems to navigation systems as well as reinforced bulkheads to resist even the most extreme accident while keeping their cargo is intact. Though the bridge is visible it is reinforced with additional armour it is mainly only used for landing and on-ground operations like unloading the cargo, the ship's primary control room buried deep inside the ship also with another layer of armour around it, not unlike what one would've expected from a warship. With the requirement to keep the cargo cool all the time the ship is also built-in with dedicated cooling system for the cargo hold which is isolated from cooling system for the rest of the ship as well as having its own backup generator. Though all radioactive cargo comes with their own radiation shielding container, the material for this ship's cargo hold is also selected to provide decent amount of shielding as well.`
	description `Another part of the ship's safety includes crews trained to handle radioactive cargo as well as responding to various forseeable incidents from collision, fire, to pirates boarding, in the most unlikely case that it occurs. In addition to that the ship is also equipped for in-flight repairs allowing the ship to perform rudimentary repair on itself if damaged though there's a small delay before the repair can begin and longer delay if the ship got disabled. Because all of these the ship's minimum crew is almost the same as chemical tankers of larger size and operating cost is one of the highest.`

	description `DSSE Shipbuilding specialized fishing and fish processing vessel built to operate both in sea and space. It utilized a uniquely engineered multi-mode engine that can run both in sea, air, and vacuum to save on space while being able to operate efficiently on all front.`
	description `Unlike regular trawlers this vessel can use its repulsor engines to lift itself just above the water significantly increasing speed for the vessel allowing it to catch fish faster as well as being able to catch some faster exotic fishes called by some sailors "skimming". Due to these maneuvers the net was also designed to resist such speed and force as well as allowing it to hold much more fish than standard trawler nets. After which the captured fish can be quickly pulled inside the ship to be processed into fillet, block, canned or other forms as required before being sent to the frozen cargo holds to keep it from spoiling. Its ability to travel at higher speed in air also means the ship could travel between fishing spots far faster than standard water-bound fishing vessels though this is less often done as the extra strain means more maintenance later on which can be uneconomical if done too often. Another unique option for these vessels is allowing it to be very opportunistic in stormy worlds where they can quickly snatch up rare marine animals unique to that world during a small window of calm sea and bail out at the last minute before the heavy storm and high wave hit them.`
	description `Its space capability is also often utilized by owner of these vessel to rapidly move them around between worlds as market demand shift and new specie of edible fishes were discovered or between known types due to random influences. In addition to solo operations these ships also have option of serving as mothership carry two additional ships to assist the operation on longer expeditions for more continuous supply of fish while processed products are offloaded to another reefer ship where the product is delivered to the port.`
	description `Because of its adaptability and high efficiency these vessels are almost universally hated by local fishermens especially among worlds whose main export is marine products, to the point some worlds are considering to ban or greatly restrict usage of these ships.`

	description `To compete with the newer, more modern heavy freighters dominating the market the Syndicate stacked their Container Transport into a huge Heavy Container Transport tripling capacity but also slowing it down even further from its already despised slug-pace. Though with barely any additional crew requirement from its predecessor the G-Class Container Transport cargo-to-crew ratio is absolutely unmatched.`
	description `Though still not the most capacious in the area it instead can also carry drones to either defend itself or assist during unloading operation in less-equipped ports.`

	description `This is the Syndicate take on superheavy freighter capable of carrying over a hundred times more than a regular Container Transport and three times more than its competitor. Due to its design the ship cannot land without a dedicated gear to accept them and is intended to stay in orbit instead while it carry a fleet of transfer ship to unload the cargoes for it in bulk. Due to the size of its bay it can even carry heavy warships along side to protect itself.`

	description "Not long after the development of Geocoris the Hai find their freighters outmatched again with the arrival of a new human fleet with even larger freighters forcing them to develop a newer, and even bigger ship to match. While not being able to match the largest of human freighters yet due to their shipyard being highly optimized for smaller ships and this being the largest design they've made for a long time, the Proetida is able to carry more than most human freighters and significantly more than the Geocoris thanks to redesigned cargo pod and spacious internal area. For that it fits in to the gap between larger human freighters like Bluewhale and Conveyor."
