#todo: other sections
#iirc last time calced it need at least 900 sections, at rate of 1 section per year it'd take almost a millennium to complete. Prob need to be build at 20+ a year to be slightly more practical. (which is quite a lot of concurrent construction but probably doable at Mega Freight scale.)

With consequence, e.g. if player used the skimming maneuver too often on a planet that planet might restrict player from doing it or demand fees. Also maybe gain experience which can lead to better pay.
