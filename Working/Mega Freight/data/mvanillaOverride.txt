			`You've located the Scar's Hideout, a massive asteroid in orbit around a gas giant. As you fly over the asteroid's surface, you spot an open blast door. They must be inviting you inside. It surprises you that a gang of pirates would be capable of creating such a base, as the materials and time needed to make something like this are immense.`
