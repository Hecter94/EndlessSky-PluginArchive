	description "Started from some veteran pirates modifying their Falcon to suit their need of long range durable cargo ship which eventually results in the Aplomado. Very little of the Falcon it was based on is left as the ship was upgraded and redesigned over the years, with other pirate captain showing interest and present enough money the Aplomado eventually becomes mass produced."

	description "Originally heavily modified Tarazed Falcon by commissioned by some member of the Crossguard Patrol group to be used as long-range fast cruiser with built-in advanced sensors to fight pirates and catch smugglers. Now it's a complete redesign with some outline resemblance to the Tarazed Falcon. Unlike the expertly modified Marauder ships or Aplomado hastily built by pirates, the Eleonorae was optimized and constructed with some of the best tech in Human space, it was rumoured that some component is actually derived from confidential military-grade technology. This made it potentially the of the most advanced warship civilian could get their hand on."

	description `Republic Navy Spetum Class Fleetcarrier is a massive carrier that doubles as mobile headquarter projecting power not only within the system but also to nearby systems. Spetum Class is the first spaceship to carry a complement of fighters on par with wet navy carriers of 20th century. With over 5 times more capacity than older carrier fleets appearance of a single Spetum Class can turn the tide of a battle.`
	description `Public reaction was mixed, while the ship itself it a feat of engineering and a mark of progress in a way some thought the budget could've been better spent else where. Though the ship will be a major deterrence against pirates some were also concerned about the lives of fighter pilots who where often just cannon fodder. Nevertheless armchair generals were all at least somewhat satisfied with what they would consider an actual carrier.`

	description "Dulle Griet class fast battleship was developed as a solution to very limited production capacity of Canaveral Naval Yard thus another design was drafted up. The fast battleship was designed to be smaller and easier to build allowing more shipyard to build them in times of need. Unlike the Claymore which was designed to take on entire fleet by itself Dulle Griet could serve both as flagship for small patrol and escort for larger carriers like Spetum or Lucerne."
	description `Dulle Griet class primary armament is the advanced Eteron torpedoes to shatter any opposing warship before whittling the last of them down with 4 dual V85 railgun turrets and array of flakcannons.`

	description "Stemming from the same development line the Grose Bochse is designed to fit the ExP302 Railcannon, a slightly smaller version of the Railcannon used by Lucerne class and Claymore class now build into a smaller, cheaper, and easier to build frame. With tremendous firepower and range these ships were intended to form the backline of a battle bombarding enemy ships from far beyond their reach."

	description `Republic Navy Supercarrier-Battleship hybrid heavily armed with multiple railgun turrets capable of tearing down smaller ships in seconds. While officially claimed to be recently developed to face against future alien invasion threat it was rumoured to be in research and development long before the war with Free Worlds for potential aggression from the Quarg or someone as advanced as them.`
	description `The ship itself is by far the largest interstellar vessel ever built by humanity truly going into the territory of mobile space station rather as their scale could be measured in kilometers.`
