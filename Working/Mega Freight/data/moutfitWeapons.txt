	description `A compact energy-based artillery cannon developed from a proprietary technology that is smaller and more powerful than railgun system used by Republic Navy but consumes vastly more amount of energy as well as far longer cooldown period. It also requires a special set of reactors for it to fire further limiting its use on other ships. Though despite the drawback a single shot from this weapon can decimate an entire fleet.`

Though ballistic weapons are not the most ideal against the shield-heavy navy ships the sheer size would make up enough that it'll be the more effective than any smaller turret on the same mount, at least for the time."

	description "Due to critical lack of range making beam weapons simply impractical on larger warships Deep Sky labs developed a new system to improve the range of their existing technology by focusing the power into shorter burst. Though far less efficient and still cannot match the range of other weapon systems like particle or proton it is still enough while also coming in a smaller package mounting only single gun on the turret."
