name "Mega Freight"
version 1.0.0010101000100100110
about `Add 162(so far) ships ranging from small freighter to massive container carriers and warships for nearly every faction and more. More stations to exploit the benefit of vacuum and zero-g environment and serve the other purpose than refineries. Ship releases and new station constructions as well as a few background changes to keep universe (somewhat) more alive.

Many of new the freighter are also specialized and may unlock more well-paid jobs as well as larger jobs to fill up larger ships.`
