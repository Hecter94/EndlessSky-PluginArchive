Remnant To-Do list:
- Change Remnant Sign to be a longer thing using an event or two instead of sequential missions to represent learning the language over time.
- Add Remnant variants using Korath tech.
- Change the three retrieval missions to be unique, including branching dialogue to account for whether or not they have met Tali before.

Done in Dec16corrections:- Expanded Horizons - Quarg scanning the Quarg, there's an ambiguous "they" in the complete dialog that could be referring to either the researchers or the Quarg ships.
Done in Dec16corrections:- Expanded Horiozns - Quarg Return: human space, human scanners. Change the reference to "human space" and remove the "human" from scanners.

Done in Dec16corrections:- Rebalance Software Scanner: At 3 tons, it is the same size as the cargo scanner and outfit scanner combined, and provides better cargo scanning but worse outfit scanning (and a little tactical)
Done in Dec16corrections:- Thought: remove cargo scanning entirely, reduce size to 1 ton.
Done in Dec16corrections: Actual change: reduced size to 2 tons, removed cargo scanning entirely, increased tactical power to 26)

Done in Dec16corrections- Returning the eggs fix "readying the eggs in the cargo hold", then subsequently equalizing pressure in the cargo hold. Too many cargo holds?

- Logbook entries: Entry regarding Remnant heavy capital ships?
- Logbook entries: NPCs?

- Modify Hai mission to reflect of one has done the Remnant Salvage 1 and already been to the library (Hai Cultural Archives mission thingy)

			`Looking around at the Remnant spaceport, it suddenly strikes you how amazing this is. You never would have imagined that you would end up here back when you earned your pilot's license. It seems so long ago that your biggest concern was deciding whether to pay off your loan by ferrying cargo, doing courier jobs, or escorting merchants. (and on your darker days - by being a pirate).`
			`	Thinking back, it suddenly occurs to you that you helped retrieve a science drone for some researchers on Bounty - researchers who were studying the wormhole in Terminus. Research like that might be of interest to the Remnant, seeing as it could open the door to research vessels venturing into the Ember Wastes. It would only be a matter of time until someone figures out how to use the key stones - either by luck or by research, and then the Remnant's secrecy would vanish.`

			`	For lack of a better place to go, you stop by the information desk where you picked up the sign language course. You tell the attendant that you have something potentially important - but non-urgent - to discuss in regards to Remnant security. They tap a few buttons, then give you directions down a hallway. You quickly find yourself in an armory where several remnant guards are in the process of cleaning their weapons. One stands up and comes over to you.`
			`	"Greetings Captain, I am Prefect Reegar. I was told you had some information that could be important?"`
			`	He takes a seat on a bench on the far side of the room from the other Remnant, and gestures for you to take a seat with him.`
			`	You give him some background about the current state of Human and Hai understanding about the wormholes - or the lack thereof - then explain how you met a team of researchers who were using drones to study the wormhole exit in the Terminus system. He quickly picks up on the potential threat if someone figures out the key to using them, especially since you have demonstrated that it only takes one curious human to figure it out.`
			`	Thinking carefully, he asks, "It is clear that we need to keep an eye on this situation. You know more about the rest of the galaxy than we do, so could you find them and see how much progress they have made?"`

			`A few hours of searching later, you find a lead: It seems that launching probes into the Terminus system isn't exactly a common activity, so their permits stand out from the rest. A helpful clerk in the spaceport office pulled up their application and found that they are listed as part of a university in the Deep, although it doesn't mention which planet their specific campus is on. A quick check of the directory lists a number of planets where they could be found.`

			`	Once you've landed on <planet> you look up the local university and pay it a visit. After thinking about it for a minute, you decide that probably the best source of information would be to visit the university library and ask one of the librarians for assistance locating research on wormholes. After some brief research, they return with a handful of research papers published over the past decade. They proudly note that two of the more recent papers were published here in the Deep, and transfer copies of each to you for free.`

			`Back on board <ship>, you take a moment to flip through the papers.  You quickly realize that little beyond the summary is understandable to someone without a good theoretical understanding of physics. Even with your first-hand experience of wormholes, most of what they are discussing doesn't make much sense.`
			`	All the academic stuff aside, the summary on the most recent paper confirms that the researchers are making progress: They have determined that the spatial anomaly in the Terminus system is in fact a wormhole with some kind of instability. They also speculate that it may be possible for a ship to artificially stabilize the wormhole enough for it to pass through unharmed.`
			`	Prefect Reegar is definitely going to be interested in seeing this.`

			`The trip back to the Ember Wastes is long, and it gave you plenty of opportunities to think about what this research could lead to. You also wondered about what the Remnant will do, as it seems obvious that their current isolation is about to fail.`
			`	Reegar seems grimly optimistic on receiving your report "If this had happened without us being aware, it could have gone badly. Fortunately for us, you were in the right place at the right time, and have proven yourself loyal to us. So we are now forewarned and can use this time to plan and prepare for it. Perhaps re-establishing contact with the rest of humanity could even be to our benefit, but that will be for the council to decide."`
			`	"Thank you, Captain. If you ever come across any other interesting information like this, don't hesitate to bring it to me."`
