Zitchas Remnant eXpansion II
My collection of missions, excitement, and additional stuff for the Remnant.


v 0.1 - Initial setup (The previous Remnant plug-in has been removed due to being completely subsumed into the Remnant Content PR)


Planned:
- Addition of the Peregrine (Medium Warship, cloaking, high speed, flanker)(mid plot)
- Addition of the Vulture (Heavy Warship, cloaking, high speed, cruiser)(late plot)
- Addition of the Penguin (light transport, cloaking, high speed, gascraft upgrade)(early plot)
- Addition of the Condor (Author Ship, Heavy Warship, cloaking, high speed, gascraft, late plot)
- Hyperlane Alteration Scanning mission set
- Void Sprite observation set (observation satellite, Void Elders, Korath Hunting Party, Archon contact)
