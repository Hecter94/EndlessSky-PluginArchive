# ZRemnantX
Zitchas' Test-Bed plugin for Endless Sky. This plug-in is not intended for general distribution, but rather serves as a temporary holding area for various ideas and thing that I am testing or have recently been tested. It isn't balanced, and sometimes breaks things. It also serves as a holding spot for a lot of lore that I work with, such as the timeline for Remnant stuff.

# The Remnant
The Remnant were originally a group of humans who fled human space in the early years of the Alpha War, circa 2455. They fled in secret, and intentionally made sure that there was no record of them or their departure. Their fear was that the Alpha's would win, and humanity would be destroyed, and thus they sought to establish new worlds where humanity might survive in hiding. To this end they cut off all contact with human systems, and avoid traveling in systems close to the edge of known human space in order to prevent anyone from being able to follow them home.

The Sheragi discovered spaceflight around 100,000 years ago, about the time of the peak of the Hai empire, around the same time that the ancestors of modern humans began "banging rocks together." The Sheragi civilization survived less than a millennium after that.

The Hai discovered spaceflight about 120,000 years ago, and their civil wars stretched from about 95,000 to 90,000 years ago. 90,000 years ago, the Hai pulled back from "human" space and from the ruined worlds to the north of them, and 80,000 years ago the Wanderers moved into that northern territory.

The Korath, Saryds, Kimek, Arachi, and finally the humans, discovered spaceflight 40, 17, 14, 10, and 1 thousand years ago, respectively. Note that that means that new spacefaring species have been appearing more and more frequently in recent history, which is part of why the Archons have been having so much trouble holding things together lately.
