			`As you disembark your ship on the bustling Hai planet, a peculiar sight greets you, a cheerful Hai parcel carrier scurrying towards you, balancing four packages on her arms. She stops in front of you, panting slightly, and with a flick of her arms, the packages land with a soft *thud* at your feet.`
			`"Delivery for you, esteemed traveler!" the carrier chirps.`
			`You scratch your head in confusion. "Uh, I didn't order anything..."`
			`The carrier waves off your protest with a friendly whistle. "No worries, it's all correct! Just sign here, and it's all yours!"`
			`With a shrug and a squiggle of your signature, you accept the parcels. Curiosity piqued, you tear into the packaging as soon as you're back on your ship. Inside, you find... Hai snacks?`
			`As the realization dawns that you are not the intended recipient, you make your way to the spaceport office. The organizer there chuckles as you explain the mix-up.`
			`"Oh, them's just old Spindle's packages. He's been gone for hours. If you don't want 'em, we'll just toss 'em. But hey, those survival rations are top-notch!"`
			`You now face a decision: Keep the oddball haul or leave it to gather dust at the spaceport. The choice is yours!`
