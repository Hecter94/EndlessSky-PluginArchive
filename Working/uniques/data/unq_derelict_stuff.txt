	description `A special scanner to detect old ship wrecks. Active ships send out many kinds of radiation, and even disabled ships can be detected for months, till their engines and reactors are cold and dead. You don't understand how it works, but this scanner can detect ship wrecks which are dead for centuries.`

	description "The Argosy from Southbound Shipyards is very popular with merchants not because of its capacity, which is actually slightly smaller than the Syndicate Freighter, but because it can hold its own in combat even against a small pirate fleet."
	description "	The Argosy is also a very easy ship to upgrade with faster engines or more powerful weapons as needed, so many privately owned Argosies have very different capabilities than the stock model."

	description "The Carrier is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Carrier can also do significant damage in close combat."
