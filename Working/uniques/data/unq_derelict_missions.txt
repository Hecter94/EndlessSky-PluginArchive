			`After entering the outfitter, you go to the terminals where you go through the inventory lists. In a workshop to the side you see a young woman jumping up from her work cheering.`
			`"What's the reason for the good mood?" you ask.`
			`"I've just finished working on a new type of scanner. It's a highly experimental scanner for detecting shipwrecks that have been floating around for years or decades, cold and so far undetectable. I'm hoping to use it to finance my own small workshop. At the moment I've just rented this little workspace."`
			`You think about the possibilities of this type of scanner. There are certainly countless treasures floating around out there in the vastness of space, unnoticed by the thousands of ships that continually cross these systems. Do you want to try to buy the scanner from her?`
