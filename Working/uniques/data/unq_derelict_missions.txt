How many lives they've lived, enduring endless wars, losing their home, and now adjusting to peace. What discoveries might they be making on the once-hostile worlds the Automata used to occupy?`
			`As you drift deeper into thought, a familiar voice calls out across the crowd:`
			`"<first>! <first>! It's great to see you again! I've learned so much and heard so many stories!"`
			`You turn to see Rek, beaming with excitement. You greet him warmly, share a laugh, and the two of you head to a nearby diner. Over a meal, Rek eagerly recounts his latest adventures. He tells you that he's now fluent in Korathi, and that many Efreti have begun to admire his curiosity and courage.`
			`"What stories have you heard?" you ask, lifting a spoonful of Korathi stew. Rek smirks knowingly. "I knew you'd ask that. But none of the Efreti scouts have managed to find the 'trophy' of this one." The word 'trophy' immediately piques your interest. Rek continues, "There's a massive derelict ship somewhere in Kor Ak'Mari far larger than an Echo-Galleon. Big enough to hold thousands of people. It hasn't flown since the Korath exile. They called it the Korsmanath A'awoj. The problem is, no one's been able to locate it. The scouts tried to trace it, but the signal always fades away." He chuckles. "Strange, isn't it? How something that huge could just disappear."`
			`You recall seeing similar ships in the exile systems, vessels that could fight off entire pirate fleets, maybe even challenge the Quarg through sheer force. But for one to vanish entirely? That's a mystery too good to resist.`
			`After finishing your meal and catching up with Rek, you make your decision.`
			`"Rek," you say, "how would you feel about joining me in the search for the Korsmanath?"`
			`His eyes light up. "I didn't think you'd ask! Of course I'll join you. It's about time we went on another adventure together."`
			`With that, the two of you return to your ship and begin preparing for the journey ahead.`

The Korsmanath is vast beyond comprehension, capable of creating new societies on uninhabited worlds, yet equally capable of destroying them. Its power is both inspiring and terrifying. For a moment, you can almost imagine what it felt like to live aboard this mothership, to command such strength, to feel untouchable.`
				`Eventually, you reach what was once the engineering section. The systems are dead, and there's no jump drive in sight. Without one, there's no way to move this behemoth. Installing a new one will take more than just the two of you.`
				`"Even if we got it running again," you say, "we'd never get it out of the system by ourselves. What do you think?"`
				`Rek rubs his chin, then grins. "We'll need help. Let's head back to Setar Fort. I can rally some Efreti engineers while you secure a spare Jump Drive, if you don't already have one tucked away."`
				`You nod in agreement. Together, you return to your ship, eager to bring this ancient titan back to life.`

			`Back at Setar Fort, Rek reminds you not to linger. "You'll need to find that Jump Drive," he says. "I'll gather the Efreti engineers and prepare everything we'll need. Meet us here once you've got it." With that, Rek hurries off, already deep in thought about the restoration to come.`

			`With the Jump Drive safely secured in your cargo hold, you make your way through the busy port in search of Rek. It doesn't take long to spot him, already surrounded by a small group of eager Efreti engineers. When he sees you, he waves excitedly.`
			`"Perfect timing!" Rek says. "We're all ready. Let's not waste a moment, shall we?"`
			`You nod, and together with Rek and his helpers, you load the equipment aboard your ship. Soon, you're en route to Kor Ak'Mari once more, ready to re-board the Korsmanath.`

				`The boarding goes smoothly this time. Rek translates the Korathi inscriptions while the Efreti team installs the Jump Drive with practiced precision. A few of them begin wandering off to explore the ship, but you nudge Rek, and he reminds them to save their curiosity for later. There will be plenty of time to explore once the ship is safely back at Setar Fort.`
				`"Hard to believe this will soon be part of my fleet," you say, gazing at the control panels.`
				`Rek gives a wry smile. "Yes, quite something, isn't it? Just promise me you won't use it for war, or to repeat the Korath's mistakes."`
				`Moments later, the Efreti signal that the installation is complete and the ship is ready for transit.`
				`"We should escort it home," Rek suggests. "Make sure it arrives safely."`
				`You agree, and after explaining the plan to the crew, you return to your ship, ready to escort the newly awakened Korsmanath back to Setar Fort.`

			`Once you land, the Efreti waste no time. Dozens of them rush aboard the Korsmanath, armed with scanners, tools, and notebooks. Some snap photos, others take frantic notes. You can't help but smile, this is history being rediscovered.`
			`"The ship's in remarkable condition," Rek says, watching proudly. "With luck, repairs should only take a few hours." His tone carries both pride and sadness.`
			`"You okay, Rek?" you ask.`
			`He nods slowly. "Yes, of course. It's just... a shame you can't stay longer."`
			`You assure him that he can always reach out when needed, and you'll return. You talk for a while longer until one of the Efreti calls out that the restoration is complete.`
			`"See you among the stars, my friend," Rek says as you prepare to depart. He waves, smiling.`
			`Now, the Korsmanath is yours, fully functional and under your command. What you do with it next is entirely up to you.`
