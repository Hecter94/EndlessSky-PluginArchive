	description `A modern art figurine of a cat, made of glass. It is a gift by 'Beings for Ethical Treatment of Animals' (BETA) for your work in the field of animal protection. You just wonder how this Organization found out of your pet rescues. Do they have some kind of intelligence service?`

	description `Once just an innocent bystander caught in a firefight, "Cleo" has come a long way, now she reigns supreme on the starship bridge. Technically, she holds no official rank, but everyone knows she's one level above the captain.`
	description `She strolls across control panels like she owns them (because she does), and dares anyone to move her. Orders? She ignores them. Meetings? She naps through them. The crew adores her, or fears her, it's hard to tell. "Cleo" is equal parts survivor, diva, and dictator. A true legend in fur. After all, not every ship has a queen lounging on the command console.`

	description `"Babou", former pirate ocelot, current hero, and still a menace to unattended snacks. Sleek, spotted, and dangerously charming, "Babou" struts with the confidence of someone who's stolen both,  hearts and cargo.`
	description `About the size of a large housecat, but with the attitude of a jungle god, ocelots like "Babou" are known for their agility, sharp claws, and zero respect for personal space. Once feared across the galaxy as the "Whiskered Bandit", "Babou" now fights for the good side... mostly. Just don't try to put a collar on him. Or touch his tail. Seriously. You've been warned.`

	description `This little raccoon is always at your side. At least at lunchtime. With his bandit mask and grabby little hands, he's the galaxy's most adorable food thief. Officially, he's not part of the crew, but try telling him that when he's already halfway into your sandwich.`
	description `Raccoons are clever, curious, and alarmingly good at opening things they absolutely shouldn't. Like airlock panels. Or pudding cups. Somehow both. He's loyal in his own mischievous way, especially if snacks are involved. Just don't leave shiny objects lying around. Or snacks. Or anything. He's not a pet, he's a fuzzy, chaos-powered sidekick.`

	description `Some kind of strange animal, more exactly a xenomorph, you found on a derelict ship. Although it tries to bite you regularly, you keep it as a pet. Why? Well... it's kind of cute in a terrifying, acid-dripping, nightmarish way.`
	description `You've named it "Snuggles", which seems to confuse and mildly enrage it. It hisses at everyone, chews on bulkheads, and once tried to cocoon you. Classic "Snuggles". Still, it follows you around, sleeps (hanging upside down) near your bunk, and only occasionally drools on the navigation console. Deep down, you think it likes you. Or maybe it's just waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Either way, companionship!`

	description `"Gummi Bear" is a hyperactive ferret with zero sense of fear and even less understanding of privacy. He's always wherever the action is, blaster fire, engine malfunctions, spontaneous zero-G dance parties. You name it, he's in the middle of it.`
	description `Somehow, he especially enjoys space battles, zooming through the corridors like a furry torpedo of chaos. No one knows how he gets into the ventilation shafts so fast. Or how he got into your helmet. Again. He may be small, but he's 100% trouble, and 110% adorable. He's not just a pet. He's the ship's unofficial morale officer. And chaos gremlin.`

	description `You installed half a tree on the bridge for "Archie". Now he sleeps there. All day. Every day. Occasionally, he takes a break, to eat, stretch, and give the crew a slow, judgmental blink. That's it.`
	description `He's fluffy, he's lazy, and somehow he's become the ship's emotional support koala. He contributes absolutely nothing to missions, but morale skyrocketed the day he arrived. No one dares question his presence anymore. He once clung to the navigator's leg for two hours. The navigator never spoke of it again. Archie may not move much, but when he does, it's usually toward snacks. Or higher branches.`

	description `"Thumper" may look like a fluffy bundle of innocence, but don't be fooled, he's a cable-chewing menace with a twitchy nose and a thirst for destruction. It took a full engineering team and three rolls of anti-gnawing tape to rabbit-proof the bridge. If only he weren't so heartbreakingly adorable.`
	description `The crew pretends to love him, but you've seen the fear in their eyes. One even called him the "Rabbit of Caerbannog". You don't get the reference, but judging by the way he shredded a datapad last week... maybe you should find out. Still, he's your rabbit. Your adorable, slightly terrifying little chaos bunny.`

	description `As a real spacefaring hamster, "Peanut" takes his nut-smuggling duties very seriously. Tiny but determined, he can transport an impossible amount of cargo, mostly nuts, snacks, and occasionally shiny bolts, straight to his nest behind the communications console. No one knows how he got access to the ship's storage bay, but somehow he's hoarding half the crew's trail mix.`
	description `He's small, fast, and utterly fearless. He once squared off with a cleaning droid. He won. "Peanut" is fluffy, full of attitude, and always busy with some mysterious hamster mission. Is he just cute? Or secretly running the whole ship? No one's sure.`

	description `"Trixie" is a little squirrel girl with big eyes, a bushy tail, and the energy of a caffeine-powered rocket. She's now your friend. Well, more like your tiny, nut-hoarding shadow.`
	description `Whenever Hai visit the ship, "Trixie" instantly becomes the main attraction. She performs daring acrobatics across the ceiling panels, poses dramatically on consoles, and occasionally steals someone's snack mid-sentence. The Hai are completely mesmerized.`
	description `She may look cute, but she's a certified whirlwind of fluff and mischief. Whether she's chasing laser pointers or hiding in the captain's chair, one thing's certain: life aboard the ship got a lot more fun.`

	thumbnail "outfit/fluffy_exotic"
	description `An alien of unknown origin, discovered aboard a derelict ship, now a semi-official crew member, mostly because no one can catch it. It looks like a gas-filled beach ball with webbed feet and a permanent look of mild confusion. It bounces instead of walks, squeaks instead of speaks, and somehow got into the air ducts twice.`
	description `Generally friendly, until it's hungry. Then it turns into a grumpy, floating menace with a taste for freeze-dried rations and fingers. Still, you've grown oddly attached to it. You even named it "Exotic". No idea what it is, but it's yours. Probably. Unless it eats you.`

	description `Attila the chicken is no ordinary bird. Once traded in a shady deal between a slick businessman and a ruthless space pirate, both of whom are now conveniently dead. He struts around like he owns the galaxy, feathers bristling with dark history. Every peck carries the weight of interstellar betrayal, and every cluck echoes with cosmic menace.`

	thumbnail "outfit/fluffy_audreyii"
	description `"Audrey II" is a bizarre, plantlike alien you stumbled upon in the husk of a derelict ship. At first, it looks terrifying, an enormous flytrap with a mouth full of what can only be described as salad-themed teeth, but once you get to know it, it's oddly charming, like a cat that hisses at you for three days straight before deciding to nap on your lap. You've called it Audrey "II", because it reminded you, strangely enough, of your crewmate Audrey, though this one is considerably louder, hungrier, and far less hygienic. The name also serves as a warning: this is Audrey, but more drama, more appetite, and definitely more vines.`
