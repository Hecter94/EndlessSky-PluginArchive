	description `"Furbel" is less a pet and more a portable pile of sentient lint that somehow developed a purr. It doesn't walk, run, or jump - it simply exists, vibrating happily like a warm beanbag with opinions. Furbel's hobbies include multiplying when you're not looking, rolling dramatically under furniture, and staring at you with the judgmental intensity of a thousand fluffballs. Owning Furbel is like having a living dust bunny that unionized.`

	description `Furbel's "kids" are basically copy-paste errors in the shape of squeaky pom-poms. They roll in herds, squeal like squeaky toys with stage fright, and collectively shed enough fluff to knit a sweater for a yeti. Together, they form a living carpet that judges you for daring to own only one chair.`

			`The market is overwhelming, a kaleidoscope of color, sound, and scent. Tents of every shape and hue stretch in tangled rows, their awnings painted with bold symbols and stitched banners that flutter in the hot breeze. Merchants call out in a dozen languages at once, their voices competing with the music of wandering performers whose drums and flutes rattle against the constant din.`
			`The air is thick with aromas: the smoky tang of spiced meats sizzling over open coals, the sharp bite of fermented fruit brews poured into clay cups, and the sweet perfume of candied roots roasting in pans of bubbling sugar.`
			`Stalls spill over with treasures both mundane and exotic, glittering piles of circuit chips sold alongside clay jars of honey, towering racks of iridescent fabrics beside cages of squawking bird-like creatures, crates of glimmering mineral shards stacked next to baskets of rough-hewn wooden toys. You pass jugglers tossing fire between them, a pair of lizard-like beasts yoked to a wagon full of salt, and children darting barefoot through the crowd with stolen fruit in their hands.`
			`Among the countless stalls, one catches your eye: small furball-like animals, chirping and wriggling in cages. They're being sold for 40 credits each.`
