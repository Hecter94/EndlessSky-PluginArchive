			`As your ship cuts through the atmosphere of this green planet, a sudden message crackles through your comms.`
			`"Unidentified vessel, this is planetary control. A shuttle has crashed in your flight path. We've dispatched a rescue team, but they're still minutes away. You'll reach the crash site first. Requesting your assistance."`
			choice
				`	Agree to set course to the crash site.`
				`	Is it a choice? You can't decline such an request, right?.`

			`Without hesitation, you agree. Adjusting your ship's course, you make a quick descent toward the coordinates. The planet's rolling hills and dense forests flash beneath you as you push the engines harder. The seconds feel like hours as you wonder what condition the survivors will be in when you arrive.`
			`You see it, billowing smoke rising from a small clearing. The wreckage of a civilian shuttle lies scattered across the landscape, debris flung in all directions. Your ship touches down with a soft thud, and as the ramp lowers, you grab your med kit and sprint toward the crash.`
			`A woman stumbles toward you, her face streaked with tears, clutching the arm of a little girl no older than six. She's hysterical, her words a chaotic stream you can't understand, but her eyes are pleading. The girl, wide-eyed and silent, clings to a small stuffed bear, too shocked to cry.`
			`Then you see him, the man lying still on the ground, barely breathing, his body twisted and bloodied. The woman points to him frantically. You rush to his side and drop to your knees, assessing his injuries. It's bad. Very bad.`
			`You work quickly, adrenaline sharpening your focus. First, you check his pulse, faint but present. Grabbing your kit, you stabilize him with a field med patch and begin chest compressions, willing him to come back. His breathing stutters, but he begins to stir. You administer a quick shot of pain relief and tend to the worst of his wounds, stopping the bleeding where you can. His face is pale, slick with sweat, but his eyes flicker open for a moment, just enough to see his wife and daughter.`
			`The woman, Claire, you learn, kneels beside you now, her sobs quieter as hope returns. "Thank you." she whispers, her voice trembling. The little girl, still clutching her bear, stands nearby, watching with wide, scared eyes.`
			`Moments later, the rescue team arrives, medics rushing forward to take over. They carefully lift the man onto a stretcher, securing him for transport. Claire grips your hand tightly as they prepare to leave. "Please, come see us. We'll be at the hospital. Please."`
			`You nod, promising you will.`
			choice
				`	Visit the family at the hospital.`
				`	You promised it, you have to show up.`

			`Two hours later, you visit the hospital, your mind still on that desperate scene at the crash site. When you arrive, Claire greets you with tears in her eyes, but this time they're tears of gratitude. She wraps you in a hug, a gesture so heartfelt it nearly knocks the wind out of you.`
			`"His name is Daniel." she says softly. "He's going to be okay, thanks to you. I don't know how to thank you enough."`
			`You see Daniel in the hospital bed, his face still bruised but alive, a weary smile on his lips. He nods in gratitude, his voice barely a whisper as he thanks you.`
			`But it's the little girl, Lily, who touches your heart the most. She stands by your side, shy and quiet, but her small hand reaches up to yours. In her other arm is the stuffed bear, worn and loved, with one ear a bit torn. She holds it out to you, her eyes wide and sincere.`
			`"This is Toby." she says, her voice barely above a whisper. "He's my best friend. But... I want you to have him. Because you helped Daddy."`
			`Your throat tightens, emotions welling up. You kneel down, gently taking Toby from her tiny hands. "Thank you, Lily. I'll take good care of him."`
			`As you rise, Claire gives you one last, heartfelt look. "You saved us," she says. "You saved our family."`
			`You leave the hospital with a heavy but grateful heart, clutching Toby the teddy bear, a simple gift that means more than words ever could.`
