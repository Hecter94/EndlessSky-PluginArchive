### uniques
<br>
<br>
Removes mass and outfit space from some uniques, puts others into unique category, or gives a png if there isn't one. Also adds lots of new uniques.<br>
<br>
<br>
Uniques are great! Why aren't more ingame? If the plugin control.station is installed, that station offers a job to see the status of obtaining the uniques.<br>
This plugin contains my former plugins unique.fix (just some vanilla unique adjustments), real.fluff (10 unique pets) and lots of new uniques with storylines.<br>
The plugin control.station adds info about this plugin.<br>
In the rootfoldet of this plugin you can find the file "plugin re-shroud.txt" to undo, what the nav buoys do.<br>
