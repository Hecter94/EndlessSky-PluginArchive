	`You wake up, confined inside the relative safety of an escape pod. Your eyes take a second to focus, and as they do, you become aware of a figure beyond the pod's glass.`
	`	A red skinned alien peers into the pod at you, mouth moving as they converse with someone out of view. They point to the base of the pod, mouthing directions to someone.`
	`	Air hisses as the pod's air pressure equalizes with the surroundings. The glass lifts and a reddish skinned humanoid peers in at you. "Are you okay, human?"`
	`	Realizing you understand them, you gather your strength and sit up. Your memory of events is fuzzy at best. The last you remember, you were onboard a long range exploration mission near Deep Space 19M5, hired as a scanning technician.`

	`	"You sure you're alright? Do you know your name?"`
	name
	`"Nice to meet you. My name is Sli'. Sli' Keelna'. One of our patrols found you drifting a few light years from our station. There wasn't a ship or any debris nearby. I can show you the logs if you want. I know you might not trust someone you just met."`
	`	"Anyway, welcome aboard Kalla' Eq' Station. We don't get humans here often. I'd advise you let my doctor here look over you, then we'll get you set up as a disaster survivor.  Iltan law provides resources to refugees like you. There's a ship and some credits with your name on them. Come see me in security after your med check and I'll get you set up."`
	`	After being declared healthy, you go see Sli' in security. "Hey. We set you up an ID and account." Sli' hands you an ID card, with your details written on it.`
	`	"Your ship is is bay six." Sli' says. "You're good to go. She's fueled up and you've been granted permission to use our portal gate, the Painted Threshold. The Iltan homeworld system is on the other side. You should go register as a captain there at the foreign embassy. Goba' Keh, Captain."`

		log "Factions" "Iltan" `The Iltan are an extremely advanced race of humanoids living outside the known galaxy. They are similar to humans, but with much denser muscles, reddish skin, and a highly developed nervous system that grants them quick reflexes and extreme dexterity. They're generally peaceful, but that is not to be confused with weak. Their past is as fraught with strife as any other species.`
