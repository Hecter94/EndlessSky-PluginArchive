	description `A small tugboat for recovering stranded ships with extremely powerful superconductor electromagnet clamp allowing it to easily align with other ship for docking and bring them along in hyperspace. Due to its' small size the TG-10 tugboat can only carry smaller ships like light freighters and light warships. Lightly armed and armored, not recommended for active warzone. Carries a small repair kit for repairing ship in-flight, can only be used out of combat.`
