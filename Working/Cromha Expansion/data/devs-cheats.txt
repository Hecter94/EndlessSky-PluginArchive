	description `You grew up on New Boston, that bland wasteland in the Dirt Belt. You knew early on that your dreams of owning a starship enterprise would never be realized by just working in a third-world sweatshop, but a few years of hard labor made you plenty of friends in just the right places...`

	`The bank's architecture is what you would have called "futuristic" back when you dreamed that the future would be less squalid than the present: story above story of curves and spires and balconies, all in gleaming metal. A doorman stands by each of the heavy glass doors. You are wearing your very best clothes, but you feel shabby next to them.`
	`	The fancy little banker in his very fancy suit is clearly trying not to show how scared he is of your laser pistol, but he can't help letting out a small whimper as he watches you shovel piles of credit chips into your sack.`
	`	A few minutes later you are on your way to meet a buddy of yours to get a face transplant and a fake ID. As he carefully injects you with local anaesthetic, he asks, "Now, what name did you say you wanted on that ID?"`
	name
	`	You give him a few hundred thousand credits extra and tell him to make you some fake ship licenses too, while he's at it. Then you sit back and try to relax as he surgically rearranges your face.`
	`	It takes a few weeks or so for you to heal enough to venture out in public, but by then the furor over the robbery has begun to die down. And thanks to your extensive black market connections, every ship and outfit in the galaxy is available to you here, including some that have not even been invented yet...`

		log "Factions" "Republic" `Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history.`
			`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
		log "Factions" "Syndicate" `The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
			`The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`
		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space.`
