	description "The Draining Rocket Fabricator is one of the greatest Lumbarian Fire Corporation weapons.It is an all-in-one fabricator that convert 4 Ion Missile into one powerful missile that is shot by the fabricator turret. The missile is already powerful itself by its enormous shield and hull damage but it will also drain the target shields and fuel over time by a noticeable amount."
	description "The only thing that may be missing to the Draining Rocket Fabricator is that it doesn't have any Ion Missile capacity at all integrated."
