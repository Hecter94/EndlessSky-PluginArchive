	description "The Lumbarian Ecthelion-Class is more than a warship, it is a Lumbarian World Ship. It is practically a mobile station that can carry 4 squadron of Gunboats, more weapon that you'll ever need and: a spinal mount that is a very rare gun port that lets you install extremely deadly weapons on it, such as the Particle Barrage Gun"
