	description "The Bulk Courier was a successful attempt of the Lifdot Industries to make the best Heavy Freighter that can be affordable to most of Empire Merchants. The Empire taken the Bulk Freighter and changed the materials like heavy metals to quatalant to make the whole thing more resistant to hull damage and other kind of damage like heat damage, burn damage, ion damage."

	description "The Colossus is a recent ship that is taken from the original Behemoth. It is basically just a bigger version of it. While it can carry a lot of cargo, it has also a great defense with his 14 turret mounts and its extra bays for Fighters and Drones. Even if it is meant to be an Heavy Freighter, it is categorized in the Space Liner ships since it can travel easily a dozens of systems without need of any fuel or people to help them out."

	description "With space for neither cargo nor passengers nor heavy weaponry, the Flivver's only selling point is speed. Flivvers are sold mostly to wealthy individuals who want to be able to travel the stars without needing to share a bunk room on a merchant transport with common people. This modified version of the Flivver was designed especially for a large growing group in the Empire Space: the space racers. These people organize races between different light ships and the rewards are huge."

	description "The Hornet looks like it is a modified version of the Wasp but it's actually the opposite: the Wasp is a modified version of the Hornet. The Hornet was originally designed by the Syndicate shipyards but at the end, it finished looking like the Wasp. The Lifdot Industries found the old plans of the Hornet and decided to finish this ship and to sell it. It don't have much difference to the Wasp, except its particular design."

	description "The Rancor was originally a pirate vessel, and many were used in the early turf wars. The Alpha War was the beginning of the Rancor's decline as faster interceptors quickly outpaced and outmaneuvered this relatively slower ship. Today it is seen as a relic of the past, most noteworthy for influencing the design of the Fury."

The only thing that makes him good is its price: a young man or girl can easily afford this ship to start a new life in the Empire Space. But now, this ship is mostly used by asteroid miners in the Empire Space. You will often see this ship with Arbiters."

	description "The Lifdot Dreadful is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a Empire Merchant squadron. Dreadful are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, but are capable of mounting much more powerful weapons. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."
