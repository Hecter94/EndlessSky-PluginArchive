	description "At the very first of the Mineria Colonies in the north of the Empire Space, they fought the Kor Efreti, a Korath species. Even if the Kor Efreti are at first pacifist, the Cromha Empire doesn't like Korath at all, you should know this. The Mineria Colonies started attacking small Kor Efreti ships to collect outfits and ships models. When they had enough ships hulls, they started restoring them to create their very own ships with their technology of them."
	description "The Empire Classik is a restored version of the Kor Efreti Charm Shallop. Even if at first, the Lifdot Industries wasn't able to reproduce this ship, they now can build large amounts of these ships."
