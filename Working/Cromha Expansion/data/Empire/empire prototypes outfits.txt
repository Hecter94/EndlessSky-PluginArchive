	description "This mysterious box sits quietly at the heart of your ship, thinking its own inscrutable thoughts. When it comes time to travel between the stars it sets off a nuclear fusion reaction powerful enough to level an entire city, and then somehow tucks the resulting explosion in between the folds of regular space-time like a wasp stinging an oak leaf to lay her eggs inside. Your ship rides the resulting ripple in the fabric of space."

	description "The Ember Wastes are an anomalous region subject to forces that defy conventional physics: Energy spontaneously pouring from the vacuum, material density far greater than one would expect to find in space - even around a nebula, a concentration of wormholes unheard of in the galaxy, and regions where the universe itself seems to be in flux. This region, more than any building or ship, is the Remnant laboratory where they study the deepest workings of the universe."
	description "	When asked to clarify whether the name refers to either ripping or crying, the technician looks at you with a curious expression, and replies 'both.' They then go on to explain that a very simplistic explanation for this weapon is that it is making micro-tears in the fabric of space-time, then cauterizing them together again. Should not the Ember Wastes cry at the necessity of such weapons?"
	description "	These massive weapons require special hardpoints, and are built in such few number that the Remnant distribute them directly on an as-needed basis. Due to the prodigious energy and fuel requirements, only the most massive of Remnant ships can support regular use of these weapons."
