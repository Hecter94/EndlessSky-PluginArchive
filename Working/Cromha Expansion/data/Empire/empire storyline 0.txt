They defend the empires systems in the core from the Syndicates and Pirates, but also from Empire Rebels, who often intercept Mineria Colonies transports. They are one of the most advanced military organization with their great ships and high tech outfits, that lets them dominate other major organizations in term of combat power. They created an Alliance in the year of 2973 with Hais, Wanderers, Quargs and Remnants."
		log "Factions" "Mineria Colonies" "The Mineria Colonies are in some way part of The Empire Navy. They are principally a products exportation company. They sell Mineria materials in the whole Empire Space for cheap prizes and also sell them to some allies to the Empire Navy. The Mineria Colonies are one of the richest organizations in the whole galaxy, they produced more than 4894B credits in the year of 3018. Contrarily to the Merchants, their ships have great defenses and great cargo capacity. You can find them everywhere in the Empire Space."

It is a pact between this different alien species and The Empire to protect the communication and all commercial stuff in the north space of the galaxy but also in the Ember Waste, to assure deliveries of primal materials to the Remnant, who are isolated of the galaxy. But also to protect Quargs from the Hielarchics and the Coalition. But for The Empire, it is just a way to protect themselves from all Korath species like Kor Sestor, Kor Mereti and Kor Efreti, hostile Korath species that attack them often in the Empire Space."
		log "Factions" "Empire Merchants" "The Empire Merchant is kind of an global organization like the Mineria Colonies, an organization that gives rights for trading, space traveling to people who are part of it. The difference with the Mineria Colonies is that, they are not a government and they don't own any system, planet or station. Everyone that comes from everywhere can be part of this organization and start they journey in the Empire Space not as an Empire worker, employee or anything like that but as a free Merchant."
