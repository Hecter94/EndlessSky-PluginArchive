	description "Korsmanath A'awojs, named in memory of the Korath home system, are massive nomadic habitats that hold much of their remaining population. True flying cities, they could be self-contained miniature worlds were it not for their heavy defensive armament and reliance on unsustainable materials, methods, and sources of power."
	description "	Commission of new Korsmanath A'awojs is a resource-demanding, labor-intensive, painstaking process fraught with political intrigue. Navarchs fight with the civilian government for resources and yard time they would rather devote to building raiding and defensive fleets, civilians vie with each other for a place on the next ship, and planning committees argue with engineers over what methods and technologies to use. This leads to construction delays, corner-cutting, and over-militarization of the design at best, and violent feuds at worst."

	description "The Empire Destroyer is more than just a warship: it is practically a mobile space station, with docking bays for an entire squadron of drones and fighters and enough crew to fill a small village. Although designed primarily for engaging enemies from a distance, a Carrier can also do significant damage in close combat."
