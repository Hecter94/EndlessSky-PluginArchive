# About Plugin:

Adds a new civilization to the Korath Space (now named the '[Empire Space](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/Regions-of-the-galaxy#the-empire-space)': [The Cromha Empire](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/Cromha-Empire). Also known as 'The Empire', it is a government that dirige a huge part of the north of the Milky Way. It also a very high advanced government. They are human but don't directly have contact with human Merchants, they have contact with the Syndicate, the Republic but they don't allow them to enter their territory. Know more about the plugin in the [wiki](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki)! (or test the game yourself) Also, there is another empire that is set up next to the Paradise Planets. It is called the [Lumbarian Empire](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/Lumbarian-Empire).
## This plugin:

* Adds governments that are related to the vanilla storyline (kind of).
* Adds another government that will fight the other one.
* The storyline that the plugin adds is made so it is the most similar possible to the vanilla one.
* Add new outfits and ships from different governments.
* Expands upon the existing map for exploration (New Systems in the north of the galaxy and near the Deep Space).
* Adds a new galaxy where there is Sheragis but it is still in work.
