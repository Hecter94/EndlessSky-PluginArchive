# Request feature & Report bugs
**Please, every time before reporting a bug or requesting a feature, check if there is not a duplicated issue(someone that had the same idea or bug than you).**
## Reporting bugs
You can report bugs by opening an issue [here](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/issues). Then select the "bug report" option. It will automatically create a pattern to help you making the report clearer. I will try my best to answer you the fastest possible and solve the bug.

It will look like something like this:
```
<!--⚠️⚠️Do not delete text that are in brackets. It's here to help you and they will disappear when you will post the issue⚠️⚠️-->

**Describe the bug**
<Describe with the most words possible the bug that occurred.>

**To Reproduce**
<Write the steps to reproduce the behavior. You can add or delete existing steps.>
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error

**Expected behavior**
<!--Describe what was supposed to happen instead of what happened to you. If not, delete this part.-->

**Screenshots**
<!--Add at least 1 to 3 screenshots if possible. It will help to understand more your problem. Delete this part if you don't have any screenshots-->

**Game Logs**
<!--Drag & Drop your endless-sky logs file. It should be in your [endless-sky folder](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins) and it is called "errors.txt".-->

**Additional context**
<!--You can add additional context if you want. If not, delete this part.-->
```

## Requesting Features
You can also request features threw the issues menu on the github repository that you can find [here](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/issues). Open an issue and select the "Feature Request" option. It will automatically create a pattern to help you improve your request and make it clearer to us.

It will look like something like this:

```
<!--⚠️⚠️Do not delete text that are in brackets. It's here to help you and they will disappear when you will post the issue⚠️⚠️-->

**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**
<!--A clear and concise description of what the problem is. Ex. I'm always frustrated when [...] If your feature is not related to a problem delete this part.-->

**Describe the solution you'd like**
<!--A clear and concise description of what you want to happen or what you would like to add. You can add code blocks, screenshots or draws to explain yourself.-->

**Describe alternatives you've considered**
<!--A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. if there is none, delete this part.-->

**Additional context**
<!--You can add additional context if you want. If not, delete this part.-->

```


# Adding your own code
First thing first, to contribute to the plugin you have three options: either coding your own idea and create a pull request, either create a feature request but not code it or last, helping on opened bug reports or feature requests.

To check if you can help coding anything, go to the [project](https://github.com/users/OcelotWalrus/projects/5/views/1) and check for issues with the "help wanted" label. You can propose your help here. Even if there is no "help wanted" label, you can still propose your help, all contribution is welcome!

## Coding Features & Add-ons
To code features in the base plugin, you can check the [endless sky github wiki](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins) to learn how to code things in the [endless sky data format](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/DataFormat).

The best way to contribute is [creating a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) of the main branch and code in this forked repository.
Note that you can create your own codespace and work on it if you prefer.

**You will find useful links to help you coding faster and better on the [discord server](https://discord.com/invite/tafa8dVH5Q)**

Here are some tips to code addons or create your own plugin:
* Always check the "errors.txt" file in your endless sky directory to find possible coding errors made by you or other contributors.

* Be sure to always code stuff that fits good in the base plugin (*in the same "theme" as the base plugin*).

* Keep your code organized in multiple files.

* Add some more details to your addons, to make it more interesting.

* Check the differents projects in the github repositories to know for what we need help or to find some projects that interest you.

* Use the github wiki if there is something you're not sure about.

## Apply your code to the base plugin
You can simply create a pull request that merge the branch where you created your work (a forked or a local repository of you) to the 'devs' branch. If you've done everything right, I should review the pull request and maybe add your very own code to the plugin.
