	description "This expansion seals off 1 ton of cargo space on the vessel where it is installed; effectively removing the cargo space from the vessel."
	description "   This expantion is typically installed on frontline battleships that cannot afford a reduction in acceleration and turning speed due to cargo."
	description "   It is also used in ships that are too vulnerable to carry cargo."
	description "Just not using cargo-space is relatively simple, but governments built a huge bureaucratic process around it to prevent sealed space from being used for smuggling."
	description "   Only some of the larger space-ports therefore have the facilities to perform the sealing procedures."
	description "Most ships that get this extention need more than one (to fill the whole cargo space)."

	description "   This expantion is typically installed on weak frontline battleships by captains that want to ensure that only well shielded and well protected ships are carrying passengers."
	description "Most ships that get this extention need more than one (to remove all passenger space)."
