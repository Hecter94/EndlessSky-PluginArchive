# Endless-Seas
 I think I picked the wrong "S word"

Jokes aside, welcome to Endless Sea, a total conversion mod of Endless Sky. The objective of this total conversion is to give Endless Sky a more maritime theme, with all the quirks that come with it.

Currently, this is a pre-pre-pre-alpha, and is extremely primitive in all aspects. Please direct all criticism to me; feel free to post reviews in the issues board, or even go ahead and PR your own contributions! I welcome all forms of help, trust me. Be it island images, balance suggestions, and so on; I'm very happy to get others' feedback, especially this early on.

Full tranparency, this is built off of an install of Samrocketman's fork, which can be found here -> https://github.com/samrocketman/endless-sky/tree/continuous-with-plugins
