Given that the Hai are generally quite small in comparison to humans, while waiting to filter inside you can already see some of what is going on inside over most of the crowd. It seems much of the line is not for the seating itself; it instead heads directly to the central stage where a group of official looking Unfettered Hai await.

			`	The soldier moves away, and a tense silence hangs in the air for a moment. The Chiefs turn from the audience to speak among themselves, while mutterings and debate seem to be spreading throughout the crowd. This subject appears something for which strong opinions are held. The volume increases as the Chiefs continue their aside, and you begin to notice some of the nearby Hai turning their attention towards you, some even pointing you out. It may be that you are not welcome here. One of the younger Hai to notice you, probably still an adolescent judging by her colors, approaches you directly.

You begin to introduce yourself to her in turn, but barely get your name out before you are both distracted as the proceedings resume. A child, younger, or at least smaller, than any other you've seen on stage so far, approaches the Chiefs. Also alone, the child seems scared and perhaps even lost as he speaks, so softly even those on stage must be straining to hear. One of the Chiefs breaks ranks to kneel by the child, comforting him as they speak quietly to each other. The Chief rises and turns to those watching to share the child's words, and Merora then translates it to you, "The child wishes to return home, to Hai space. However he cannot manage alone, and the Chief is asking for someone to escort him or find him a suitable transport. All Hai captains, even those who do not otherwise sympathize with our cause, would easily accept taking a child back to Hai space, without ever asking anything in return. It only needs to be arranged by someone, as the child does not know who to turn to." Progressively, every single Hai stands up and speaks, the message from each to volunteer clear. The Chief seems very moved by this, as a parent would be to see his child succeed in life. He designates one of the first to stand, and gently sends the child walking over to them.`
			`	The sun is almost set, and you can see that the Chiefs are beginning to grow impatient as the next Hai approaches and speaks to them. Merora tells you, "This request bothers the Chiefs quite a bit, as he is not asking for a child to be transported but a full family, and not from here into Hai space but the opposite. There are not as many captains ready to do this. The Chief said that currently no one is available. Later, they will most probably go and personally ask captains if it can be arranged." While Merora was speaking, the Chiefs had spoken amongst themselves briefly, and now one has moved forward to address the crowd. Merora translates again, "It is over.

			`You park your ship close to the hidden depot, as suggested by the Hai. You are still close enough to the spaceport to not draw unwanted attention by landing off-grid. These lesser-used auxiliary spaceports are often used by captains seeking a degree of discretion. Your crew should be able to intervene should anything go wrong.`
			`	You then follow the Unfettered captain to the hatch. He is well-prepared and quite deft, even given that he is wearing what seems to be a heavy combat suit.`
			choice
				`	"Who made this vault? What should I expect?"`
				`	"Should we not take more men to ensure our safety?"`

				`	(No time for talking.)`
					goto outsideship

Assume it is owned by unfettered humans, or pirates as I think you call them, and that we are ready to face them," he tells you.`
				goto outsideship
			label moremen
			`	"We are trying to be discreet here, not to draw attention! The larger our group is, the more attention and suspicion we attract. We want them to think we have no value, not that we're treasure hunting." Judging from his tone, this was a stupid question.`
			label outsideship
			`	Before exiting, he warns you, "Whatever happens, do not try anything stupid, and stay behind me at all times."`
			`	Once outside, you head for the mountains with him. He moves at a quick pace, and you have difficulties following him, especially with the terrain. He seems worried and keeps looking around furtively, making as little sound as possible with his suit. He is impressively stealthy all things considered, and you surmise the suit must have been crafted specifically for him in order to be so discreet. He presses a switch every so often which pops out a mirror, allowing him to peer cautiously around corners and obstacles in your path in case of an ambush.`
			`	You quickly arrive by a small local town that seems pretty recent. It's constructed with metal and other scraps the builders could gather, and is as deprecated as it gets.`
			choice
				`	"Is everything alright?"`
				`	"There is no need to be worried, that cache must be well hidden, right?"`
				`	(Keep walking, ready to reach for my gun.)`
					goto discreet
			`	You are not sure what kind of sign he just did, but it seems pretty clear he wants you to keep quiet. Looking around, you notice the two of you have attracted quite a bit of attention from the locals. While they all seem to have nothing to lose, the vast majority of them are very young and probably not the hardened criminals you had expected.`
			label discreet
			`	You both seem to be heading to a distant mountain, where you assume the cache is. On the way, you spot a local that appears to have gotten lost from the village, though you get the distinctive impression that something is odd about him, without being able to pinpoint what. As you get closer, more and more you get the impression that this vault is no simple, small depot. You pass several security turrets and assume that even more defenses are hidden.  You wonder why these turrets would be in plain sight around a "hidden" depot. You cross a ridge, and you notice some of your surroundings look... weird, like the mountain has only been affected by the elements at some places and not others. Suddenly, the Hai stops and raises a hand high up, palm open. Recognizing the sign, you stop.`
			`	The Hai reaches for some kind of device in his pocket and enters what you assume to be access codes. By the look on his face, it doesn't seem to be working very well. "Someone else has accessed the vault. This was not expected," he hisses as his grip tightens on his weapon and he dons his helmet. "Stay here. I will take care of it."`
			choice
				`	"Do you not want one extra gun, then?"`
					goto wannafight
				`	"What about the locals? They don't seem friendly. I just saw one nearby."`
			`	"Those lowlife scums? They would not attempt attacking a well-equipped warrior. Furthermore, there shouldn't be any around here, so far away from the village." He steps forward but then glances back at you, unprotected and armed only with a laser that seems like a toy in comparison to his. "Maybe you should come with me after all."`
				goto choose
			label wannafight
			`	"If the vault was compromised, it was not by amateurs. I fear those inside are more dangerous and well-armed than the locals. Still, I do not have to guarantee your security in any way, so you are free to do as you wish. The defense mechanisms are offline at the moment, so you would have to fend for yourself, but the locals are so young or frail that even you should manage it." You hear a tone of provocation in the last words.`
			label choose
			choice
				`	(Stay outside.)`
					goto outside
				`	(Come in.)`
			`	He sighs. "As you wish, but I hope you can take care of yourself on the ground as well as in space. I have disabled the automated defenses just in case they have been hijacked. We just have to go in, make sure they recognize us as friends, and then reactivate them." You really wonder where the vault could be, until you notice that part of this mountain in front of you is a hologram to disguise the entry. You both enter.`
			`	At first, you don't notice anything suspicious. The vault is clearly alien in origin, but you cannot pinpoint one race; instead it seems to be a mix of many. All of it is very, very old, and there is no illumination, probably because your friend deactivated the lights, but maybe even before that... At least there is space to move around - enough for an armored vehicle, in fact. As you acclimate to the darkness inside the vault, you notice a flash of light, far away on your left.`
			choice
				`	(It's just a light flickering. No need to worry.)`
				`	"GET DOWN!"`
					goto down
			`	It was indeed just a light flickering - from a laser sight, used to acquire a target: you.`
				die
			label outside
			`	It may have felt like the right thing to do at the time, but you quickly realize splitting up and then staying here in the open was not very intelligent. It is too late, unfortunately, because you get stabbed by a local pirate, who is no longer impressed by your now-missing armored friend. You can see his bloody knife, with what seems to be a snake on it, before losing consciousness.`
				die
			label down
			`	You get down yourself as you give the warning, then look his way to see if he followed it. The Unfettered was evidently trained for this, as he is already on the ground and sighting his rifle. You're impressed by the precision of that weapon as the sniper was quite clearly taken out with the first shot, but your armored companion fires three more times to be sure.`
			`	After searching through the vault to find other surprises, the area is declared cleared. Any other stalkers have probably run off after seeing the firepower the Hai brought. You then inspect the jump drives to the best of your ability with a device he gave you while he takes care of the security systems. Once you are done, you look around, waiting for the captain to come back, and notice a symbol, that looks like a dragon with multiple heads. You then go back to double-check the jump drives. When the captain comes back, he conveniently places his gun to hide the symbol. Best not ask him about it.`
			`	He switches a level and you hear that the humming of machines suddenly stops. "I have disabled the holographic field generator, meaning your ship can come and pick up the drives. Best have it come here to win time, in the hopes of it reaching us before the intruders come back, in force," he suggests. You quickly send a message to the <ship>, asking them to dock with the vault.`
			choice
				`	(Wait for the ship to arrive.)`
					goto ship
				`	"We could have just come into the vault swarming with ground forces instead of risking our lives..."`
				`	"Is this holographic field the reason we had to go into the vault in person, instead of just connecting it to the ship?"`
					goto vault
			`	"We needed to act discreetly so we would have the time to check the status of the jump drives without being swarmed by opportunist pirates. More people would have only attracted more attention and caused the pirates to use the vault's defenses against us for sure. As you have probably noticed, we did not have access to this vault for quite some time. Some unfettered humans could have snuck in and sabotaged the jump drives, like they did with the turrets." You have a hunch that there could be more to it than what he's admitting.`
				goto ship
			label vault
			`	"Yes and no. It is not only a holographic generator but also a set of jammers, meaning your ship cannot pinpoint the exact location, and would have to land blindly. We also needed to make sure the jump drives were not sabotaged, and that the vault was not compromised, as its defenses could probably have taken your ship down. Needless to say, even monkeys could rig the jump drives to blow when placed on a ship and used to jump, and checking that takes time. Besides, we want to keep using this vault for later, so we may as well ensure its safety. That said, it seems to be too compromised for further uses." You have a hunch that there could be more to it than what he's admitting.`
			choice
				`	(Go back to the ship.)`
					goto ship
				`	"If this world is so wild, why put the jump drives here in the first place?"`
			`	"The Unfettered are not the ones who placed those jump drives here..." He leaves it at that. The Hai doesn't seem to want to tell you much about this vault.`
			
			label ship
			`	As soon as your ship arrives, you give the orders to collect and either transfer the jump drives into cargo or install them directly onto your ship if possible, to be able to flee more swifly. When your ship takes off, you notice more activity both near the vault and in the sky, than on the way in...`
			`	The Hai comes to speak to you on the bridge. "It took us too long to transfer and install the jump drives, and we seem to have attracted attention. I guess if some of the unfettered humans got away from the vault, they have contacted some friends..." Multiple alarms start going off, confirming his suspicions - hostile ships are launching and heading straight for you. You launch as soon as you can, rushing through the correct procedures. Meanwhile, the Unfettered captain quickly joins you on the bridge, probably used to being where the action can be seen.`

We've never found traces of those particles before. I guess it could mean a shot got through and did some damage to one of the jump drives they are carrying - maybe even the one they use to jump. One thing is certain: these particles are not left by normal human ships, or Hai for that matter. My best guess would be that when the ship jumped, the hole it left behind did not close as quickly as it should, and anti-matter came from the other side. Perhaps it left these peculiar particles when being annihilated by contacting matter. Or maybe the particles just came through the opening in space?`
			`	"It doesn't matter much anyway. I suspect that they would have gone back to their base to at least take a look at it, so there should be traces leading to it. Something bothers me about this: from our experience, jump drives either work or explode, without any in between. Maybe it's because the jump drive is not actually being used, and is only leaking particles passively, that this is possible? Or maybe the damage done by these weapons is really special. After all, they are more advanced than what we have, or what the aliens up north possess. Only Quargs have a similar level of technology, and they invented the jump drives, so it could be some of these weapons are intended to disrupt it specifically."`

They are probably expecting jump drives, and more keep coming from every direction. Maybe they have not seen this Auxiliary yet, but only heard tales of it, or maybe this is what always happens when it lands, loaded with jump drives. Whatever the case, they seem surprised when they realize it belongs to you. They murmur with each other and then they start saluting, by rising one fist up. First a few do it, then more, until finally all of them are there, saluting in front of you in respect. You notice they are doing different signs with their hand.`

				`	"I have found Korath prisoners on the Alpha ship."`
			`	This seems to trouble them deeply. They are split between those who want to use the Korath for technological opportunities, and those who still remember too freshly the horrors of the Korath raids. The Chiefs are now the most active ones - some show scars or speak of lost family, others insult the Korath. Then, finally, one of them speaks up. He had not spoken until now, probably thinking. When he stands, you see many scars on his arms, and can only guess what he went through. He speaks calmly, yet firmly, strongly enough to make everyone listen. "We have lost much, so much. Too much... But so have they. And the raids happened long ago. They could not have been responsible for those. They are victims of that war as much as we are. They should be considered assets at the very least, not prisoners. They could help us against the soulless killers." This mention set off much murmuring, you can feel that not everyone agrees with what he said, but he has enough influence that they will not argue about it, at least for now. You wonder what the soulless killers could be, but feel like now is not the time to ask.`
			`	They discuss among themselves again, then the warlord from earlier speaks, seemingly with a heavy burden. "Now that you officially work for us, you will receive a daily share of 1000 credits. We will not make you wear our colors yet, because it could cause problems with the Hai. We wish for you to be free to travel in their territory." They then make the necessary preparations to transfer the Koraths out of your ship, after stabilizing them as much as could be done.`

			`You do a detailed scan of the Alpha base to see if there are any more jump drives or anyone who could have witnessed the fight. You cannot retrieve any information: it seems to either be too deep or at least shielded from scans in some way. You will have to go in blind.`
			`	The doors of the hangar open to let you in. Maybe it is an automated response to this ship, or whoever is down here assumed the Alphas won the fight. If there is anyone here, it's probably a skeleton crew. You and your crew carefully exit your ship, but you see no signs of life here. They could be hidden, so you proceed cautiously, looking for the jump drive vault. On the way you hear sounds - sounds that definitely did not originate from humans. Heading that way, you find a brig full of Korath slaves, with a lizard head displayed above the cells. They seem to have been prisoners of the Alphas, and you find what appears to be a crudely rigged translation device with them. They do not look to be in a state to talk about anything though, so you should probably go to Darkcloak and talk to the Chiefs about this. Hopefully the Korath will have recovered by then. You notice one has a very serious injury to his leg, it seems part of it has been replaced by a crude prosthetic. He may not survive the transport.`

You do find their captain's most recent log: apparently, they had indeed been waiting here to ambush you on arrival. You must have really scared them by scanning them in the Unfettered system to warrant such extreme response... Or maybe it's more than that.`

Thankfully, you were tougher than they anticipated and secured victory for yourself. Did the Unfettered know about this, or did Mera really think it was a jump drive malfunction?`
			`	You find a few squirrel symbols, and a fist that could indicate they forced them to. The Alphas seem to often communicate using simple symbols for their logs as a primitive code, on top of the more serious encryptions used for sensitive information. Going deeper into these recent logs of activities, you find a monkey symbol, with an eye. But it is not all, there is a symbol of a crossed portal, with a red skull icon.`
			`	There are also multiple flight logs. It seems they had been using this Auxiliary as a mobile base and for bringing jump drives to the Unfettered. These logs probably contain indications of where they have been getting the jump drives, but analyzing all of them will take more time. It doesn't take much, though, to notice they have spent significant time near Korath Exile territory. It is now time to leave the planet and go see the Chiefs.`

The fleet arrived and blocked its [escape, cloaking]. The ghost ship disappeared, but it was too late. One of the convoy ships nearby [rammed, crashed] into it, which costed the life of the proud captain but revealed the ship. Then it was just a matter of [shooting it down, damaging it]. The cloaking device was damaged in the fight, or maybe it was already damaged before, knowing the ship never [disappeared, cloaked] for long, so we could not extract it from the wreckage.

			`You can see movement in the spaceport. People seem to be heading to one place in particular, and you can hear some shouting coming from that direction. Do you want to go take a look?`

				`	(Not now.)`
					defer
			`	You see where all the Unfettered were going, and come across a large field where they seem to be practicing close-quarters combat, grouped in circles of different sizes. You don't understand all that is going on, but it seems like the bigger the circle, the more opponents you have to fight. He-Yi is standing in the biggest of them all.`
			choice
				`	(Go closer to see what's going on.)`
				`	(Leave. This doesn't seem interesting.)`
					decline
			`	As you move closer, you realize that the circles in the dirt are colored differently, but you're not sure what significance they hold. The Unfettered aren't all fighting with the same weapons - they move between circles, like in a huge dance. Some of them seem to have standard Hai weapons, but it doesn't look like they're deadly.`
			choice
				`	(Join the fight!)`
					goto fight
				`	(Keep looking.)`
			`	You keep looking around and are eventually attracted toward the bigger fight, the one He-Yi is in. He seems to be handling 6 younger Unfettered all by himself, and you most admit he is doing quite a good job at it.`
			choice
				`	(Challenge him.)`
					goto challenge
				`	(Try to speak to him.)`
					goto speak
				`	(Join another less risky fight.)`
			label fight
			`	You look at different fights and see one with less experienced, younger Unfettered who seem to be fighting in a less crowded area than the rest. As you come closer, they see your interest and propose you join them.`
			choice
				`	(Accept.)`
				`	(Decline.)`
					goto nope
			`	One of them comes toward you. "I challenge you, <last>! Tales of your strength have been spread, I want to test it first-hand. If I win, I demand you tell me those stories yourself." You are surprised he knows your language so well. He is equipped with what looks to be a twin pistol version of the standard Hai rifles.`
			choice
				`	"I'm sure those tales don't do me justice. I accept!"`
				`	"Very well. But if I win, I want your weapon."`
					goto weapon
			`	"I see the tales about your wisdom were exaggerated at least," he snarks, first in your language, then he translates for his friends.`
			label weapon
			`	He looks at his weapons, thinking. Then he nods and hands you one of the pistols. "I have set it on training. We wouldn't want any accidents to happen," he adds. He says something to his friends, apparently telling them to move away. Then he moves away to the edge of the blue circle. "Because this is your first time, I will let you choose your position and have the initiative. The rules are simple: once you shout, the fight begins." You understand why you heard so much of that earlier.`
			choice
				`	(Shout now to surprise him.)`
					goto start
				`	(Get into position and try to prepare.)`
			`	You carefully observe your surroundings, and decide to head toward one of the smaller circles. Everything is simulated to resemble an urban environment, probably because the original Unfettered had to protect their cities from the Korath. You feel the adrenaline of the coming battle surging into your veins.`
			label start
			`	You shout and try to shoot him... Except you completely miss him; you weren't expecting so much recoil from such a small pistol. It also seems to be wildly inaccurate. Obviously, your opponent knew this, and he is already rushing your way.`
			choice
				`	(Stay here and get ready for your next shot.)`
					goto ready
				`	(Go for the cover on the right.)`

			`	You try to head for cover, but he's too fast, and you receive a shot on your leg, making you fall. It hurts, but nothing seems to be broken, and soon after you cannot feel anything in your leg at all. You opponent comes to you and helps you to get up. "Pain is a good teacher sometimes," he says.`

			`	You actually manage to reach cover, thanks to him stumbling a bit on the approach. He was probably anxious to beat you... Now that you are behind cover, you have a strategic advantage, and he misses his shots. It seems that the pistol quickly runs out of power, and using this opportunity you shoot back at him. Most of your shots miss, but because he cannot shoot back and you are well protected anyway, you can take the time to aim precisely. You manage to shoot his arm and he drops his pistol. He does not shout at all when getting shot, simply sits on the ground on that position, showing he surrenders. You get out of your cover and grab the other pistol. "You can keep them; you've earned it. This was a fair fight, Captain! I'd like to try again some time, and maybe get my pistols back..." He then goes away and sits on the side, probably thinking about what mistakes he made.`
				goto heyi
			label ready
			`	You try to shoot him, but he's too fast and you too inexperienced. You have made yourself an easy target for him by standing still; you fall as you receive a shot to your shoulder. It hurts, but nothing seems to be broken, and soon after you cannot feel anything in your arm at all. You opponent comes to you and helps you to get up. "Pain is a good teacher sometimes," he says.`
			label stories
			`	 As agreed, you speak to him of many stories, including how you happened to find Hai space, and how you joined the Unfettered. He seems captivated by all of it, and so are his friends. Then he goes back to fight with his friends, seemingly in teams.`
			label heyi
			`	It seems like your fight has attracted the attention of many of the Unfettered, including He-Yi. He comes to speak to you. "That was a [nice, skillful] fight, especially considering this must be your first!"`

			`	"As you may have noticed, we do this [fighting, training] quite often. Because our rifles are not deadly on the first shots, we almost never have anyone get [killed, seriously wounded]. But it still happens sometimes, between some of the older, more fragile ones, and some young ones who can be too [enthusiastic, trigger-happy]... They shoot one too many times to make sure to [win, hit]. We have experimented with some less powerful versions of our rifles, but those don't reflect war well enough for our liking. Do you happen to know any weapons that would not have such weaknesses - any that would be non-lethal but still not meant for child's play? I would expect said weapons to be even [stronger, more useful] than ours."`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I think I do."`
					goto idea
				`	"I have no idea, sorry."`

			label idea
			`	"If you ever find any weapon that's [safer, less risky] than ours, please bring it to me. I would be interested to use them in training fights. I have heard tales of some who journeyed too far, excited by their newly acquired jump drives, and who came into contact with such weapons far into bird [territory, space]. I would not have expected them to use weapons at all, but maybe they too have [Unfettered, true] people that want to change? Those would make for great allies. Regardless, if you ever find such a weapon, could you bring me, say, fifty of them?"`
