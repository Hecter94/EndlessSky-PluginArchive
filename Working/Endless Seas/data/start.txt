	`You find yourself greeted by a strange man at the licensing agency. He smiles widely at you, gesturing to a touchpad where you can write your name. "Thank you for testing out the extremely early pre-alpha of Endless Sea! It's quite unfinished at the moment, but you probably already knew that, didn't you?" He supposes. You brush off his comment about this being a "pre-alpha" state and decide to just write your name on the pad:`

	`	It only takes another few moments for the license to be printed, but before you can leave, the man also sets a blank prepaid card. "100 million credits, on the house. Consider it your payment for being a tester for me," He says with a cheeky wink, allowing you to walk off and wonder why he keeps calling this an early test build.
