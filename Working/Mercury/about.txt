This is an entry for the Endless Sky Republic Heavy Warship Modding Contest.

Mercury
This is the balanced version, I think. Feel free to balance it for your game if you want.
This is a heavy warship designed to use the best human engines. This is the main idea behind the stats design.
It is a very fast ship with very high shields.
It has 4 particle cannons, 4 sidewinder missile launchers, 2 heavy laser turrets and 2 heavy anti-missile turrets.

Mercury Overdrive
This is the first stats version I created.
This version seems overpowered but I keep it here if you want to play with it.
This is the version I might want if it is a unique non buyable ship.

The ships can be bought in World Forge plugin human shipyard and in Navy Basics shipyards.
