	description "Mercury Overdrive is the ship built exclusively by a group of geniuses for a certain hero of the war. It is their gift for the one who upholds justice and peace in the galaxy. But then again, being the weird bunch of people they are, maybe they just want to build a very fast ship with very high shields and have just found a nice excuse to build one. Obviously, they overdid it."
	description "The Mercury Overdrive is one of the fastest and most heavily shielded human warship ever created. This is a ship built for speed with its low drag for its size. It is clearly made to allow for usage of the best human engines possible."
