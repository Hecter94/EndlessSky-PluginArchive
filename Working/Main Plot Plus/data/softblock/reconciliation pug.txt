            `You are directed to land in a hangar some distance away from the spaceport, in a cluster of buildings owned by Syndicated Systems. A team of engineers meets you and quickly and efficiently removes your hyperdrive and replaces it with a strange, alien-looking device that you assume must be a jump drive. "Now, be careful with your fuel gauge," one of them tells you. "This thing guzzles twice as much fuel per jump as an ordinary hyperdrive, and you don't want to become stranded while outside human space."`
            `"There is another wrinkle. Your ship's computer is only designed for travel along hyperlanes. To compensate for this, we have manually overridden your ship's map to include the last known location of the Pug homeworld system, Deneb, and the closest system, Delta Capricorni. With any luck, the systems will still be there. Now, make haste."`

A team of engineers meets you and asks if they can look over your ship; a few minutes later, one of them says in surprise, "You've already got a jump drive! How did you manage that? Well, we've added Deneb and Delta Capricorni to your map anyways, just in case you haven't learned how to update your ship's computer." Since you don't need their equipment, they urge you to head directly for Pug space and continue your mission.`
