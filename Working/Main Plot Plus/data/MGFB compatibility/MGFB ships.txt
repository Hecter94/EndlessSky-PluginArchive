    description "Originally heavily modified Tarazed Falcon by commissioned by some member of the Crossguard Patrol group to be used as long-range fast cruiser with built-in advanced sensors to fight pirates and catch smugglers. Now it's a complete redesign with some outline resemblance to the Tarazed Falcon. Unlike the expertly modified Marauder ships or Aplomado hastily built by pirates, the Eleonorae was optimized and constructed with some of the best tech in Human space, it was rumoured that some component is actually derived from confidential military-grade technology. This made it potentially the of the most advanced warship civilian could get their hand on."

    description `With the formation of the Free Worlds and them looking for carriers, MarStel Industries took this opportunity to convert the Tlielart into full fledged carrier however the development took too long and they were too late as the Free Worlds ended up picking others as their carrier. Though, thanks to its massive size it's capable of carrying enormous amount of fighter as well as larger carried ships unmatched by any other carrier at the time of its development. Due to this it got some interest as mobile service station for the Free Worlds patrol fleets and got adopted as part of the Free Worlds navy after some modification to improve its capability.`

    description `Republic Navy Spetum Class Fleetcarrier is a massive carrier that doubles as mobile headquarter projecting power not only within the system but also to nearby systems. Spetum Class is the first spaceship to carry a complement of fighters on par with wet navy carriers of 20th century. With over 5 times more capacity than older carrier fleets appearance of a single Spetum Class can turn the tide of a battle.`
    description `Public reaction was mixed, while the ship itself it a feat of engineering and a mark of progress in a way some thought the budget could've been better spent else where. Though the ship will be a major deterrence against pirates some were also concerned about the lives of fighter pilots who where often just cannon fodder. Nevertheless armchair generals were all at least somewhat satisfied with what they would consider an actual carrier.`
