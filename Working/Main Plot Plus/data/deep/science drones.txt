"I hear that you're not averse to taking on risks," he says. "I'm the lead scientist on a project studying a spatial anomaly in an uninhabited system nearby. We had just launched a probe to study the anomaly more closely when a band of pirates arrived and forced us to flee the system. Would you be willing to travel there and see if you can retrieve the drone's data?"`

Or maybe only ships that are specially attuned to its energy signature can travel through it. We don't even know if the wormhole is a natural phenomenon or some sort of alien artifact. Honestly, we aren't sure if it's even a wormhole at all. We'll need to study the data you've recovered to understand it further."`

"Anyway, thank you again for helping me. Hopefully we meet again in the future."`
