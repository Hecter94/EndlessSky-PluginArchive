            `    "Please turn your attention to this chart here," he says while pointing to a bar graph. "We've continued to track the number of new arrivals to Hai territory. As noted on the left, the number of new monthly arrivals was in the low hundreds prior to the leaks being broadcast. Within only a short time after, that number quickly rose to the thousands. Mitigation efforts by the Navy to dissuade civilian captains from discovering the wormhole in Ultima Thule by circulating reports of increased pirate activity have since suppressed this number somewhat, but the rate of new arrivals is still well above what it once was.`
            `    "It has been noted that the character of these new arrivals is also different. Where once a majority of new arrivals were lone explorers or lost captains, they are now increasingly captains following breadcrumbs while looking for the Hai or bringing large groups of 'tourists' with the promise of witnessing the aliens from the news reports. Further research will need to be done to determine the threat that these new arrivals pose in continuing to escalate the situation."`

We have grown acustomed to it. But if that trickle were to suddenly become a downpour, then our services would quickly become overrun."`
            `    The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Of importance is also the effect that this situation may have for the Republic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`
