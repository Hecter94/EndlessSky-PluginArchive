            `    The holoprojector displays a series of graphs. You're no expert in data analysis, but a highlighted "chance of total crisis" at the bottom ranging from 61% to 96% does not look promising.`
            `    "Please turn your attention to this chart here," he says while pointing to a bar graph. "We've continued to track the number of new arrivals to Hai territory. As noted on the left, the number of new monthly arrivals was in the low hundreds prior to the leaks being broadcast. Within only a short time after, that number quickly rose to the thousands. Mitigation efforts by the Navy to dissuade civilian captains from discovering the wormhole in Ultima Thule by circulating reports of increased pirate activity have since suppressed this number somewhat, but the rate of new arrivals is still well above what it once was.`
            `    "It has been noted that the character of these new arrivals is also different. Where once a majority of new arrivals were lone explorers or lost captains, they are now increasingly captains following breadcrumbs while looking for the Hai or bringing large groups of 'tourists' with the promise of witnessing the aliens from the news reports. Further research will need to be done to determine the threat that these new arrivals pose in continuing to escalate the situation."`
            choice
                `    "What's the problem with new arrivals?"`

            `    "We do not have the means of handling a large influx of humans," says the Hai. "For decades, we have dealt with a small trickle of humans arriving through the wormhole. We have grown acustomed to it. But if that trickle were to suddenly become a downpour, then our services would quickly become overrun."`
            `    The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Of importance is also the effect that this situation may have for the Republic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`

            label "block"
            `    "We could get the Navy to blockade the wormhole," says Alondo, "but such an overt action would be no different than outright stating to everyone that Campbell was telling the truth, which could easily lead to civil unrest after the events of the Pug invasion."`
            `    The man presenting the graphs nods in agreement. "Precisely my next topic," he says while pointing at another graph labeled "artifact penetration" which shows a map of various stages of events and their outcomes.`

Our most optimistic estimates suggest the Republic may be forced to acknowledge the existence of the Hai within three months, or we would lose so much credibility as to compromise electoral stability. The actual time limit is probably sooner."`

"Plus, while the Hai have let the trickle of humans that find the wormhole settle here peacefully, a massive influx is a problem nobody really wants to have to deal with.`

Complete containment of this situation may already be impossible, and so plans which aim for that may not be worth following. If so, we would instead follow the plans which seek to formally reveal the existence of the Hai to humanity in as controlled a manner as possible. Only time will tell if that is the case, though."`
            `    After the briefing is finished, the Hai woman approaches you. "Greetings, Captain <last>. I am grateful that you will be helping us. My name is Sayari. I was the envoy to the human government a century ago." The present situation is all the evidence needed to make it clear that the Republic has never mentioned the Hai, nor publicly acknowledged receiving an envoy from them.`

            `    Sayari chuckles. "So much on that human's mind. I have not seen him take a break since he has arrived. It is as if he is more stressed about this situation than any Hai."`
