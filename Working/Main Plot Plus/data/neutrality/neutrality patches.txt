        spaceport `The starport is a hodgepodge of small metal structures, built from the remains of Navy and pirate ships that fought for control of this world. The locals are unusually courteous and proud to welcome you to their planet.`
        spaceport `    The tavern in the center of the port is named The Parting Glass. Its walls are covered with photographs from after the war: liberated slaves boarding Navy ships to leave this planet that had brought them so much pain; Navy officers leaving their ships to retire on this world that they liberated; friends gone away; friends left behind. There are newer pictures, too: a Cruiser and two Falcons, side by side; armored troops walking away from a factory; a free worlds captain talking to a man. It is a strange feeling to sit here so deeply immersed in signs of a history that you had no part in.`
