Turner turns around and waves his arm across the crowd of people in the spaceport. "You see all the humans here? About one out of every four of these people only arrived here after war broke out through the wormhole. Captains who knew of the Hai came flocking here in droves after the Navy entered Kornephoros, hoping to avoid any troubles that the war would bring. Some captains returned after the war ended, but most stayed, and I see a massive market opportunity in that."`

Now that many merchants are here, they're trapped. They expended most of if not all of their ammunition trying to get here, and now they have none to defend them on their way back.
