    name "Delayed Start"
    description `You grew up on New Boston, an uninteresting world in the Dirt Belt. You dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of 15. After many long years of working at a textile mill, you saved enough credits to apply for a pilot's license from the Republic and buy your very own Star Barge.

    `Landing, visiting the spaceport, checking the job board, and viewing trades are all natural to you at this point, but you aren't planning on doing any of that yet. Today is different. Today is when you get to finally upgrade your ship. You head straight to the shipyard and sell your old, used Star Barge. Now it is time to pick your next ship.`
