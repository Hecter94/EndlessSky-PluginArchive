A defector from the Syndicate is claiming to have proof that the Syndicate was behind the bombings of Martini and Gemini. If that is true, the Republic may agree to make peace with the Free Worlds. But, refusing to return the defector to the Syndicate would certainly earn their enmity."
        conversation
            `The fleet in orbit around Wayfarer is pitifully small, surely not enough to take on more than a couple of Navy capital ships. JJ orders one of their communication officers to try to establish a secure link to Bourne or to any Free Worlds post on the other side of the Navy blockade. After about ten minutes, the officer returns and says, "Sir, we've received communications from New Tibet sent earlier today. You need to talk to them."`
            `    "Our fleet is there?" asks JJ.`
            `    "No sir, the Syndicate. The Syndicate has a war fleet in Alioth."`
            `    "What?" says JJ. He rushes into the communication room, and you and Freya follow. "Play the communication," JJ says. On the video screen is a Buddhist monk in a maroon robe; behind him, you see other monks rushing about with none of the serenity you would usually expect of them.`
            `    The monk explains, "I pray that this communication reaches the Council. Yesterday a Syndicate ship landed near our monastery, and the pilot sought refuge with us. He claims to have evidence that the Syndicate, or some faction within the Syndicate, was behind the attacks on Geminus and Martini. Evidence that a certain faction within the Syndicate values economic growth above all else," says the monk, "and incited this war for that reason."`
            `    "That's insane," says Freya.`
            `    "But not completely implausible," says JJ.`
            choice
                `    (Continue watching the communication.)`
            `    The video of the monk continues, "He was unable to show us this evidence, but he made claims of having plans for a nuclear device. After arriving he hid his ship in a cave, just before a Syndicate fleet appeared in orbit. They do not know where the defector landed, so they have begun searching settlement to settlement under the assumption that one is harboring him. They are currently here, wrecking the monastery in their hunt."`
            `    After a moment, JJ says, "If these allegations are true, if we can prove that the Free Worlds was innocent of any involvement in those attacks, the Republic might make peace with us, or at least agree to a ceasefire. I vote that we try to shelter this defector and hear his story."`
            `    "And if it's a lie," says Freya, "and we refuse the Syndicate's request, we lose our only ally. Many more civilians will be killed if we continue to fight without their backing, and we don't even know what this supposed evidence actually is. I care about justice, but trading a definite ally for a slim possibility of peace: that is an unwise investment. I vote that we hand this man over to the Syndicate."`
            choice
                `   (Continue watching the communication.)`
            `    You look back at the video screen to see that the monk is gone, replaced by a man in a Syndicated Security uniform. "Greetings, Councilmembers. I'm sorry for the confusion, but please understand. We're hunting a terrorist. This man claiming that we are the ones that caused the bombings is, in fact, the leader of the extremist group that caused them. He developed the nukes with the help of a faction of pirates looking to profit from the instability, and now, when we're finally close to capturing him, he's attempting to frame us for his own crimes against humanity. Allow us to find him, and we'll-"`
            `    The feed cuts off. "The message ended there," the communications officer says. The room falls silent.`
            `    JJ breaks the silence. "I still say we rescue this defector. The Syndicate could be lying to us. They don't exactly have a reputation for upstanding morality, after all."`
            `    "Or this 'defector' could easily be the one lying," Freya says. "I say we let them have him while we focus on defending against the Navy. If the Syndicate gets their hands on the true terrorist, their support will surely clear our name. Parliament won't be able to ignore the Syndicate vindicating us."`

We had to tell them before they destroyed the entire monastery looking for him." The monk then runs off to the monastery.`

"Greetings again, Councilmembers. I'm Officer Khalid," he says to you. "I take it you're here to help us search for the terrorist, but I'm afraid we already have him.

"We believe that the rest of the terrorist network he is involved in is located in the Core, so we have every right to take him into our hands. Using him we'll be able to uncover the rest of the terrorist network responsible for all this and prove your innocence in due time. Unfortunately, you may need to fight this war against the Navy for a little while longer until we have enough evidence." JJ shuffles at this response.`

At one point, JJ pulls you aside and says, "She must be a Questioner. How they operate is a tightly kept secret. I'd always assumed their methods were... a bit more medieval."`

They do slightly more effective damage, but more importantly, they have a much wider blast radius, allowing them to damage more ships at once. Additionally, as a safety feature, they only detonate if they will actually hit their target. Don't worry about an asteroid vaporizing your whole fleet."`
