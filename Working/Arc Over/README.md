This repository is for the Endless Sky plug-in "Arc Over". The plug-in currently encompasses all vanilla ships except person ships as well as ships not yet used in vanilla gameplay. As new ships are added to vanilla, this plug-in will be updated.

## About
Arc Over gives limited angles to turret mounts on vanilla ships, adding another balance aspect to combat gameplay. These arcs are determined by a few factors, and are given exceptions in some cases, some being more lenient than others, and others being no limits at all. For detailed information, see the `arc notes.txt` file in the data folder for general concept and specific choices for each faction.

## Download
For a "stable release", check out the Releases on the righthand side of this page and download the Source.zip file and extract to your plug-ins directory, so that there's the "arc-over-version#" folder in your plug-ins folder.
For getting the "continuous", which can be changed at any moment, click on the green `<> Code` button at the top right of the repository and download the ZIP file, then extract it to your plug-ins folder.

## Contact
If you find any bugs or issues with this plug-in, or have any suggestions, feel free to open an Issue in this repository, or visit the Endless Sky Community Discord server here: https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx and @Saugia in #plug-in chat.
