Arcs are determined both by the 3d model of the ship and gameplayability of the turrets in-game. Angles are done by tens. As there can only be one defined arc (i.e., from angle A to angle B), not all model structures are accounted for. For example, if a turret was blocked from both front and back - this would require two definitions, one for the left and one for the right. In other cases, a fin may be the only blocking sight, compared to notable ship structure. Generally, fins hold less importance than actual structural basis, to be more lenient for possible balance concerns.

Exceptions have been made for the case above, for less exaggerative model details, and for cases where no turret arc is necessary.


BELOW ARE NOTABLE CHOICES FOR LIMITED ARCS (OR LACK THEREOF). Unless otherwise stated, all ships with turret mounts have been given turret arc limits.


* HUMAN SHIPS

	* AUXILIARY - The Auxiliary has three different models for its variants.
		* Base
			- First and second turrets take account of the fin between them, and reside on a taller section.
			- Third and fourth turrets are on an overall lower structure, and take account of the taller structure in front of them (but cannot do the same for the rear). As a result, these turrets are more rear-friendly.
		
		* Cargo
			- Based fully on the overall lower structure. All four turrets take account of the larger rear section this time.

		* Transport
			- Based on the taller structure. Uses the same logic as the first two turrets of the base variant.
	
	* BARB - The Barb has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive. This also helps it be more flexible and strong as a fighter with a turret compared to mid-large ships with more limited arcing.
	
	* BLACKBIRD - The Blackbird has massive fins on the model and since we can't define more than one arc, the arcs are more permissive, not taking account of the outer fins as visual obstruction.
	
	* CARRIER - The angled wings of the Carrier model make arcing based on visual obstruction difficult, so the turret arcs prioritize the main body and rear instead.
	
	* CONTAINER TRANSPORT - The Container Transport has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive.
	
	* CORVETTE - The Corvette has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive. This gives it a benefit as a faster mid-sized ship compared to others with more space and weaponry (and limited angles).
	
	* DREADNOUGHT - Though the Dreadnought's rails are obstructive, it has been given some leeway, partly due to not being able to have more than one arc defined, and partly so it has an advantage/does not have a disadvantage compared to the Cruiser and other Navy ships.
	
	* ENFORCER - The Enforcer has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* FALCON - The Falcon's outer fins could possibly be obstruction, but have been discounted for the time being. Possible pending on balance differences with the Leviathan.
	
	* FREIGHTER - The middle turret is between two fins, so it would require multiple arcs. Instead, it's not been given arcs. Partly due to the Freighter being a cargo and early game ship, and also due to the other two mounts being more limited.
	
	* HAULER SHIPS (Including Carriers)- The rear turrets on Hauler ships are somewhat obstructed, but have not been given turret arcs. This helps the Hauler as a slow cargo ship with a more defensive rear section compared to other ships.

	* OSPREY - The Osprey's wings may give a slight obstruction, however the turret mounts were not given limited arcs. Like the Corvette, this gives it an advantage as a speedier less-armed mid-sized ship.
	
	* PROTECTOR - The two fins in the middle of the Protector are the only real obstruction and are relatively small compared to most other cases. The Protector has not been given any limited arcs for now, giving it a huge advantage over other larger ships with limited arcs, however it itself is very slow, and this is appropriate with its role. May change based on balance results with other ships.
	
	* SUNDER - The Sunder has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive. This gives it an advantage over other freight ships of similar sizes.

	* VANGUARD - The Vanguard has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive. This gives its turret more of an advantage over other large ships that have limited turret arcs, though it is still a gun-focused ship.

	* MARAUDER MANTA - The Marauder Manta's turret is blind to the rear half to not give it a huge advantage over other ships at this size/capacity, and takes into account the model. However, if it poses little issue, this may be lifted in the future to be unrestricted, giving it a bit of a cushion as a weaker mid-sized ship.
	
	* MARAUDER QUICKSILVER - The Marauder Quicksilver has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* MARAUDER RAVEN - The Marauder Raven has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive, also giving it a bit of a cushion as a weaker mid-sized ship.



* KORATH SHIPS

	* RANO'EREK - While limits have been given based on the Ran'erek's bulk, the rear turrets have not been given arc limits because they are high up and have open views. This setup means the ship is more well-defended in the rear, consistent with its utility aspect.
	
	* PALAVRET - Unlike the Rano'erek, the front turrets are well in the open. The rear turrets also hold centrality. Therefore, the Palavret has not been given any turret arc limits, but the rear turret mount may be reconsidered.
	
	* 'NRA'RET - The 'nra'ret has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* RAI'ALOREJ - The Rai'alorej has decent amounts of heights to structures, but in order to not limit the turrets too much, some of these have been softened. Most turrets take into account the frontal biome and rear bulk, with the exception of the one in the middle not being limited based on the former.
	
	* IKATILA'EJ - The front turrets of the Ikatila'ej find themselves in a decent amount of bulk and have been limited, yet some exceptions of specific structures have been given (such as a large dish). The rear turrets are higher up on platforms, and have not been given any limits, giving it a strong field for its backside.
	
	* WORLDSHIPS - There are six worldship variants with different models. Some soft exceptions have been given based on elevations, but a majority of limits are based on turrets having ~ 180 degree arcs for their given sides.
		* SPERA A'AWOJ - The rear turrets on the Spera are less limited compared to others, giving it decent rear defense as a transport variant.
		* IKFAR A'AWOJ - The Ikfar has good frontal turret angles and has a turret without limits, making it pretty strong in some aspects, though it doesn't have as much forward firepower as the Sapira (the battleship variant). Will keep an eye on these two.
		* KASICHARA A'AWOJ - The Kasichara has decent general angles compared to others.
		
	* KORSMANATH A'AWOJ - The Korsmanath has a combination of varying angles, shared angles, and turrets without limited angles, the main importance being that it has a semblence of left and right arcs now with this plug-in's aspects, which is impactful to the ship with the most turrets in the game.

	* ECHO-GALLEON - The Echo Galleon's first three turrets rise above the rest of its structure, and haven't been given any limited arcs. Meanwhile the rear turrets do have limits based on the surrounding structure.
	
	* ARCH-CARRACK - While the middle turret of the Arch-Carrack is somewhat lower than its surroundings, it's been given an exception and no limited arc as it's not significant enough and would require multiple limits.
	
	* CHARM-SHALLOP - The first turret on the Charm-Shallop has not been given limited arcs as it is not obstructed.

	* KAR IK VOT - The front turrets of the KIV have both rear and opposite-side blindspots but retain their forward-heavy power. Meanwhile, the rear turrets, based on the model, cannot fire directly forward but still have a large outside angle. These changes make it more specifically forward-focused, so will be keeping an eye on it, but it is a strong ship as it stands regardless of limited arcs.
	
	* TEK FAR LOK AND OSK - These two ships share model details from the KIV. However, if they were to use the same limited arcs based on the shapes, they would have an entire half of their firing circle as a blindspot. For the time being, these ships do not have limited arcs, but they may be experimented with these large blindspots in the future, considering they still have many carried ships.
	
	* TEK FAR 109 - The two turrets on the 109 have a soft exception to structure obstruction in the rear.
	
	* MET PAR TEK - The Met shares the same turret structures as the KIV (the six forward turrets), so it currently shares the same limited arcs (unlike the carriers). For a ship its size, 6 turrets is decently strong, so the blindspot given in the rear by this offsets this pocket warship.
	
	* MODEL # SHIPS - Each model ship has drastic structural obstruction and oddly-angled turret mounts (the modeled bases themselves), so a lot of soft exceptions and some decent ones have been given from ship to ship. Overall, the Model series has less forward-firing turrets (as opposed to their vanilla all turrets forward), with more arcs around the ships in varied angles. Will be keeping an eye on this, especially with ship balance vs. the Sestor ships, but in initial tests there doesn't seem to be a huge scale shift as of yet.



* HAI SHIPS

	* APHID - The Aphid has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* POND STRIDER - The Pond Strider has large obstructions based on its carrying arms. The front two turrets are limited by this, but as an offset, the rear central turret has not been given any limitations despite its surrounding obstruction.
	
	* SHIELD BEETLE - The first two turrets on the Shield Beetle have a good elevation, so they haven't been given any limited arcs, while the other two are limited as they are lower and obstructed by the large central section.
	
	* SOLIFUGE - The two inner turrets of the Solifuge are lower and obstructed by their surroundings, however, based on their weapon choice they've been given a soft exception. Overall, the other four turrets could not have limits overall as the obstruction for them isn't significant, so that could be a possibility in the future.
	
	* VIOLIN SPIDER - The Violin Spider has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* WATER BUG - Although it has a generally flat surface, the Water Bug has still been given a blind spot to the rear for balance reasons.



* WANDERER SHIPS

	* FLYCATCHER - The Flycatcher has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* AUTUMN LEAF - The Autumn Leaf has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* TEMPEST - The fins near the front turret on the Tempest would have slightly obstructed it, however it has been given exception and does not have limited arcs, since the rear turrets do and are deeper in the ship's structure.
	
	* HURRICANE - The top three turrets on the Hurricane (middle and rear two) have not been given limited arcs despite a small amount of obstruction. This is to help aside its slow speed and to accompany its power as a Wanderer heavy warship. Will be keeping an eye on this.
	
	* WINTER GALE - The Winter Gale has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive.



# QUARG SHIPS

	* SKYLARK - Though perhaps odd as the projectile sprite appears over the tall spires on the Skylark, the front two turret locations don't have obstructions for 180 degrees, one on either side. As for the rear two, they are on top of the spires, so they do not have obstructions and therefore no limits.
	
	* WARDRAGON -  Similar to the Skylark, the two outer turrets have some open space under a taller structure but the projectile sprite would appear over them. Nevertheless, limited arcs are used.



# PUG SHIPS
	
	* MABORO - Due to the Maboro's extravagant structure, the second and third turrets are directly behind obstructions. They've been given exceptions to fire past it as if they were higher, but still have limited arcs towards the rear end.
	
	* ARFECTA - The Arfecta has a grandoise structure. There could be many limitations or few to have with it, but considering the nature of the ship and its weapons, I've elected to not give it any limited turret arcs. All hail the Arfecta's omniscence.



* DRAK SHIPS - The Drak will not be getting turret arcs. All hail the gods of the galaxy.



* REMNANT SHIPS

	* ALBATROSS - The front turrets on the Albatross are at the level of the hull, so they don't have slight degrees toward the center but stop straight-forward. The rear turrets are on elevated wings, so they have arcs that go over the center hull but not to the rear. The rear turret has been given an exception and does not have an arc despite the wings as it would otherwise require two arc limits but would have a large operative area.
	
	* GULL - The Gull has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* IBIS - The Ibis's wings split the front two turrets and rear turret's arcs up a bit. The first two arc to the wings themselves, meanwhile the rear turret has been given a rear-only focus. As a carrier, the Ibis relies more on its fighters (and it also has guns), so the rear-specific turret shouldn't hurt it, and give it a niche in rear defense.
		
	* MERGANSER - The Merganser has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* PENGUIN - The Penguin has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* PEREGRINE - The Peregrine has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive. However, this may be a balance concern as this ship is already very powerful. It could get arcs that still visually work with the top-down design in the future if necessary.
	
	* PETREL - The Petrel has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* STARLING - The Starling has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.



* KA'HET - Ka'het ships have good turret placement, so there may be changes later based on balance concerns.

	* MAERI'HET - The Maeri'het's turrets are on top of its hull and would generally have no arcs, but for balance purposes, they've been given 180 degree arcs based on their sides.
	
	* TELIS'HET - The Telis'het's turrets are around the more bulky nose and have similar limits to the Maeri. However, the top turret has not been given a limited arc as it is above any structure.
	
	* VARETI'HET - Like the Maeri, the Vareti's turrets are on the top and would generally have no arcs, but for balance purposes have 180 degree arcs based on sides.



* COALITION - Due to the varying structural heights, lengths, etc., in Coalition ships, arcs may differ from ship to ship even within the same design group.

	* ARACH FREIGHTER - The Arach Freighter has a very bulbous middle section, with the turret platforms being on the sides. Unlike other ships with simple arcs, these don't have a slight offset to the forward or rear points, but are direct 180 degree arcs.
	
	* ARACH HULK - The side turrets on the Hulk retain a similar reasoning and implementation of 180 degree angles like the Freighter. Meanwhile the first and last turret have not been given limits as the stucture near them is not significantly obstructive.

	* ARACH SPINDLE - The Spindle shares the same first and last turrets on the Hulk, therefore for the same reasoning it doesn't have any limited arcs.
	
	* HELIARCH BREACHER - The Heliarch Breacher has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.

	* HELIARCH HUNTER - The Heliarch Hunter has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* HELIARCH JUDICATOR - The Heliarch Judicator has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* HELIARCH PUNISHER - The front three turrets of the Punisher have been given arcs taking into account the structure behind them and also have been limited for balance purposes, but the fourth rear turret has not been given an arc.

	* HELIARCH STALKER - The Heliarch Stalker has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* KIMEK SPIRE - The first and second turrets on the Kimek Spire have basic limits, but the rear ones are blocked by some foward structure and are a bit more odd. Their limits are slightly skewed from straightforward, so the ship cannot fire them both at a forward target (unless it is big). This limit seems acceptable for a civilian ship, but may be given a soft exception in the future for balance reasoning to have direct forward firing.
	
	* SARYD SOJOURNER - The turret mount setup around the forward struture of the Sojourner sees that the side ones cannot turn past the center section, and the middle one is a bit higher, so it shares both limits towards the rear. Meanwhile. the rear turret has obstructuve structure forward and has a blindspot there, making it more rear-focused, seemingly appropriate for a civilian ship.
	
	* SARYD VISITOR - The single turret location is lower into the Visitor's structure, and would require having small forward and rear arcs. Instead, it hasn't been given an arc limit, giving it a comfortable turret mount for a ship its size, which is an acceptable balance.
	


* SHERAGI SHIPS

	* EMERALD SWORD - Most turrets on the Emerald Sword have been given limited arcs, but the highest one has not been as there are no obstructions.



* BUNRODEA SHIPS

	* SASUMATA - The Sasumata's turrets are on the very top, and although are on a slightly slanted structure, have not been given limited arcs as the structure is not significantly obstructive.
	
	* TANTO - The Tanto has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.
	
	* ARAREBO - The forward turret on the Ararebo is on a lower structural deck than the others, and has been given a rear blindspot. The other three turrets are on the top of the ship and unobstructed, and have not been given limits.
	
	* TEKKAN - The Tekkan's structure and turret locations are a bit odd; the front one is on a lower platform. For the time being, it's been given a forward-focused limit due to the structure obstructions surrounding it, but may be given a soft exception in the future. The side turrets are obstructed by the body and have been given limits around 180 degrees on the sides.
	
	* KAMA - The Kama has not been given limited arcs as the structure is not obstructive.



* GEGNO SHIPS

	* DUNITE - The Dunite has a strange turret workaround for its melee weapon; in order to work efficiently, it hasn't been given a turret arc.
	
	* GNEISS - The structure surrounding the turret mounts on the Gneiss could be given many different limited arcs, especially if considering soft or no exceptions. Rather than make very specific limits, they have been given some general limits. This might be revisited in the future.
	
	* FELDSPAR - Normally, the Feldspar's turrets could be considered obstructionless due to their height above all else, but the angle at which the hull is at technically would limit a full rotation. They have been given this limitation, also as to not have a powerful limitless weapon operation, since despite having two turrets, the ship's strength is bombardment from afar. This shouldn't hurt its purpose as it is meant to fire mostly from the front.

	* EPIDOTE - The second and third turrets have not been given limited turret arcs as they are not obstructed, unlike the lower-positioned first turet.



* RULEI SHIPS
	
	* The Rulei will not be getting turret arcs. Their weapon mounts would defy structural restriction, should any even exist.



* SPACE LIFE

	* Similarly to the Gegno Dunite's special-case melee weapon, space life weapons that use turrets as offensive means do so outside of the influence of structural obstruction, and therefore have not been given limited arcs.
