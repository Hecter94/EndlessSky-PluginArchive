            `You are wandering around Foundry's capital city when you come across a building marked "Bounty Hunters' Guild."

"You got the guts to be a bounty hunter? If you kill this man, you get free admission into the Guild and a pretty sweet payment at the same time, if you can get him. He's the most slippery criminal in the Core, and he's killed many of us."`
