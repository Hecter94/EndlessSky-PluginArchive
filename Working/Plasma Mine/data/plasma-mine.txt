	description "The Plasma Minelayer was designed by Cavalier Constructions ('It may blow up!') on Prime. They saw a major gap in galactic weaponry and filled it. Now you can drop a nasty surprise for ships following you, or establish a minefield and lure your enemies into it. But don't take too long - due to the mines' small size, the plasma on board can only be maintained for so long, after which it will explode in harmless but spectacular fashion. As with other plasma weapons they do heat damage, so even a large ship will be disabled if it runs into enough of them."
	description "	Because mines are dropped from the rear of the ship they take up engine space rather than weapon space. Control equipment to help maintain deployed mines' plasma fields will fill a turret port."
