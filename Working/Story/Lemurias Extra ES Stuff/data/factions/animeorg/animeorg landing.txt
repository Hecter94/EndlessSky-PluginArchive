			"You've landed on Eisei. Unlike the nearby Sayari Plushie Authority colonies, this is owned by a different organization. As usual, your ship is refueled. Suddenly, an announcement plays."
			`			"Screenings of 3 randomly selected animes will begin in 5 minutes. Attendance is free. The anime being screened is not protected by copyright - copies of it may be attained by asking for it from any officer in a brown uniform."`
			"The worker asks you a question. 'Do you want to attend?', he says."

			"You decide to attend the screening. Reading directions on a poster, you walk to the theater. Many people walk alongside you, from the disreputable-looking to well-dressed people. Some of them have rifles, but you don't think of it. Some people in the crowd buy snacks and drinks, while you go straight to the cinema. You're briefed on the rules, such as remaining quiet at all times, not littering."
			"The anime they screen is good. After what feels like a few hours, the screening concludes as the end credits roll and you return to your ship, ready to leave."
