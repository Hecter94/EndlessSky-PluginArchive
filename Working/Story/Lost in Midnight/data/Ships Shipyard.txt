	description `Some captains refer to this ship as the Hauler IV plus II in reference to the inconvenience of loading or unloading the two upper cargo compartments in non low gravity environments.`

	description "Locals started making these in their backyard garages to satisfy a limited demand for unofficial combat drones. From a distance, it looks like someone duct taped an energy blaster to the side of a civilian science drone. Upon closer inspection, that assessment isn't too far off. Each drone has minor differences in construction materials and how the wires are routed. Few pirates actually use these, but the ones who do tend to buy them in bulk."
