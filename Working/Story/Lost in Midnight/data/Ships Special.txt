Rumor has it that the project scope shifted focus during development when a ship of alien origin was discovered at the edges of the Rim. As a result, the planned fighter bays were scrapped in favor of the concentrated fire mount. This design crams all of the ship's gun ports into a single central location, allowing multiple smaller guns to emulate the effect of having a single larger one. This negatively impacts the ship's cooling efficiency and increases the amount of work maintenance crews have to put in for guns not mounted on the edge of the cluster."

	description `A leftover from the Alpha Wars, War Hauler production stopped soon after the wars ended. Although the ship predates the Republic and is not manufactured by any modern shipyards, Parliament still passed a law prohibiting retail sales of this ship to ordinary civilians. This has made the few remaining War Haulers on the secondary market a highly sought after item amongst collectors of antique ships."`

	description `Among the largest models of all city ships, a Metropolis is formed through the combination of three smaller city ships. An emergency separation feature is supposed to allow the three ships to act independently. However, that feature is currently malfunctioning with this particular Metropolis ship. Perhaps one day, you will find an engineer who can figure out how to unfreeze the binding clamps without destroying the ship in the process.`


# The District, Prefecture, and Municipality ships can only be acquired by aborting final delivery of each ship during Metropolis missions.

	description "The District ship comprises the aft portion of a Metropolis ship. It features the most outfit and cargo space of the three sections as well as the most weapons. While it does not have a proper fighter bay, a small landing pad on the roof is outfitted with a docking port and clamps, allowing a support fighter to latch onto its back. The afterburner provides additional thrust to jumpstart movement for the bulk of a Metropolis ship in its combined form."
