# notes

- ScS Corporate Friends 2: would have on-visit "the battle continues overhead; if you have jd can fit and go; else carry on fighting (they may have one left over)"
	+ but can't start 2 and 2U/C on same 'yes okay then' choice
- Corporate Friends JD: don't offer JD if already got one?
- Dialogue if visit Pug before Pug Support 1 would be good, but logic gets complicated
	+ (ScS Pug Visit 1, if travel to deneb: usual dialog with pug, tailored for ScS; leave in confusion and suspicion)
- ScS Corporate Friends 2: catching a disabled pug seems pretty hard. have made pre-disabled, but would prefer just to balance better
- ScS Corporate Friends 1: Rarely, enough missiles and proton guns can prevent the alphas from escaping. Could fix with a scram-jump-drive, or maybe with massively increased mass and thrust/turn
- ScS Tracking 3 trak-not-work message.
- make `event "stack core for sale"`?
- set `free worlds reconciliation`?
	+ yes: this might be taken to mean: the galaxy-history worked out this way; this+`free worlds plot completed` means you did that particular storyline
- [todo] paradise worlds remain restricted... raise rep with republic to fix?
