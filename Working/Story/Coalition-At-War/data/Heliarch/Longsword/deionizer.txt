    description "This Quantum Deionizer makes you virtually immune to ion damage at a high cost. The ion sheath it creates gives a 10% reduction to shield & hull damage. It slows down your ship A LOT, uses a lot of WEAPON space, and might be the hottest outfit. Is immunity worth it? I don't know. Seems like someone could just kill you with a flamethrower."
