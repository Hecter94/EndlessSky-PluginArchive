This plugin provides easy to identify images which help you identifying minable asteroids.
The two main files are images/asteroid/common/spin-98.png and spin-99.png.
These two files have been duplicated to spin-90.png to spin-97.png, respectively.
These files then have been added to the folders images/asteroid/gold/, iron/, lead/, silicon/, silver/ and titanium/.
The folder images/asteroid/common/ is not used by the game, it serves only as base folder for symlinks.

The numbers 90-99 have been chosen to not interfere with the existing images which have lower numbers.
If you wish for a longer visibility of the hints, simply duplicate the spin-9? block into a spin-8? block in the folder of your choice. I.e. if you want a better visibility for the "gold" minables, duplicate the spin-9? files in that particular folder.
