	description `This miniaturized model of radiothermal generator is small enough to be installed on even a fighter. Its heat generation is significantly higher when compared to something cheaper, such as a fuel cell, which will likely require some sort of cooling system on a smaller craft.`

	description `Small enough to even free up some room in a drone, this slightly less efficient but small version of the usual RTG can free up some room in a small ship. Besides its price, Its heat generation is still triple that of what a fuel cell of similar size would be, which on a tiny enough ship may cause the room freed to just be taken up by cooling.`
