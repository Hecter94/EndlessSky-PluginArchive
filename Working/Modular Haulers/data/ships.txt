	description "In response to the increase in pirate attacks over the course of human galactic activity, Southbound Shipyards have revisited the basic Hauler concept and, in realising its modularity, have developed new pods to be fitted onto it, in addition to upgrading the engine block to be capable of reverse thrust."
	description "The Hauler I: Type W, or better known as the Brawler, is fitted with a battle pod that, at the cost of cargo space, comes packed with extra outfit space, more shield projectors, and an extra turret mount, allowing for merchants to brave the more dangerous trade routes of human space in relative safety."

	description "In keeping with the trend of Haulers with increasing amounts of pods, Southbound Shipyards have also created the Hauler II: Type W, otherwise known as the Brawler II, which comes equipped with two battle pods and the accompanying outfit space."
	description "Realising the danger in a ship that can go toe to toe with, or possibly even take out, a Navy Frigate, the Free Worlds have asked Southbound Shipyards to limit the sale of these ships to holders of its Militia license only."

	description "Originally, Southbound Shipyards chose not to make the Hauler III: Type W, but the Free Worlds council saw a use for it in being a heavy patrol craft that can hold its own against all but the largest pirate fleets, spurring Southbound to develop it and thus, the Brawler III was born."
	description "Of course, being the most heavily armed of its brethren, Southbound did not need to wait for the Free Worlds to tell them to restrict its purchase to only its Militia, lest the Free Worlds will be fighting the ship piloted by the very people they were hoping to curtail."

	description "While mainly trying to breathe new life into an old design, part of the reason for Southbound Shipyards' creation of modular pods for the Hauler was to have something to compete with the Navy's Auxiliary, which they have achieved after realising the modularity of the very ships they were trying to improve."
	description "This particular model, known as the Hauler I: Type T or simply the Crawler, comes equipped with a transport pod, effectively making it a space train, along with slightly more outfit space and Southbound's upgraded engine block, allowing for reverse thrust capability in addition to extra speed."

	description "The final version of the Hauler III: Type T, or simply the Crawler III, this model comes with three transport pods. A misjudgment in design resulted in the plume from the reverse thrusters burning right alongside the windows of all three models, which was rapidly deduced to have no negative side effects due to the hull properties and so was left there, much to the enjoyment of young passengers."

	description "Created at the behest of one of the board members of Southbound Shipyards, whose only motivation was the phrase 'hehe funny small man,' the Hauler Zero turned out to be quite the capable warship when not bogged down by a heavy cargo pod. Shown to be able to hold its own against groups of Interceptors with its array of turrets, engineers at Southbound came to call it the Mauler, which soon caught on."
	description "While lacking the increased outfit and engine space and the reverse thrust capabilities of its new Brawler and Crawler brethren, the Mauler remains a force to be reckoned with."
