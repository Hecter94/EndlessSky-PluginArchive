	description `This ship is a modified version of a captured Navy Gunboat. Although there is little most pirates can do to improve the already advanced shielding, they can still weld on a few extra hull reinforcements and an extra pair of guns. This gives them a tough and reasonably fast gun platform to quickly attack, plunder, and escape.`
