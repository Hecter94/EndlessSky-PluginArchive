planet "Sine Cogsmyer"
	description "A generally dry planet with expansive and very shallow ocean that gets dried up during the day and rains at night. Giant tracked machines prowling through land and sea digging up ores and minerals which then collected by freighters to be transported back to the factories."
	spaceport "The spaceport is a massive steel building built over a mountain with numerous bays and landing pads enough to service several battlefleets at a time. Many landing pads also appears to double as construction yard with complete set of cranes for installing massive turrets that are easily over a hundred tons each. Always alive day and night filled with all sort of craftmens constantly servicing and builting new ships."
	spaceport "Human accommodation however, is a large contrast to ship-related facilities, most restaurant are a small hole-in-a-wall area cramped and often full of people. Food either taste bland or too extreme that you have to mix them to get something more editable. Peeking over the counters reveal mostly reheating machines and boxes of precooked food."
	spaceport "The spaceport is always crowded with countless people despite the relatively wide path, each walking at brisk pace towards their destination. You can't spot a single person who isn't rushing somewhere. More distant transport is often done by trains and occasionally repulsor crafts, you also noted that repulsor engines used around here are entirely different from ones on your ship."
