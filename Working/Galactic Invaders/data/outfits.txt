	description "This mega lazer was made in an attempt to eradicate humanity and all of its worlds. It is so big, its pretty impractical because if your ship can fit one, it wont have room for any other weapons. It also must fire in short bursts because of the amount of heat and energy it takes up, making it almost useless against a large group. It does make up for this with its large amount of damage. It was built to destroy planets, so destroying large ships such as a cruiser is no problem. It is so powerful the back end of it has to be open to let some of the lazer out or the ship will disenegrate and dissapear just like you did with your parents... Why did you just buy a spaceship and leave?"
