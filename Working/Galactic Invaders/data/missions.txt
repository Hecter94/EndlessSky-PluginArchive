			`When you land the planet is completly deserted. At a first glance, it looks like nobody has been here for centuries, but as you look closer, you can tell that it was abandoned in a rush and very recently.`
			`The merchant (You still dont know his name) who you brought here suddely gets off your ship exitedly, but as soon as he looks around at the abandoned planet, that exited look on his face quickly turns to dissapointment. "Its just an abandoned planet...", he says as he sadly walks back into the ship.`

				`"This is weird... When I was here before, it was packed with people. Lets go looking for them."`
			`You hear him from deep inside your ship, "Sorry, but im leaving". You whip around to look at your ship and see him in the captians seat. Suddenly, the ships engines turn on. "You have 30 seconds to get in this ship or you will be trapped here for the rest of your life, which will be short if that happens." You sprint for your ship and make it in. Just as you are about to close the door, you see one of the aliens appear by an abandoned food cart. He seems ro recognize you and begins sprinting in its slow stubby legs for your ship. The merchant also seems to notice this because the door starts shutting before your 30 seconds is up.`

			`"Sure, I guess", He says and slowly gets off your ship with his camera. As you keep looking for where they went, he slowly wanders off, snapping pictures of anything interesting.`

			`You ignore the food cart and slowly creep tword where you saw the movement. The closer you get the more you can hear a conversation. It seems to be getting more heated and louder until it turns to shouting. One of the voices is the merchant you brought here. "no, No, NO IM NOT HIM, MY NAME IS M-" He is cut off by some odd electric sound and a loud scream.`

			`Before you can do anything you are cut off by one of the aliens who should live here, pointing something at you which you assume is some kind of gun. "Are you escaped human?" It screeches at you. Not like how a human would screech at you, like an actual screech.`

			`Finally, a merchant captian approaches you.`
			`"Hello, I was told you can bring me to those systems on the west branch of the galaxy. Nobody has ever had enough fuel to make it to any planet that you can refuel on. Also, I want to check out that planet everyone is calling broadcast." He says and quickly runs off. You wonder if he was acually the person you were supposed to meet when he comes back, "Oh, wait, I dont know where your ship is."`

				`"Nope"`

				`"What would you do if I said yes?"`
			`"Thats what I thought. I also think you deserve an explaination." He seems to wait for a response then adds, "I think I should start with why the planet was deserted." He seems to think about where he should start, then says, "My species has a kind of comm network implanted in all of us when we are born so that we have a efficient way to get a message around to our entire species to quickly warn of an attack or some emergeny, which are very loud and you cant hear anything else. A couple days before you piked me up, one of those signals went out telling everyone to evacuate to our base planet and all forces that can fight must defend that system. Most people thought it was another attack, but I am part of their government. Where I am is complicated so dont ask. I knew that there was a emergency protocall for if a human escapes our systems. It was to do that exact thing. Inluding not tell anyone why. I also knew that humans arent so stupid that they would just attack some unknown species, which also brought up the question of why our government would use that protocall, but that was beside the point at the time, so, I stayed at the planets space port for your ship to return and you know the rest."
