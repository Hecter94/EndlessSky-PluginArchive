	description "Refineries utilize this device to separate impurities from harvested gaseous elements and process it into a liquid or solid for easier storage."
	description "	It can also be used during fuel transportation. In rare situations, a sudden change in temperature can cause fuel to expand or contract, resulting in burst fuel tanks. A Fuel Stabilizer can help protect fuel carried during transport by regulating its state as a solid, liquid, or gas."
