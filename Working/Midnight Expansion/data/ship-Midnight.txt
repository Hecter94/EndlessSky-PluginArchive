	description "The Avialae is an early example of Remnant ship development. Its design function still has traces of principles from ancestral human space. As they acclimated to life in the Ember Wastes many Prefects determined that mass production of big Utility ships was a waste of resources. Instead they chose to focus on filling their fleets smaller, more specialized, models."

	description "Shortly after development of the Starling, Remnant ship crafters attempted to apply the design principles they learned towards a medium warship. The Magpie was one functional result of this endeavor."
	description "	There was an unforeseen problem with trying to apply the alien cloaking technology they had access to with a bigger ship: a noticeable increase in consumption of energy and fuel. Until the shipyards solve this problem, larger ships with cloaking will remain a rare sight in Remnant fleets."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Magpie's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship."

	description `The Wretched Hive is a Protector that was heavily modified by pirates to act as a carrier. The gun ports were removed while the remaining internal weapon circuitry was rerouted through the cargo bay to make space for housing a swarm of drones. Thick armor plating has been added to the hull while additional engine space was made available to offset the added mass and drag.`
