	description "The Garbage Scow is an ancient ship: developed hundreds of years ago to transport radioactive materials across human space, it had lost importance with the introduction of generalised and better armed haulers like the Bulk Freighter and the Behemoth. Some still operate legitimately, carrying waste away to designated disposal sites. But many of these freighters have wound up in the hands of smugglers after the discovery that the internal structure of their Radiological Containment cylinders are very efficient at hiding cargo from being scanned."
