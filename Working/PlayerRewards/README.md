# PlayerRewards
Get rewarded for playing in Endless Sky

## How it works

You will get a special mission when you go and land on New Wales,

Basically go to Earth from there and then you should enjoy a somewhat balanced salary of credits per day.

> I didn't want to make it too much or then the game get's rather boring. (Also didn't want to make it too little else you really don't gain anything)

## Don't forget I have another mod

Tired of just getting credits? Want something more?

Try my other mod [ShipModded](https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded)
