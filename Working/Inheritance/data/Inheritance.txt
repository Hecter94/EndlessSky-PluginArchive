	`	You find yourself standing in front of the local impound lot on a sunny Saturday morning.  You have a hangover the size of cruiser making the veins on the sides of your head throb.  The sun is almost blinding, and you could kill for a pair of sunglasses right now, but you lost your designer shades about the same time you got your ship impounded.  You really wish you could remember what you got up to last night.`
	`	You stagger into the lobby and slump forwards onto the counter, reaching up to ring the bell on the desk.  The clerk standing a foot away from you on the other side of the counter clears his throat and greets you in an annoyed tone.`

	`	"Ok..."  He spends a minute typing into his terminal before picking up a pda from next to him and handing it to you.`
	`	"You can view your bill and pay it here.  Leave the pad on the counter when you're done."  You take the pad and scroll through the charges.  Apparently you parked the vehicle rather crudely in someone's corn field and did some damage to their crop.  There are charges here for trespassing, illegal parking, and destruction of property adding up to almost half a million credits.  That's one hell of an expensive Friday night, but it wouldn't be the first time.`
	`	"You pay the charges and place the pad back on the counter.  The clerk takes it and types for a few minutes.  You're starting to wonder why it's taking so long when the attendant turns back to you.  "Ok, so your ship is at the Luna imound lot.  I went ahead and had it released for you.  You should be able to intercept it in orbit.  Have a nice day."`

			`	It's a sunny day today by the spaceport.  The sun gleams off of the various metalic surfaces of the small rural port and lights up the dingy concrete of the outdoor terminal.  It's time to find out what this whole thing is all about.`

There's a seriously shady looking set of lockers off to the far side of the port, and on the other side is the parking terminal and trade.. tent.  Yup, there sure is no-place like home.  Sure enough, a couple of children are playing with empty glass bottles in front of the parking terminal while a couple that one would assume were their parents fight over a bright red frozen confection to the side of the trade booths, which happen to be empty.`

			`	"My anus is clean! My anus is cleeeeeeaaaaaan!" The woman can be heard yelling until her voice trails off into the distance.  The two children who had been playing with glass suddenly stop and turn to stare at their parents as they run off without them.  The little boy and girl both turn to you and look up with sad looks on their faces.  You put your hands up defensively and back away.`

There's visible water damage along the outside of the two story complex causing the cheap, dirt-covered plaster to swell and crack.  A noticeable number of wooden shingles are missing from the roof, and the ones that are present are discolored from mold.  You make your way up to your apartment on the second story and press your thumb to the pad.  It beeps angrily at you and indicates that it isn't able to read your thumb.  You wipe the reader with the sleave of your shirt and try it again, this time successfully.`
			`	It takes your eyes a moment to adjust to the dark inside of your apartment.  When they do, you can see that it's just the way you left it.  Althrough if anyone else were to see it they might assume that there had been a break-in.  There are clothes strewn throughout the studio; on the floor and draped over the furniture.

Something about aliens with pointy ears and a sentient black hole or somesuch.  It doesn't take long before you're asleep on the couch.`

			`	You grab the photo off of the fridge and slouch to the ground, leaned up against your fridge.  Everything is spinning except for the photo in your hand.  But the more you stare at it, the more strange it seems to you.  Your heart quickens as your mind races to associate the image in front of you with your memories.  Any at all but they just slip away.  And the more you fight to remember the darker the room becomes until there's nothing but black.`

You duck into some nearby trees and make your way closer to the sounds of the fighting.  When you finally near the clearing towards your house, your heart skips a beat in your chest.`
			`	Half of the barn is just gone, as if it had been hit by a tornado, and the house is completely engulfed in flames.  But what makes you stop in your tracks are the two alien creatures fighting each other with giant weapons.  One of them appears to be a bipedal bird-like creature.  It's encased in what looks like some sort of bio-organic suit.  It's covered in intricate patterns and bright shades of green and blue.  It's holding what looks like a giant staff in it's hands with a golden pod-shaped weapon on the end that is currently directing a brilliant beam of light towards the other alien.  The other alien looks to be reptillian, and is covered in a sleek suit of chrome-colored mesh.  It dives out of the way of the beam and returns fire with a rifle type of weapon.  The weapon flashes and bright red pulses of energy fly out the barrel and towards the bird.  The bird-creature leaps out of the way but the concussive force of the blast sends it flying off corse.  It's weapon is launched away from it as it land on it's side in a ditch.  The staff clatters to the ground about ten feet from the edge of the clearing where you're hiding.  Seeing that his foe is down and unarmed, the reptillian creature charges accross the clearing towards it's opponent.`

The bird tries to scrambles backwards away from the reptile, but the monster just blasts the bird in the face, decapitating it instantly.`
			`	Suddenly the scene before you starts to flicker, and then it disappears entirely.  The hologram vanishes to reveal the front of an old abandoned factory.  You don't have any time to question it before everything fades to black again.  You wake up in your bed in your apartment.  Apparently it was just a dream.`

You lift it just as the reptile notices you and turns to aim his weapon at you.  You press your thumb on the indent and a brilliant beam of white shoots out of the staff.  It hits the reptile in the chest and it screeches in pain before collapsing to the ground.  A plume of smoke start to rise from the beast's corpse.`
