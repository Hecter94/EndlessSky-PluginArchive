	`Out of nowhere, a Marauder Fury appears, vaporizes your ship with stolen Drak weaponry, and vanishes without a trace. Unfortunately, you are no longer around to remark on its disappearance, as you have been vaporized along with the rest of your ship.`

	`Marauding Max himself appears as you land. "You really shouldn't be carrying that stuff around here," he tells you, "I mean, really. So really, in fact, that I'm afraid I'm going to have to execute you terminally." While you're still trying to process the grammar of the previous sentence, Marauding Max pulls a rocket launcher out of his pocket and blasts you to smithereens, as well as producing a noticeable dent in your starship hull.`

	attributes "gas giant" "core"

	description `This gas giant appears at first glance completely ordinary, but upon closer inspection it is protected by an impressive array of defensive weaponry. Upon entering its atmosphere, you are met with the sight of a vast floating metropolis, held aloft by a constant expediture of electricity and xenon gas.`
	description `	Surprisngly, the air is breatheable here, although it makes you a little lightheaded. The locals, who exude an aura of bravado and have a very strange attitude toward physical violence, seem completely unaffected by the thin air.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here dominates the floating city: almost everywhere you go you see pads filled with a wide variety of ships, some completely alien. Most, however, are heavily armed human warships that seem to have undergone significant after-market modifications. Many pads butt right up against other structures or are suspended precariously between them, but this doesn't appear to faze the pilots of the vessels they bear, who you regularly see doing maintenance work without even a safety harness.`
