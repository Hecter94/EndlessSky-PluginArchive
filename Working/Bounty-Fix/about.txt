This plugin makes Pirates/Marauders that are subject of Bounty Hunting missions be properly seen as enemies by Militia/Navy/Deep Security/Merchants and other forces that should dislike Marauders/Pirates. In other words, militia will no longer "pick their noses" watching as pirates plunder your merchant fleet in their system, just because said pirates have a bounty on their head that you want to collect.
