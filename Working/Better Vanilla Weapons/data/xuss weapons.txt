	description "Xuss has produced this upgraded Particle cannon after years of development. It utilises advanced electromagnetic field technology used in Korath fusion reactors to dramatically increase the strength of the accelerating field of a standard Particle cannon. This allows for a much higher mass of particles per shot and a slightly increased velocity. The individual projectiles carry higher momentum and deal vastly increased damage. It generates considerably more heat as a result."
