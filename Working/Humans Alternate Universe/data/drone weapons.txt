	description `A small, efficient beam used primarily for cutting into rocks. It uses its electromagnetic properties to "pull" useful metals, like iron, out from the useless other materials asteroids are comprised of. This electromagnetic "pulling" is strong enough to tug small spacecraft around, and is dense enough to interfere with the electronic components of said craft."
