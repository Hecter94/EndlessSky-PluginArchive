## The Lore of the Nomads

# About the region of space

The nomads come from an object called a globular cluster. Globular clusters are clusters of stars circulating around the 
milkyway in a relative short distance. Because of their structure, stars inside a globular cluster move much faster than the 
average star inside the milkyway. Globular clusters also circulate in the region where scientists expect the most dark matter. 
From this point on I will take some creative freedom and "invent" some facts, because we all know that just realism is boring.
Fact 1: Because of the high amount of dark matter there, a lot of gravitational storms are appearing in the outer regions of the 
cluster. Also gravitational forces are so strong that a constant drain is applied to all ships shields.
Fact 2: Around the center, gravity is more stable which results in only having a shield drain but no storms. The center of the 
cluster is a small nebula, which some cool envoiremental effects.

# About the nomads

The nomads came to live in one of the most unfriendly regions of the galaxy. Not only that but their home planet also has a lack 
of water, which limited their expansion over this one planet very quickly.
Now, the nomads are their name. Opposing what other species progression look like, they never settled down anywhere. They 
traveled from oasis to oasis. When they came to one oasis they used all the resources there exessively and went to the next one 
as soon as the resources got depleted. Now this sounds horrible to nature, but it actually is not. The nomads are experts in 
creating their routes so that the resources of one oasis will be fully replenished when they come back to it and this system 
worked for a long time, during this time no real technological advancement was there, because everything worked fine. But at 
some point, nobody really knows why anymore, their population started increasing. Not fast but slowly. First the nomads noticed 
nothing, but then resources become less on their usual travel routes and continued dropping. The nomads reacted to this problem 
by building structures on an oasis that would increase the resource output but also increase the rate at which the resources got 
replenished. The first wave of technological advancements begun. The nomads managed to hold a balance between increased 
population and advancing technology for about two millennia. At some point the population stabilised again and technological 
advancement stopped. There were a total of three of these waves and everything worked out fine, but when the fourth wave came 
the planets resources were maxed out. There was no way to increase the output. There was only one logical solution: Space 
travel. The nomads begun searching for inhabitable systems and found one. They colonized it and made it a waypoint on their 
routes. Now this is a very rough compression of how long it took the nomads to be able to space travel, the gravitational storms 
where a huge barrier and in fact they were on the tech level of the remnant when there first ships left their home system. In 
the fith wave they colonized two more planets.
--> Current state is about two millennia after the fith wave.

# Biology of the nomads

The nomads are snakes. Their size is a meter long and 10 centimeters in radius. They do not need much water and have a high heat 
tolerance.
