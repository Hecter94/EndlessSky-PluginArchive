			`As soon as you enter the system, you get hailed by a station. You accept the incomming message. A Quarg appears on your screen. He looks a bit irritated. "A human, that is not something we had expected to happen soon. But you shall recieve the same the warning as anybody else: If you go through this wormhole you will enter a region of space that is highly dangerous, if your ships shield generation is not at least five percent of your shield capacity, you will fly without shields most of the time. Additionaly some pretty strong gravitational storms are happening in this region that will deal some serious damage to your ship. If you still want to go, you should search for a species called the nomads that live in the live on outer regions of this space that we call the Edge of the Galaxy." Without waiting for your response the transmission gets closed. And you get the feeling that you should better be prepared before entering this wormhole.`

			`After travelling through this very dangerous region of space for some time, you are quite surprised to find a civilization here. The members of this species look like snakes, but they have four arm like extremities on the upper half of their body. One of them approaches you. It gestures you to follow it.`
			choice
				"[follow]"
					goto follow
				"[be sceptic]"
			`    You try to emphasize that you would rather stay next to your ship. At first your gestures seem to confuse it, but then it signals another of their kind to get something. The other one goes away, only to come back with some sort of headset that the first one takes on its head.`

			`    You follow it to a small building at the side of the spaceport. It signals you to stay outside. After a moment it comes back outside with some sort of headset on its head.`
			label talk
			`    Suddenly it begins to talk in your language. "Welcome human, this must be confusing to you. But this is also confusing to us. When we last chacked 100 years ago, humans were far away from being able to reach this place."`
			choice
				`"I am different."`
				`"Most humans still are."`
			`    "So you got access to some things most humans have not, interesting", it pauses, "Ah, I was drifting away, let me introdce ourselves. We are the nomads, we settle some planets in this region of space. The reason why we have access to your language is that we every century send out an expedition all over the galaxy to gather the newest informations. Although it has not been long ago, that the wormhole you traveled through did not exist. Most official places will have translation tools to talk to you so feel free to travel around here. Just be careful with the alien space life in the core of this cluster, it is more dangerous than you might think. Under no circumstances kill one of these. Well, that is about it. We wont sell you any of our stuff, for various reasons, one of them being our contract with the Quarg who you probbaly met by now." It says goodbye and leaves you alone again.`
