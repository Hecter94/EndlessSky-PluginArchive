			`It does not take long for Danforth's team to locate the Alpha base, buried deep underground in a network of limestone caves. You and Danforth hover your ships above the site to catch anyone who tries to take off and escape. Danforth keeps you updated on the progress of the troops. "Breached the perimeter. Dealing with some booby traps. Explosives, poison gas. Nasty stuff. No sign of inhabitants, but they were here recently. Place looks cleaned out. Extensive base. Hangars, labs, supply rooms. Probably took them a century to build."`
			`	His troops spend a while exploring the base and eventually conclude that the Alphas packed up and left soon after you destroyed the carrier. Once the place has been thoroughly explored and they are sure there are no more clues to be found, Danforth tells them, "Okay, blow the place. No sense in leaving them a base to return to."`
			choice
				`	"So this was all for nothing?"`
				`	"I wish we had been able to catch them."`
			`	"Don't feel so bad," says Danforth. "At least you took out their Carrier. If you had come for me without engaging them, chances are they would still have figured their cover was blown and fled. And now they're on the run, which is going to limit their ability to make mischief."`
			`	Danforth's ship collects his troops and takes off. A few seconds later he hails you. "Captain, we have incoming ships from the far side of the planet," he says. "My ship is no match for them. Let's get out of here." It looks like this world is not completely uninhabited, after all...`
