Du'Annoe Empire Notes:
	drones, no fighters, small warships/cargo ships -> Super-Capital Vessels.
	Few Weapons per ship, heavy usage of drones.
	lots of shielding, not much hull.
	built in hull repair and shield capacity(no shield regen)
	builds few, titanic stations, inhabits few worlds, controls many
	despises most of humanity(likes the republic navy, wanderers, and unfettered hai, despises korath and drak, pug and PTG neutral)
	uses energy weapons, mostly beams, and tracking energy projectiles that are slow but strong
	drones come armed with forward facing lancer beams
	heavy warships bad a turning
	ships are plunderable for outfits and vessels
	Hellscape planets, utopian stations.

Other Notes:
Mineable ships that give random useable outfits you cannot buy
rare-earth metal asteroids
abandoned space stations that take LOADS of damage but give very valuable things
comets that give ice or life stuffs that sell for high values
new commodities
long ranged wormhole to SMC
NEED BACKGROUND FOR MAP
TartShipyards Artifial world orbits a black-hole which gives off enough light to be the star; other orbital bodies: Main Shipyards(The Grand Forge), random desolate worlds with no atmosphere(landable mining colonies).
Du'Annoe Empire Raids SDL, ZR, TS, and Space Monsters
Space Monster inhabited star system
Alien Menace production facility (star-base with planetoid belt)

Ship Style Definitions:

references are the Caldari from EVE Online mixed with Hiigaran ships from Homeworld 2 (Tartaros Shipyards):

    Boxy. (These ships are function>form, they trade most of their looks for weapons, armor, capacity, and general toughness.)
    Angular (Where there's a transition between sizes of areas there's a slope, a hard angular sharp-looking slope. No curves here.)
    Bulky. (Their ships aren't just big, they're fat; very few thin/spindly bits exist in their ships. Think UNSC vs Covenant, flying boxes with guns vs organic curves.)
    Armored. (Ships use very little windows, as they are mostly armor. having been cut off from the rest of humanity for so long they missed out on shields and efficient energy weapons, they're missile and cannon heavy.)
    Huge (What constitutes a fighter for them fits the bill for a frigate to the Republic/Syndicate/Deep.)
    Dull (Little ID color, enough to tell factions apart and make them look lively, but not much more.)
    Antenna-city (if there's room for it, multiple sizes of antenna and radar dishes on the front and sides of the ships within reason; asymmetry is okay)
    Piles-and-piles-of-rivets (overall visuals would be completely covered in panels of riveted on metal, a patchwork of steel-diamond plate, grates, and hard-points for turrets)
    Dark (The metals used in these ships is old, worn, darkened by atmospheric entry/exit, or made of stealth materials. none of their ships announce their locations much by reducing overall brightness of the metal. the brightest they get is unpainted raw steel grey.)
    Outfits follow these same rules

A second set of ships I'd need are very different but on the same scale, references would be the Kadeshi from Homeworld 1 and the Vulcan ships from Star Trek (Du'Annoe Empire):

    Sleek (These Ships would slip right through water if dropped into it; they've got very round shapes with only a few hard angles around the engines with few protrusions of the hull(excluding pylons for more hull bits/engines).)
    Colorful (They'd be full of color and life, though not so much that the swizzle kills the effect.)
    Organo-Metalic (The ships shouldn't have much in the way of welds or rivets or even hard size transitions, everything should be smooth unless it's an engine, turret location, or fighter/drone dock.)
    Bright (Hull colors that aren't swizzle colors should be brighter greys, a bit brighter than the vanilla ships, but not so bright as to make lighting impossible to do.)
    Variety is the spice of Life (Their ships come in many sizes, from tiny drones that might be a few meters across and long, to vessels that make the Worldship look small.)
    Long-ship-is-loooooong (on rare occasion these ships are wider than they are long; the average vessel in this style is aspect ratio 3:1.)
    Space Apple (No windows anywhere on these ships.)
    Outfits follow these same rules

A third set would be animated living vessels; space monsters if you will. go wild with these but there are a few stipulations:

    Swizzleless
    Animated(at least 10 frames showing some form of organic movement, this might be the hardest part of the whole set honestly.)
    Challenge: create a sort of "Space flock" with a space-monster that carries up to 40(hard limit in game code) drones that are also organic and animated.
    subset: Living Machine ships; references would be the SoTS Silicoids.(Wiki photo links are dead, sorry) above stipulations apply.
    outfits can be left blank or given icons if desired.

A fourth, human set, would be the cargo ships; the references would be BattleStar Galactica Freighters (Plutus Trade Guild):

	No Swizzel, so have fun with the colors on the cargo containers.
	Hull would be similar to the Tartaros Shipyards Style but slightly birghter metals, and with much more area open for cargo containers.
	Actual ship scale would be different; a small cargo ship for the PTG is a huge cargo ship for the republic, though they're not quite wide hull-ed, more long than anything else.
	Cargo containers can be oriented any way you wish.

a fifth set is just abandoned or wrecked ships, ranging from drones to the occasional battleship or dreadnought; artistic freedom is granted here, just imagine they'e quite old version of existing ships or even predecessors to those ship designs. along with those I need unique outfits/weapons that cannot be bought but can be salvaged from these wrecks(turrets, guns, thrusters, reactors, CQC weapons, etc). Also I do need at least 4 abandoned space stations with 4 unique outfits to find(a cooling outfit, a reactor, a hull repair outfit, and an AI core)


the sixth set would be the SDL ships, references would be the Stilleto Stealth Ship, Zumwalt class destroyer, B2 Bomber, and the F117 Nighthawk(Spatial Dynamics LTD).

	Low Profile
	Radar-absorbant, lower numbers of round edges and open glass, no antennas or radar dishes.
	Less protuding guns, sunken turret bases
	low profile engines
	Smaller than Tartaros Shipyards Ships but bigger than republic medium warships

The Seventh set would be pirate vessels, ships hap-hazardly thrown together from civilian ships and captured military vessels, sometimes even asteroids:

	intimidating
	broken ships welded together or even just stolen military ships
	no drones
	gun pods/turret outriggers common
	any shape you desire.
