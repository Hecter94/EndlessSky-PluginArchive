	"cooling" 12.5
	description "The Spectral Core is a little-understood form of fusion reactor that fuses photons inside a contained pocket-universe with different physics into a KugelBlitz and then extracts the raw energy produced by it for usage, with no heat output. this effectively makes the Spectral Core a 100% efficient power generator. It is quite heafty though, and it may just be more worth it to sell it, someone will probably pay a LOT of money to own this lost technology."

	"cooling" 600
	description "The Particle Beam Heat Sink uses heavy particle beams to cool it's containment box to a few picokelvin above absolute zero (10^-12K). Being near absolute zero allows you a lot more wiggle room with heat than most ships have, though you'll pay for it in outfit space and energy generation."

	"jump speed" 99999999999999
	"jump drive" 1
	description "The Janus Labs Warp Drive creates a bubble of space around a ship with a compressed forward region and an expanded backward region, the effect is FTL to the eye while the ship has never actually moved within the bubble."
	description "The original version had issues with radioactive particle build-up in the front of the bubble but recent advances have removed that, making radiation-bursts no longer an issue allowing ships to drop in and out of warp anywhere in a system safely."
	description "Warp Drives use a lot of energy and produce a significant heat load, the main benifit they provide is unmatched jump speed, allowing ships to move incredibly fast while activating the drive system. Unfortunately, they're also quite large."
