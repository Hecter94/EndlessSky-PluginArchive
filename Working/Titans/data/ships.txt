	description "An unkown design found on a secluded world with no atmosphere, partially burried under centuries of mud and ash; the technology is ancient but massively more advanced than current Quarg tech. The ship is over 650m long and boasts a gargantuan drone storage along with huge weapon capacity and immense defenses. This is a vessel designed for a war that had escalated for hundreds of thousands of centuries at least."
	description "If you somehow come into ownership of the required money to meet the purchase price of this easter egg ship you're either cheating or have found some form of exploit. Well done, have fun wrecking Drak ships (and your frame rate) with ease."

	description "The Tartaros Shipyards Damocles Battlecarrier is a fusion of a battleship and carrier, the end result is a powerful ship that can deploy drones or deal massive damage at a moment's notice, and can operate largely without carrier support. The Damocles comes equiped with a under-slung pylon docking ring that allows it to carry one Battle Rider class ship, or a fighter if desired as the drone bay is not pressurized at all or set up to be pressurized for crew."
	description "The size of this vessel is abosultely monolithic, most republic capital ships could park in it's hangar bay quite easily. Keep in mind that this vessel will never turn at any acceptable rate, so don't wait up for it to jump with you."
