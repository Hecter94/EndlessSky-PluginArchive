planet "Wormhole SMC"

planet Plexippus
	landscape land/plex
	description `Plexippus is a deceptive world; while it is green and filled with life its not earth like. Plexippus is cold enough to be considered sub-arctic; any brown you see is snow or ice with brown algae in it that use the intense solar radiation to thrive. Its highly suggeted to wear sunscreen and thick sun shades to prevent occular damage or sun burns. The population centers on Plexippus are all short buildings with massively over-powered heating units which puts electricity at a premium year round.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is a heated slab of concrete that is strangely still frigid to the touch despite the heating coils running through it. The area surrounding the spaceport is over-run with strange evergreens that have razor sharp leaves and no visible cones. The landing pad is completely scorched by engine exhaust and a few ground crew members appear to be working to scrub it clean with little success.`

planet Nemos
	landscape land/Nemos
	description `Nemos is a gas giant who's upper atmosphere consists of near breathable levels of oxygen and nitrogen; there are however traces of ionized krypton and xenon gas in the lower atmosphere that make the world's atmosphere glow an eerie blue between dusk and dawn bright enough to shine through the immense cloud banks. All lightning on this world is a vibrant white-blue and its become a tourist stop for civilian cruise liners to watch the lightning on the darkside of the planet.`
	description `Beneath the towering clouds lies an ocean that is a mix of water so salty that its opaque, mercury, and iodine. Prisoner based slave labor is utilized to gather iodine for use off world but the gathering process has very high mortality rates.`
	spaceport `The only part of this world that is fully habitable is the upper atmosphere where the main population centers are based on huge flying cities, they're powered by centuries old fission reactors and lumber about the skies with massive propellers. To land you have to tune to a radio frequency with real-time approximate co-ordinates of the city and once you arrive the task of landing is up to you.`

planet Kalfas
	landscape land/kalfas
	description `Kalfas is a very rare world, a moon consisting of 53.33% elemental silicon. surface temperatures range from 95° C in the sun to 5° C in the shade; atmospheric pressure is nearly non-existant and all work done on the moon is done inside EVA suits equiped with thick rubber padding on the outside to prevent the workers from being cut by the sharp silicon crystals. The main export of this world is circuit-board-grade silicon.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Kalfas consists of a set of landing platforms big enough for a shuttle or light warship at most, and airlocks. Directly inside the airlocks are merchants selling EVA suits at "discount" prices, followed by merchants trying to offload hundreds of tons of silicon ore to anything that moves.`
