			`When you enter Stormhold's spaceport, you can hardly believe your eyes. A Republic Cruiser is parked right in front of you, and it has a pirate logo spray-painted on the hull. You move closer to take a look. A very authoritarian-looking woman is currently scaring up a group of technicians who are taking a break. She notices you admiring her ship and strolls over to you.`
			`"Isn't that a beauty?" she asks.`

			`		"You don't look like a member of the Navy. And if you were, you wouldn't be welcome here. So, how?" you ask.`
			`She smiles. "I have a contact in the Navy administration on Geminus. It cost me 500,000 credits just to have the one license forged. It is equipped with a secret service seal so that no patrol or shipyard will inspect it more closely. And now I'm saving up to have my contact forge the other three licenses.`
			`"If you are interested, I would perhaps arrange a meeting with my contact. Let's say for a small fee of 50,000 credits?"`

			`Ok, great. I'll arrange a meeting with my contact on Geminus. He is risking a lot with a stranger, so keep the credits ready for him. "`
