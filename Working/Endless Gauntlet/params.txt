# "size" The number of systems in the gauntlet.	
# "checkpoints" The number of planets per ten systems to refuel/restock ammo
# "min" and "max":
# Every ten systems, place a checkpoint in a random system between min and max.
# ex. first checkpoint is between 3 and 6, second is between 13 and 16, etc.
# "healthpack frequency" Frequency of the healthpack ships in milliseconds.

# "size":	
# Difficulty of the individual fleets using weights below.
# ex. "size" 10, T1 = .5, Interceptor = .5
# the size of the fleet could be 10/(.5 + .5) = 10 T1 interceptors
# "variance" Random variance for "size"

# Weights used when selecting a ship. A ship's "cost" is category + tier.
# A zero weight will exclude all ships that match.
# ex. "Heavy Warship" 0.0 means no Heavy Warships of any tier will spawn.
# ex. 5 0.0 means no "Tier 5" ships of any category will spawn.
