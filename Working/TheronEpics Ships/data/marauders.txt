	description "Though hard to acquire and expensive to modify, this Corvette is quite the favorite among many pirates. Going beyond the unmodified version of the already powerful Corvette, the shield matrix has been boosted with more emitters. And, its hull has been reinforced some, perhaps to help against nervousness flying a ship that'd get punched through like a piece of paper if it were hit by an asteroid while shields were down. Room has been made for an additional turret mount, as well."

	description `The not-so-popular Scout has become neglected over the years since Humanity has expanded, in favor of the newer and more advanced Arrow and Bounder. But someone out there has greatly changed this ship, making it versatile in pirate fleets. Its shield matrix has been standardized, its engine mounts made more spacious, and its side tanks have gun ports mounted on them.`
	description `It's used to scout ahead of main pirate fleets for juicy cargo, and can escape easily if it encounters a system with defenses that it can't go against. Its generous potential cargo space and bunks can be used for smugglers too.`
