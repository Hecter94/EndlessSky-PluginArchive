	description `The Amur bears a striking resemblance to the Osprey... until you get up close. It's 25% bigger, and like the bird of prey it's named for, its default outfit set is favored towards a hit-and-run tactic, hitting with high firepower before running to recharge if it hasn't won yet.`

	description `In an attempt to create an alternative to the ever-famous Betelgeuse Shuttle, a lesser-known competitor known as Gryphon put together the Haumea in its early days. Able to be a low-level asteroid mining ship, a passenger transport, or a small cargo haul, the Haumea is a decent third-party choice for starting captains.`
	description `While its weapon capacity is about as weak as a regular shuttle, it has three possible places to put guns. All three are almost never used at the same time, with the third mount being only for those who like symmetry, but two blasters are better than one.`

	description `While not as agile by Remnant standards as other ships, the Auklet is built to survive. The ship itself has a high degree of autonomous control over its advanced shield matrix, which lets it reduce the impact of any strike against it. This prevents it from being affected as much by each special effect the Remnant have encountered, like ion damage and slowing effects, but notably it is highly resistant to the Korath's pushing and pulling weapons.`
	description `	Often, the Remnant convert a portion of one's cargo space to better-arm this ship.`
	description `Its ramscoop "gills" are emphasized more than other Remnant ships as well, letting it refuel more quickly.
#	description `While not as agile by Remnant standards as their other ships, the Auklet has high survivability through its advanced shield regenerative capabilities. The ship has a high level of autonomous control over its own shields, allowing it to distort to turn normally direct shots into glancing hits. This reduces shield damage taken, and reduces the effectivity of other weapon effects such as the Korath's pushing and pulling weapons which would otherwise hinder its escape.`

	description "The Fulmar is the smallest independent battle-capable ship both still made and updated by the Remnant. Its shield technology is also impressive, for a ship of its size."
	description "Its role in combat is similar to that of the Petrel fighter, using mid-range weaponry to minimize loss of life by being able to stay at a safe distance."
