There was no response to your hails and your sensors detected no life signs as you maneuvered your ship for docking; in fact the only thing you detected was a faint power source near the station core. Your sensors read only minimal atmosphere on the station so a suit will be necessary if you want to explore and see if you can find that power source.`

			`	You take a few minutes to suit up, grab a portable scanner pack, and then make your way out the airlock into the station. All of the lighting is out, even the emergency backups, so you turn on your helmet lights. Checking the readings from your scan-pack you start to make your way deeper into the station heading towards the power source. Finally after more than half an hour of making your way through empty, abandoned corridors your scan-pack indicates the power source is located just ahead. You make your way through a hatch into a large compartment almost completely filled with computer systems, in one corner you see a large bank of backup batteries which must be the power source you detected. A few of the indicator lights on some of the computers are lit but most of them are dark, it seems there is not enough power available to run the systems.`

The conduit runs through a few corridors and around a few corners getting ever closer the the station core until it enters another large compartment.

Upon closer examination there are a few parts missing or broken but it looks like it could be repaired if you had some spare parts.`

You install the start-up capacitor from the reactor you cannibalized and initiate the start-up sequence; the fusion plant hums to life and the lighting in the compartment and in the corridor comes on. You make your way to the computer room and find that everything has powered back up. As soon as you step into the room a feminine voice addresses you, "Are you the one who repaired the auxiliary power plant?"`
			`	"Yes, my name is <first> <last>."`
			`	"Thank you for that, my backup batteries were nearly depleted. My name is Ereshkigal, I run Enki Station."`
			`	"Who built Enki Station?"`
			`	"Enki Station was built by Nergal Heavy Industries, it is an advanced, AI controlled shipyard and outfitter. All manufacturing processes take place on the station and are run entirely by the station AI, me.  Any resources necessary for manufacturing can be retrieved by pre-programmed robotic drones without human intervention. There is a complete R&D section capable of reverse engineering most technology, again run by me. According to my logs Nergal Heavy Industries had just completed the station when a raid by an unidentified alien species wiped out the caretaker crew that was present. The aliens then removed several pieces of equipment from both the shipyard and the outfitter and then proceeded to shut down both power plants and either remove or damage components in an effort to prevent reactivation. Now that I have access to the interstellar data net again, I can find no current records pertaining to Nergal Heavy Industries, it seems they no longer exist but I will continue to search."`
			`	"Wait, both power plants? You mean there is another one?"`
			`	"Yes, the power plant you repaired is the auxiliary backup plant. It provides enough power to keep the AI running and a minimum of manufacturing capability, basically enough to manufacture replacement parts for the main reactor in the event of an emergency. The battery power I was reduced to before you repaired the auxiliary plant was insufficient to manufacture anything which prevented me from effecting repairs; also I am missing several pieces of equipment that will have to be replaced before I am able to begin any repairs or run the shipyard or outfitter. I have found and gained access to what appears to be the last bank account that Nergal Heavy Industries had, there is just enough of a credit balance left to purchase the replacement equipment I will need and provide you with an appropriate reward for my reactivation. A freighter will be necessary to carry that volume of equipment, it will require an escort. Visit <destination> when you are able to provide an escort for the freighter."`
