	"cooling inefficiency" 0.5

	"outfit space" 7
	"cargo space" -10
	description "The smaller outfit expansion allows you to sacrifice that last corner of cargo space in order to perhaps make room for one more outfit, in those situations where you need just seven more tons to install that last system."
	description "	Unfortunately, rearranging the interior of your ship in such a fundamental way tends to interfere with its cooling systems."

	"fuel consumption" 0.005
	description "A small fuel pod that is placed outside of the hull. Unfortunately hyperspace fuel tends to slowly leak into space from these modules. Attempts to combat this led to drastic increases in mass and cost and were deemed unmarketable. Captains are cautioned to always install ramscoops alongside external pods."
	description "While safety mechanisms ensure the pod will never detonate in flight, a small amount of hull integrity and a handful of heat vents must be sacrificed to install the pod."

	description "For the captain who needs more outfit space and does not particularily care about their ships mass, heat dissipation, or hull integrity. One other benefit is that additional shield emitters come built into the hull, though they tend to generate large amounts of heat due to their janky installation."
	description "The Pillager Bolt-on Cockpit is a used Heavy Shuttle renovated and modified to be bolted onto a ship. Security systems installed make it so that it has less outfit space than the Heavy Shuttle itself. Such an invasive modification requires constant maintenance to stay operable."

	description "While this war machine is slightly too big to fit through most ship portholes, it is more than capable of making it's own holes in ships with it's drilling equipment and advanced anti-personnel weaponry.  It's heavy armor and internal air supply make most ship boarding countermeasures useless.  Unfortunatly it requires contstant maintenance to run without faults due to the experimental nature of some of it's components."
	description "Originally designed by Lovelace as a new piece of advanced boarding tech for the Navy, it was quickly abandoned in the prototype stage as far too costly to produce and maintain for far too little benefit. This problem was less important to blood thirsty pirate warlords, who saw a massive intimidating mech-suit as worth all the costs involved."
