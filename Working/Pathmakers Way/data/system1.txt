	description `Artedakk was the first world the Pathmakers colonized in the Milky Way. The Travelers have built one small settlement on the surface, with nothing but wooden buildings and gravel roads. It is but a small speck in the sprawling desert, and is only protected from the fierce sandstorms by a modified shield generator. Beneath the surface is where they do their real work, crafting and modifying tech from humans and other aliens. Entire cities live beneath the ground, analyzing data from each planet and preparing for their next voyage.`

	spaceport `At first glance, the place where you park your ship appears to be a circle of stones just large enough for your vessel. When you touchdown, mechanical parts are eard stirring, and your ship is taken below the ground. After a few minutes, you arrive deep in the earth, surrounded by sophisticated alien technology. A group of insect-like aliens, about three-fourths the size of an average human, rush to inspect your ship, taking inventory of its outfits and personnel. Through an archway, you find large doors are built into tunnels that extend as far as the eye can see, making up a large system of "houses". Signs hang above some of them, apparently marking stores. Small groups of the Pathmakers are moving about everywhere, and every single one of them turn to observe you with curiosity. Many of them tinker with mechanical gadgets as they walk along, with some even bumping into each other.`
