	description `Keinnu was originally an extremely cold planet, floating between Hai and Wanderer space. One mechanical star and many terraforming attempts later, it flourished with life, a suitable outpost for the Pathmakers. However, some experimental fertilizer leaked from a silo, covering practically the entire planet in plant life. It is currently regrowing any trees the Pathmakers attempt to remove, and so any settlements are located on top of the trees.`

	spaceport `The parking spot for your ship is a small wooden platform reinforced with a Pathmaker alloy. It is connected to many other structures with rope bridges. Leaves fall from the trees surrounding the settlement, but the fertilizer has enhanced them so much that each leaf is almost immediately replaced. Shopkeepers rush to clear out any seed pods that float through the door, trying to stop an infestation before it starts, and one restaurant has a tree growing through the roof. Besides the small, insectoid Pathmakers, there are some Wanderers here, obviously ambassadors invited here to negotiate.`
