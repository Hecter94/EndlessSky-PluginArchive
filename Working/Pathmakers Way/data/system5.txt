	description `Destral was created by the Pathmakers a few years ago to bridge the gap between the Deep and the Far North. Using one their new mechanical stars, they created a wormhole, as well as three new systems. This planet was made to serve as a sort of outpost, monitoring one of the stars, which has gone dark, unstable with the amount of energy it is producing. Terraforming techniques from other aliens allowed vegetation to flourish here, as well as create the breathable atmosphere. Like all Pathmaker worlds, the surface is relatively unchanged, save a few small signal towers and mining facilities.`

	spaceport `The spaceport here, somewhat surprisingly, does not go underground. Instead, a signal tower directed you to a small spot hidden among the thick canopy. Here, under the trees, a few small wooden buildings have been constructed. Standing out among them is a large metal building, with antenna sticking out, possibly monitoring the activity of the darkened mechanical star. Many Pathmakers are walking around, carrying materials to the ships, which are prepped to repair the damaged mechstar if need be. The only other thing that stands out is a tavern, selling strange alien foods, including some you recognize from the Hai and Quarg planets.`
