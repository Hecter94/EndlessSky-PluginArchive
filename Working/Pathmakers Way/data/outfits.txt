	"shield generation" 4.5
	"heat generation" 10
	"energy generation" -1.6
	description "This modified shield generator aimed to mix the low size and powerful shield generation of the Korath and Quantum shield generators. The design does not exactly meet either of these requirements and draws some energy and heat from the ship, but it is still reliable and is used to this day. Enhanced versions of this shield generator create a complex matrices that keep their mechanical stars stable."

	"ramscoop" 2	
	description "After extensive study of both alien and human generators, the Travelers came up with their own source of power. They managed to lower the size requirements of the Korath Tek'nel Generator's components, as well as adding some of their own, at the cost of more heat and, of course, a greater expense to make. It also radiates with the energy it produces, which, for some reason, drains the shields. Strangely, it also manages to drain plasma from the surrounding area as well, a feature the Pathmakers have integrated into their Plasma Siphon. Enhanced versions of these generators are installed in their mechanical stars, and use its plasma draining feature for more stability."

	description "Surprisingly, the Travelers made this from scratch. It is a relic from their homeworld, a planet none of them remember, and so no one knows its origins. Whoever made it also integrated some fuel storage, but the metal its casing is made from radiates energy that interferes with your shields, as well as makes it heavier."

	description "The Welder was originally created to repair Pathmaker creations. During an incident with the Unstable Mech Star, it was haphazardly attached to a ship as a way to quickly repair it. It has been standard to carry them around for emergencies ever since. However, they are also quite useful for warding off pirates. They deal more damage than many human weapons, as well as consume less energy, but produce an insane amount of heat in comparison."

	"ramscoop" 14
	description "The Travelers use enlarged versions of these devices to tunnel through space, warping space and time around them, but unlike Pug wormholes, can only reach a short distance. Like the jump drive, it has matter inside of it that must be kept in a state not possible in this universe. It gathers plasma from the surrounding area like a ramscoop, but gathers a larger quantity and drains energy reserves rather quickly. Some of the plasma and energy is redirected into the shields to avoid strain."

	"ramscoop" 24
	description "In an attempt to understand why one of the Mech Stars has gone dark, the Pathmakers created an Aether Siphon based on its properties. The result generates heat, shields, and plasma extremely quickly, as well as puts tremendous strain on the energy supply. Almost no one wants to buy it, and so prices have been lowered to a more agreeable amount."

	"ramscoop" 10
	description "After studying their Starmaker Reactor, the Pathmakers adapted a piece of it to gather more plasma. They used their Aether Siphon to augment it, and this is the result. While negotiations continue with the Wanderers, they hope to use these to travel through their systems and observe technology. It is built to be more stable than their other siphons by redirecting more energy through the shields. However, this also diverts more of the plasma."

	"energy generation" -2.1
	description "This strange device was found floating in space by the Pathmakers. It was found to be an AI by the curious Pathmakers, and when plugged into a ship, will use the ship to scan anything nearby. This has led to theories that it was a research device. It has been constructed to be both a jump drive and hyperdrive, but the computer inside it generates heat and uses energy."

	description "A strange crystal that was found growing in around the largest Starmaker Reactors, located in the mechanical stars. It can hold a charge equal to a small battery, but they are in short supply and expensive. This may change, however: Pathmakers are currently researching why it grows and how to replicate the effect."

	"crystal capacity" -2
	description "The discovery of this crystal was a complete accident. While testing a prototype based on the Pug Seeker, the projectiles homed in on a different experiment: the Ion Crystals. The reaction created these strange crystals, which generate a strange charge that can be used to recharge shields and other systems. However, it also radiates with heat during this process, and must be in the vicinity of an Ion Crystal."

	description "The Pathmakers are not known for their combat skills. Instead, they prefer to observe, even at the risk of their own lives. The discovery of the Korath cloaking device lead them to develop their own for this purpose. It is kept in perpetual transparency, which uses energy and generates heat, but allows the ship to claok much faster."
