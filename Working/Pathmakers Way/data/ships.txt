	description "This ship was created by the Travelers in their quest to explore the galaxy - and possibly other galaxies as well. They were initially only built to be extremely light and fast, as well as carrying passengers, hence their low strength, extreme speed and high amounts of fuel. Their encounter with the Korath made them realize they would need more protection, and they began to modify Korath technology to suit their needs. It is now capable of repelling an enemy attack before speedily flying off, making it almost uncatchable."

	description "Looking for a way to allow their ever expanding population to remain nomadic, the Travelers stumbled upon the great Korath World-Ships and were instantly enamored. They immediately set out to build their own, gathering pieces of ships from across the galaxy to create this behemoth. Currently, it is only a prototype, and they are still gathering other components for the final build. In particular, they currently wish to add the detachable cargo of the Wanderers' 'Deep River'."

	description "In their endeavour to replicate Pug technology, the Pathmakers ran a series of test ships. This was their 75th attempt, and it was deemed good enough for production. Although not as strong as a Pug Enfolta in terms of strength, it serves rather well as a transport ship. It can carry a decent amount of passengers to a destination rather quickly, and has enough armament and agility to fend off pirates. It also has the built-in generation Pug ships have, generating shields, energy and heat without any generators installed."

	description "Their exploration of this part of the galaxy complete, the Travelers are almost ready to move on. To remember it, they do what they do best: improve on the other species' technology. The Hodgepodge is the culmination of many years of work and the technology of many different races. Literally a fusion of ships, their parts welded together to create a city-ship, the Hodgepodge has a relatively weak hull, and may possibly rival the Protector in terms of ugliness."
