planet Artockk
	attributes mining
	landscape land/fog0
	description `This world is covered in extremely dense fog, and has canyons as deep as its vast oceans. Vegetation can only grow atop the peaks of the tallest mountains, or in the heat vents located deep underwater. Light towers can be seen littering many of the mountaintops, as well as a few lights blinking amid the fog. The Pathmakers use this planet as a sort of mining facility, as well as large, gentically enhanced mushroom farms beneath the surface. It is the main supplier of food to One-Eye station.`

	spaceport `The only visible sign of the spaceport from the surface is a circle of lights, deep beneath the fog. The lights lead you not to a landing pad, but to a tunnel that leads you into the earth, big enough for your ship to fit through. It leads to a large cavern, filled with scurrying Pathmakers and their drilling machines. From above, they appear to scurry like ants building a hill, creating holes and carrying things back and forth. In the tunnels, genetically enhanced mushrooms light up thousands of others, with Pathmakers grabbing a select few.`

planet "One-Eye Station"

	attributes station research

	landscape land/pathstation0
	description `This huge station, home to operation One-Eye, is dedicated to salvaging wreckage from deep within human space. Operation One-Eye is built upon a single purpose: to recover anything of what is considered value. Currently, the top priority is Pug technology left over from the war, preferrably to help develop a more stable wormhole. Its size allows it to hold a population as large as a planet. Although it is unreachable by regular human means, they still cloak their location to prevent discovery. However, whoever can find it is welcome to the many outfits they have available.`
	spaceport `The docking bay for your ship is located within a much larger one, probably used to house one of their world-ships. Before entering the elevator, you notice the insectoid Pathmakers are scurrying up and down specialized vents, apparently their preferred mode of transportation here. One thing immediately catches your notice: 4 of the 'floors' in this station are dedicated to stores and apartments for the Pathmakers, even though this is supposedly a research station. The other 7 floors are jam-packed with complex technology, with sonar scanners being the only machines you can identify. There are also workshops located here, as indicated by the maps and loud noises, but are only accessible by the chutes.`
