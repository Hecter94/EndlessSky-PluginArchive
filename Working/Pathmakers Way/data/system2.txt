	description `This mountainous world, like Artedakk, hides a large population of Travelers. Where Artedakk has factories, Odina stores the many scraps they find. Thousands of different ship parts can be found in its underground warehouses, although they are not for sale. Instead, they are shipped to Artedakk to be fused together into yet another hodgepodge creation, modified to serve the Travelers in their quest of exploration.`

	spaceport `On Artedakk, the halls of the underground city were alive with activity, filled with curious Travelers itching to peek at your ship. Here, very few come to see it, as there are few outfits that cannot be viewed in their massive storehouses. The spaceport is much like Artedakk, except there is grass growing here, and many other hangars are visible, waiting to accept freighters bringing in new scraps and parts.`
