	description `Unlike the rest of the Pathmaker worlds, Meetra's surface is covered in countless farms, and its oceans filled with fishing boats. No apparent effort has been made to conceal any of the settlements. However, there are still many underground systems, filled with the Pathmakers and their factories.`

	spaceport `Here, even the spaceport is aboveground. Other ships are lined up, each parked in the center of a circle of stones. A few restaurants surround the port, each hosting a different kind of meal, and in the distance you can see farmland dotting the landscape. However, no vendor is selling any sort of technology.`

	attributes research station
	landscape land/pathstation1
	description `This "space station" is the only Korath World-Ship the Pathmakers have managed to capture. The jump drive they used to get it out of Korath space has since been removed, as well as many of the other systems. It is mostly being studied to continue modification of their prototype "Leapyear", but some Pathmakers have taken up residence in its massive halls, observing how life would be like in such a large ship. Looting of it continues, Pathmakers scurrying to find any blueprints or special outfits left behind.`
	spaceport `To make room for a spaceport, a dozen of the Korath bunkrooms were cleared out, the walls welded into shape. A refueling station was hastily shoved into the corner, with a small corridor leading to the inside of the ship in the other corner. Signs in the Korath ship have still not been removed, and the restaurants have menus standing in front of them. Once in a while, a Pathmaker, their stomach growling, will walk into one of the stores, before realizing it's been long shut down.`
