# Arbiter mod for Endless Sky

This mod adds another civilization called "Arbiter" into the game.
To start the storyline, one has to complete the main story as well as make contact with the Quarg, Wanderers, Hai, Korath, Coalition, and has to be equipped with a jump drive. Then find a system called "Wolf" somewhear around the Free Worlds space.
When you get to the Wolf system, the story will be pretty much self-explanatory.
