planet "Range 1"
	attributes station Arbiter
	landscape land/water11-harro
	description `This is the first test range of the Arbiter. No actual testing is conducted here. There are, however, many buildings dedicated to loading freighters and preparing equipment for export. The planet itself is mostly water, with small patches of land full of rivers and ponds. The atmosphere is breathable, warm and a bit denser than on Earth. There is also much more oxygen. It is one of the most pleasurable atmospheres and planets you have encountered. If it weren't for all those exciting space adventures, you would be more than happy to settle here.`

planet "Range 2"
	attributes station Arbiter
	landscape land/sky5
	description `This range is dedicated for non-military technology testing. You can see many T-shaped aircraft cruising in the sky, and small autonomous rovers driving around. The air here is very dry and rough to breathe. Sometimes you can hear far explosions, but in a local terminal you can read that it comes from testing of mining explosives. The terminal also mentions many underground facilities that house experimental power plant designs.`

planet "Range 3"
	attributes station Arbiter
	landscape land/valley15-harro
<<<<<<< HEAD
	description `Sole purpose of this Range is development of missile defense systems. There are hangars in which you can see Freighters being loaded with an anti-missile turret that you have never seen before. You can also hear the distinct sound of missile defense being fired all over the place. Sometimes you notice a destroyed ship burning and tumbling towards the ground through the atmosphere. It is obvious that there are large-scale fights being fought around this planet. You feel like joining the fight, just for fun.`

=======
	description `This is the Range that developed the modified Freighter that the Arbiter is using to access the rest of the galaxy. You can see many huge factories full of incomplete Freighter hulls. You also notice that most of these hulls are being fitted with interiors that are completely different when compared to the human Freighter you know.`
