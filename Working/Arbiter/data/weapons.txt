	description "As the Arbiter was capturing human ships, he started to collect large amounts of anti-missile turrets that were not needed for him. He then decided that he will take all these weapons and change their properties so they will be better suited for his freighters. It is much more expensive than the base variant, but it can completely rewrite the results of a fight when used properly."
