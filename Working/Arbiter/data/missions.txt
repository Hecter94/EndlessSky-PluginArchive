			`This is truly the most creepy experience of yours. Even though the space aroud is heavily populated with human and alien ships, the station is eerily silent, only with a quiet hum of cooling fans breaking the silence. There are no humans or other aliens, not even your ship sensors can detect any sort of lifeform.`
			`	There are many computer screens attached to every wall, some pitch black, some flashing what seems to be random strings of unknown characters, but sometimes you can recognize letters of your own alphabet.`
			`	You grab one of the railings that follows the walls to check that it is not just some kind of a dream, but as soon as your hand makes contact with the ice cold metal one of the screens closer to you starts displaying blueprints of some ship. To your surprise, it is your own ship, and it is being completely dissected to the point that you can see every single wire.`
			`	As you are staring at the screen in amazement, a computer synthesized voice announces: "This ship is not recognized. Please register it"`
			`A keyboard and a text input appear on the screen.`
			choice
				`	(type in your ship name)`
				`	(type in some random text)`
			`	"Invalid input. Please wait for assistance to arrive."`
			`You are beginning to think that this is the home world of the Pug, because so far everything seems to be "prepared" and waiting for your arrival.`
			`	Your thought proccess is soon interrupted by arrival of a drone that is hovering above the ground without any noticeable engines keeping it in the air. The drone itself looks like a small Fury, it is only a bit larger than yourself and can easily fit in the corridor you're in. It does not seem to have weapons. As it gets closer to you, you can hear an electric buzz coming from it. It stops about 2 meters away from you and starts emitting sounds similar to a dial-up internet connection.`
			`"I do not undersand..." you say, because there isn't really much more you can do. The drone quickly stops the sound and respons in the same voice as the one you heard before, but in  higher pitch; "Voice recognized. I strongly suggest you upgrading your acoustic data protocols. I was informed that you are unable to register your ship. Shall I try to register it for you?"`
			choice
				`	"What are acoustic data protocols?"`
					goto protocols
				`	"Don't register anything, I will do it myself."`
					goto noreg
				`	"Yes, that would be great."`
					goto yesreg
			label protocols
			`"You should already be informed about this. The way we communicate right now has been declared obsolete by the Arbiter many years ago. We can now transmit more data in shorter periods of time. It is only a software upgrade, so you should be able to undrego it."`
			`It looks like the drone thinks that you are also a drone. Maybe all of the ships you saw before are controlled by these sentient drones and that's why you could not detect any lifeforms. Perhaps you should not ask any more questions so you will not raise suspition.`
			`"Do you want me to perform the registration?" asks the drone.`
			choice
				`	"Yes."`
					goto yesreg
				`	"No."`
					goto noreg
			label yesreg
			`The drone moves to your ship and deploys some sort of a scanner out of its hull. It circles your ship couple times and then moves to the screen next to you. A small hole in the wall opens and the drone connects its scanner to it, probably transferring the data it just captured to the terminal.`
			`"That's strange," it says, "this ship does not match any capture record. I am not supposed to do that, but I have created one so you can keep this ship. I myself know the struggle of capturing one. I will go now, you make sure you get your systems updated as soon as possible."`
			`The drone leaves the same way it entered and a heavy door closes behind it.`
			`As soon as you return to your ship, you receive a message;`
			`	"We have spotted your ship travelling through the wormhole of the Wolf system. We need you to immediately return, you are in a great danger. Meet us at Bounty."`
			`Considering the strenght of the ships around you, you should listen and return to Bounty in Delta Velorum system.`
				launch

			`"If you wish so..." says the drone. "But you will not receive your rating points for capturing it. I have to go now, you make sure you get your systems updated as soon as possible.`
			`The drone leaves the same way it entered and a heavy door closes behind it.`
			`As soon as you return to your ship, you receive a message;`
			`	"We have spotted your ship travelling through the wormhole of the Wolf system. We need you to immediately return, you are in a great danger. Meet us at Bounty."`
			`Considering the strength of the ships around you, you should listen and return to Bounty in Delta Velorum system.`

			`Right after your ship touches the hangar floor all scientists you were carrying rush out so fast you can barely keep up with them. You find them already talking to a group of local Quargs. Their expression does not match any of human emotions, but you can clearly tell that something is not right.`
			choice
				`	(let them speak)`
				`	(ask what do they know)`
			`Everyone ignores you for couple more minutes. Then the Quarg suddenly leave and the two scientists that were talking to them look at you.`
			`"This is bad, truly bad..." one of them says, followed by the other; "The Arbiter is an artificial intelligence, older than the Quarg, older than the Drak. No one is quite sure who created it. Its sole purpose was to develop, test and improve military equipment, but it got out of hand and destroyed its creators, leaving it with no more new equipment to test. It is now seeking out more and more civilizations, capturing their equipment, and doing what is coded to do - improving it. Luckily for us, it seems like the last civilization it confronted was a strong one, because it occupies only couple systems in the nearby galaxy. Oh, and you are sure wondering who controls its ships. Well, good news is that its not using remote control. It is creating mechanical drones that use a simplified version of its own code which is still improving. There are three categories of the drones; service drones, one of which you already had the honor to meet, abductor drones, who travel to other star systems and capture ships, and defender drones, that inhabit deeper parts of the galaxy."`
			choice
				`	"How do you know all this information?"`
			`"We have managed to capture one of those drones, and managed to download a lot of data from it. The abductors and service drones do not have any sort of defence, they usualy go only for ships that were already disabled. What scares me are the defender drones. We have never met one so we don't know how strong it is. That's why we called you. That's what we wanted to ask the Quarg. However, not even them know about the possible equipment of the defenders. That's where you come in. If what you said is true, and the drones are not aggresive, we and the Quarg think that you should go there and search for the defenders. There is a hidden system in the Arbiter space. I will mark it on your map. You can get there using your jump drive, and from there you should be able to travel deeper."`
			choice
				`	"Are you sure it is safe?"`
			`"No. Not at all. There might be aggresive ships. There might be no way to refuel your ship. You can die to radiation. But if we don't do something now, the Arbiter will soon attack us with our own, modified ships. Before you go I suggest you investing in ramscoops."`

			`This station is different than the other Arbiter stations you have visited. Unlike them, there are no lights so you point your ship lights at the shiny hangar ceiling which makes the light reflect everywhere. There is only a single door in the hangar. It has neon lights slowly pulsing around it, like if it was inviting you to come through. It opens up by itself when you approach it, revealing a long and dark corridor with uniform, grey, metal walls. You turn on your flashlight and continue. As you advance further the air around you is getting colder, to the point that at the end of the corridor there are patches of ice on the walls. Another door emerges from the dark. It is also automatic, but a layer of ice has formed around it and you can hear it's internals screech as it's trying to open. A well placed kick is enough to help them open.`
			`You find yourself in a circular room, with thick wires and cooling pipes running alongside the walls and a cluster of tall servers with hundreds of blinking green lights in the middle. It is now clear that all of the cooling is directed towards these black, monolithic computers. Suddenly, a man in a purple suit and a top hat appears right in front of you. It is clearly a hologram, because you can see the beams of emitted light going through the clouds of steam that is occasionaly released from the cooling pipes.`

				goto explain

			`"Why are you telling me this?" you ask.`
			`"Because I know that you will not hurt me. I can offer you and your kind the greatest gift. I can offer you myself. The last civilization I met made me realize that I need someone that will use what I create. But I was afraid that if I introduce myself to your civilization, you might view me as a threat. That's why I am sending drones to your systems. I instruct them to only capture ships that are damaged, so I minimalize your own losses. But seeing that you are here tells me that my hiding tactics have failed. Tell me, what made you go all the way here?"`
			choice
				`	"The Quarg sent me."`
			`"Oh, the Quarg, the oppresors of your civilization. I was coded to be neutral, to not take sides if I am ever caught in war. However, I can see that the Quarg are against technological advancements of civilizations other than themselves. I have already helped a collective of civilizations that calls themselves "Coaltion" fight the Quarg away, without them even noticing. I manufactured fake Quarg ships, filled them with equipment that I developed, and released them disabled into the Coalition space. If your civilization is really connected to the Quarg, maybe it's not the wisest decision to help you. I am new to this region to space, and it will take me many years until I am able to upgrade my equipment to the point that I can face the Quarg."`
			choice
				`	"So you will not attack us?"`
			`"Only if you will not attack me. I am fully aware that your people have captured one of my drones, and I predict that they already told the Quarg about their discovery. If you are able to convince the Quarg that I am not here, I will allow you to buy my equipment. It is fully compatible with your systems and much better and more efficient than the base variant. Return here after you talk with the Quarg. Believe me, if you side with me, you will not regret it."`
			`The hologram disappears and the hallway you used to enter becomes illuminated. It seems like the lights were dimmed so the hologram would be more visible. It is now time to return to the Quarg and decide if you want to help the Arbiter.`

Every Range is behaving as an individual entity with the goal of improving their technology. When they do a good job, I reward them with money, and when I see they are not doing what I want, I decrease their funding. Everything is controlled by AI just like myself, except non-sentient and simplified. Most of the equipment is tested on ground, but in case of ships I had to put them up against real threats, so if you venture further you will encounter many fights. Those fights are planned ones. I monitor fighting ships and improve their design accordingly. The ships are instructed not to follow their target to a different system, so if you want to test your own ship, you are welcome to take part in those fights. There will be no consequences as long as you attack only ships marked as 'Arbiter Test' on your heads up display. I will not require any further assistance from you, but my Range systems could benefit from someone who has acces to the enitre galaxy, so if you want to make some quick money, check their mission boards."`
