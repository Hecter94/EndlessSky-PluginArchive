WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

  "The Peacebringer is a one of a kind ship, commissioned not for sport, nor in exchange for money, or any other material offering that could conceivably produce any standard spacecraft into reality, but instead as a reparation to a remarkable individual who has woven together the failing strings of the galaxy with their bare hands; a gift to one who has saved humanity one or more times from an otherwise hopeless drive to extinction. It is tribute, to ensure that this individual, whomever they may be, can continue their extraordinary drive to keep the universe together."
~ shipyard description

The Peacebringer is (going to be) a near end-game flagship "rewarded" to the player immediately after the (spoilers!) Kor Sestor missions involving their breach of human space. Well, when I say "rewarded", I mean that they're going to be sent across the galaxy on a wild goose chase for the most advanced technologies that each species has to offer in order to build, piece by piece, the most powerful starship that humanity has ever witnessed. A culmination of all creations advanced and arcane combined together into an unmatched set of speed, firepower, stealth, and modularity, the Peacebringer is kind of like the Heron in the sense that it fucks shit up, just slightly less so.

To-do, generally:
- find appropriate, somewhat lore-friendly way to introduce
- model ship, and custom outfits (if any)
- outfit the ship
- create gathering missions
- snort ringworld shavings
