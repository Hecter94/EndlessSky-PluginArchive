	description "This unusual turret was designed as a counter to burst fired missile barrages. The standard Wanderer Anti-Missile can destroy almost any missile in a single shot, but is limited by its fire-rate. This version solves that problem at the cost of endurance. While the Energy Core system improves the fire-rate by a factor of ten, it risks complete depletion of anti-missile capacity."

	description "This unusual turret was designed as a counter to burst fired missile barrages. Most anti-missile systems are limited by the amount of energy they can pump through their systems. This weapon, produced by Deep research facilities, avoids thats problem by way of disposable energy cores. These non-rechargeable cores have massive energy densities and can replace that energy with heat as it is depleted. Combined with rapid cycling systems, they allow a greatly improved fire rate."

	description "A prime example of Wanderer ingenuity, Thunderhead missiles each carry five submunitions that are capable of independent tracking. Even if the target is able to shoot down or evade a few of them, the remaining missile fragments will still find their mark."
	description "The Wanderers' militarization has seen the venerable Thunderhead Launcher struggle to meet the needs of Wanderer capital ships. The solution is far more than a mere sidearm for plus size vessels. The Auto-Launcher has a fire rate thrice that of its smaller cousin and an arsenal of twice the size. The only downside is that you're getting weird looks for writing 'Macross Missile Massacre' on the firing control."
