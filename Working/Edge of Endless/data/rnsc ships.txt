	description "The smallest vessel in the Republic Navy equipped with a hyperdrive, the Troopshuttle is manufactured by Betelgeuse Shipyards under a military contract with the Republic Navy. With many components borrowed from the popular commercial models of the Shuttle and Heavy Shuttle, the Troopshuttle is less expensive than most Navy ships and is a common first posting for Navy pilots fresh out of the Academy. Although far more cramped than its commercial cousins, the Troopshuttle is faster and more heavily armored, able to withstand combat environments for limited periods."

	description "Once the pinnacle of interceptor combat, the Navy Starfighter has been an icon of the RNSC since the Martian Navy Works began churning them out in 3028. Limited in operational range but wickedly fast and lethal in a dogfight, the Starfighter highlighted the vast technology gap between the Free Worlds and the Republic at the time of its release, precipitating a prolific arms race in warship technology and fleet building and nearly a century of terse and postured galactic cold war that continues to the present day. Originally flown by the elite pilots of the RNSC Special Tactics Group (STG), the Starfighter has waned in popularity since its introduction due to obsolescence and limited range, but is still widely used by the Navy for patrolling merchant space and hunting pirates."

	description "The interceptor of choice by the RNSC Special Tactics Group, the Starfighter Advanced is - simply put - the most advanced interceptor craft ever devised. The result of a split military contract bid between Tycho Corporation, Lionheart Industries, and the Syndicate, the Strategic Advantage Space Superiority Interceptor Commission (SASSIC) began in the 3080s and evolved into one of the longest and costliest weapons programs in Naval history. When it completed, however, a craft was put into production that pushed the Republic's interceptor technology beyond that of its adversaries and returned the RNSC to its rightful throne as the most advanced and well-equipped fighting force in the galaxy."

	description "Chances are if you're an RNMC grunt, you've spent more hours staring at the stark durasteel interior of a Navy Dropship than you've spent staring at blue sky. Built for delivering space marines from orbit, the Dropship can take a beating like no other transport in the galaxy, that is, until it gets caught in a thermonuclear blast or vaporized by orbital artillery. Dropships and Dropship pilots have the shortest life expectancy in the RNSC; in the Front, the average craft goes from assembly line to a mangled cloud of orbiting shrapnel in approximately 22 days."

	description `In actuality a compact-frame derivative of the Cruiser, the Destroyer is the fastest warship in the Republic Navy. Primarily equipped with anti-fighter missile weapons, the aptly-nicknamed "Interceptor Hunter" reserves minimal power and cooling capacity for armaments and instead dedicates the majority of these resources to its disproportionately massive engines. Ludicrously fast and nimble despite its considerable size and shield capacity, Destroyer crews are a master class in strafing tactics; nose-to-tail spin in 4 seconds, charge guns-blazing into a fighter squadron, afterburner drift into maximum angle of attack, repeat from the rear.`

	description "Sacrificing speed, range, and cargo space for heavier armament and fortified hull plating, the Republic Heavy Cruiser is unequivocally the most powerful fixed-armament vessel in the Republic Navy. Commissioned by the Admiralty to face the new threat of the Free Worlds' Dreadnought, even the most formidably shielded of warships are reduced to molten slag under the withering onslaught of the Heavy Cruiser's twelve fire-linked particle cannons and four Heavy Laser turrets."

	description `The Republic Battlecruiser is the pride of the Navy. Often used as a staging area for ground operations, the Battlecruiser typically carries a full battalion of Republic Marines in addition to standard crew. Nearly twice the size of the Carrier, the Battlecruiser is the Republic's tactical anchor in prolonged direct-combat engagements, able to maintain a steady stream of firepower from its twelve turrets and two artillery cannons. Housing a sizable complement of 8 drones, the Battlecruiser also provides state-of-the-art guided munitions deterrence via the Heavy-Radiation-Environment Tactical Intercept Countermeasure Computer (HRETICC). Designed by Navy Engineers to withstand a direct hit from a nuclear weapon, the Battlecruiser is truly a force to be reckoned with.`

	description `Few ships of the scale of the Republic Battlecarrier exist in human space. The largest carrier vessel built by Republic Navy Yard, the Battlecarrier supports two squadrons of fighters, the largest complement of any vessel in the Republic Navy. Primarily intended for distance engagements, the Battlecarrier is equipped with IM-PACT broadside particle artillery, AATLAS Torpedo Lauchers, and the Lovelace Military Research (LMR) Sidewinder Guided Munition Artillery-Assault System (SiGMAAS).`

	description "Of all the human vessels built since the first hyperdrive-capable vessels began to traverse the black void of space, no ship can match the Navy Battleship in size, complement, or legendary status. A gleaming plinth of civil order and federal might in an otherwise uncivilized universe, the Battleship is a testament to the vast resources and expansive military power of the Republic. Absurdly expensive to build and maintain, the Battleship takes over a decade to construct and costs nearly a billion credits. There are currently five Battleships in service and another two under construction at both Warfield and Federal Arsenal. Equipped with 24 Particle Cannon Turret batteries, two MTACs, AATLAS Torpedo Launchers, the SIGMAAS missile system, and 36 thermonuclear warheads, the two-point-five kilometer-long Battleship has been in service for nearly a quarter century and has never been defeated in combat, although allegedly one was sabotaged and captured by pirates somewhere north of the Front long ago. The flagship of the Republic Navy Space Command, the Battleship serves with harrowing effectiveness in fleet management, artillery support, and direct combat roles."

	description `The Republic Missile Cruiser is designed around two essential principles, both of which are the Massive Tactical Artillery Cannon (MTAC). Although only a few large ships can support even one of these weapons, the Artillery Cruiser fires two in salvo for a continous volley of unstoppable long-range hull-shattering bombardment.`
