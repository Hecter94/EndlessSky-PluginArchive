planet Albatross
	description `Albatross is a cold ocean world orbiting a small, cold sun. The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
	description `	Recently, the Free Worlds has liberated Albatross from their pirate oppressors, but many of the locals remain skeptical, seeing the Free Worlds as little different from the other protection rackets that have held sway over them.`
planet "Ingot"
	description `Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings. Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong.`
	description `Ingot shares an orbit with the largest Navy base in western space; orbiting approximately 4200 kilometers above the gax giant Cira, Australis Arsenal was built a half-century ago to house the growing numbers of Navy personnel garrisoned in the system. A major shipbuilding site for the Navy, components for Navy craft, particularly the Navy Heavy Cruiser, are built in factories on Ingot from alloys mined here and shipped to Australis Arsenal for assembly.`
planet "Bourne"
	description `Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled five centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet.`
	description `Bourne is also the seat of government for the Coalition of Free Worlds, an alliance of several dozen human colonies that declared independence from the Republic nearly a hundred years ago and have since expanded in power and influece into an independent military power in the southern galaxy.`
planet "New Austria"
	attributes warzone
	description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight. The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies; the sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry.`
	description `The Navy has recently requisitioned one of the abandoned mining towns and begun refurbishing it for a secure military base, with the mining tunnels used as deep underground bunkers.`
planet "New Wales"
	attributes warzone
	description `New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals. Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small.`
	description `The Republic Navy has planted a base on New Wales: so far, just a densely packed cluster of prefabricated barracks and infirmary buildings on the outskirts of one of the mining colonies.`
