	description "The Navy Research And Development - Lionheart Industries Combat Stealth Interference Device (LICoSID) combines cloaking capability and interference capability in a highly compact system. The system is so small, in fact, that it can even fit into fighters, although this is extremely rare due to the astronomical cost and energy requirements. Still an active Navy Research And Development Project, the same resonant electromagnetic phase shift technology that allows the system to operate also substantially interferes with the effectiveness of most small shield systems."

	description "The result of considerable investment by Navy Research and Development, the D14-Active Electromagnetic Phase Shift Compensator is a phase-compensated redesign of the D14-RN Shield Generator that allows interceptors and fighters to utilize the LICoSID without a considerable loss of shield effectiveness. While researching active-phase-shift shielding technology, NRAD Research Scientists also discovered that phase-shifted shielding technology is far more efficient at the fighter-interceptor scale than standard shielding technology, and is highly effective in non-LICoSID-equipped fighters and interceptors."

	description "It has commonly been known among hyperdrive designers for a number of decades that certain metals can be used to augment hyperdrive performance. When encased in Neodymium, the pseudoquantum gyroscope of the scram drive is less affected by radiation from power plants, engines, and weapons and can resolve to a directional heading much more quickly. Unfortunately, encasing a scram drive in 15 centimeters of neodymium shielding is heavy, expensive, and must absorb and dissapate the ambient alpha radiation of the drive core as heat."

	description "The seminal research project of the Navy Research and Development Advanced Hyperphysics Group (NRAD-AHG), the minidrive is a reduced-form-factor hyperdrive, small enough to fit into even fighter-size craft. Not without drawbacks, the miniaturized isolation core is far less efficient in spooling to the proper condensate density, and an enormous amount of waste heat is produced due to core saturation, particularly from radiative coupling when using sublight thrusters."

	description "The Navy Research and Development Solid Matter Active Collision Matrix is an experimental shaped-beam weapon designed for the Navy Special Tactics Groups. A solid-shield matrix affixed to various anchor generators throughout the superstructure of the ship, the SMACM allows STG Battlecruisers to combat large enemy vessels by simply colliding with them at high speed, often times breaking larger ships into multiple pieces with the SMACM absorbing most of the impact. For all intents and purposes, yes, it is a high-tech battering ram."
