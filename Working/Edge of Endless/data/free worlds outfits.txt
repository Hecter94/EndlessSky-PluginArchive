	description "The Heap Core is a massive capital ship fission reactor developed by Southbound Shipyards. Derived from the Stack Core, the Heap Core is more efficient than most fission reactors, but its massive size and heat output demonstrate the obvious point of diminishing returns in large-reactor fission technology."

	description "The Fulton Reactor is the first fusion-based reactor ever designed and built by the Free Worlds. Designed by painstakingly reverse-engineering the Armageddon Core, the Fulton Reactor is build from cheaper, lower quality alloys and uses an antiquated cooling system design grandfathered from the Stack Core, resulting in greater size, mass, and significantly diminished power efficiency. It is, however, cheaper than the Armageddon Core and easily mass-producable in facilities set up for fission reactor assembly."

	description "Essentially two Fulton Reactors stacked on top of one another and piped through the same archaic stack-based cooling system, the Double Fulton is the largest reactor made in the Free Worlds. Horrendously inneficient by modern standards, Freeworlder fusion technology lags decades behind that of the Republic and is a significant impediment to the Free Worlds in the galactic arms race for larger and more powerful warships."

	description "Designed Tarazed Shipyards, the Lattice Shield Generator consists of a highly compact generator core that creates a multi-layer interlocking energy lattice, the robustness of which is superior to anything created by humans thus far. The MT-30X is designed for light and medium warships or craft that may experience sporadic combat environments."

	description "In the roughly 150 years since its invention, the original Plasma Cannon has been continuously innovated into a variety of impressive weapons. Perhaps the most impressive - and most intimidating - is the liquid-cooled reciprocal-firing Heavy Plasma Turret. Utilizing a complex recoil compensator to pump coolant into the barrel housings, the engineers at Kraz Defense Systems were able to squeeze not two, but four seperate longbarrel plasma cannons into a turret fit for the Free Navy's largest Battlecruisers. With greater range, higher output, higher efficiency, and better accuracy than any plasma turret before it, the Heavy Plasma Turret ensures the Free Worlds is the dominant fighting force in the galaxy in close-quarters ship-to-ship combat."
