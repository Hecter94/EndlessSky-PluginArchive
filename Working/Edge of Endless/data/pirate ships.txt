	description "The Rainmaker is a missile boat built in the Republic Navy Yard. It comes equipped with four missile launchers and enough ammunition to destroy even ships many times its size. Because of their lack of maneuverability and relatively light shielding, Rainmakers serve best as long-range attack ships, and once their missile supply is spent, they are relatively useless in combat."

	description "Designed by the Syndicate as a one-ship cruiser-freighter solution for merchants transporting sensitive and valuable goods through the galaxy's more dangerous regions, the Echelon Armored Freighter-Cruiser is the closest thing the Syndicate manufactures to a Republic Battlecruiser. Always game for a bit of unscrupulous arms dealing on the side, the Syndicate quickly found that the vessel was far more popular and affordable to well-armed customers that paid in cash. Always seeking to better serve the consumer, the Syndicate migrated production of the Echolon Cruiser to the biggest off-the-books arms market in the galaxy, where the vessel gained instant popularity with the Front's countless pirates, mercenaries, guerillas, and revolutionary groups."

	description `Stolen by the Raider pirate clan nearly a decade ago after a reactor leakage "accident" killed all onboard crew and left the ship, this Battleship has terrorized the South and evaded the Free Navy for nearly 20 years. Permanently damaged during its sabotage and neglected of regular maintenence by the Raider clan, the vessel's hull integrity and shield strength have weakened over time, but is still a vessel feared and hated by all who traverse the South. Its captain, Raider King Killian Jass, was one of the most notorious pirates ever to roam the galaxy. He will not be missed.`
