	description "The Fast Breeder Reactor (FBR) is a high-output variant of the Breeder Reactor developed by Zvezda Drive Yards. With almost the output of the Fusion Reactor, the FBR is extremely space efficient, but produces an enormous amount of heat due to higher baseline radiation and conduction from its liquid metal ballast."

	description "The Bulldog Thrustlet is an alternative take on large-ship propulsion, created from licensed Delta V Corp. designs by Zvezda Drive Yards. Rather than a single set of large propulsion and steering thrusters, thrustlets distribute thrusting force through a number of smaller angled engines, allowing advanced propulsion vectoring and substantially increased maneuverability in large ships."
	description "	Plasma engines are a bit more powerful than ion engines of the same size, but they are less energy efficient and produce more heat."

	description "The Proton Turret is a Congo Military Industries-engineered turret version of the Syndicate Proton Gun. While the guerillas are certainly known for their political views, they are not quite as renowned for their engineering prowess, evidenced by the Proton Turret's innefficient design and excessive heat output."

	description "The Heavy Proton Cannon is a Congo Military Industries variant of the Syndicate Proton Gun designed for large Guerilla warships. By increasing beam power and slowing the velocity of the proton pulse through the barrel, an astronomical degree of firepower can be produced with considerably improved range over the standard proton gun. Due to the considerable space, heat, and energy requirements of the Heavy Proton Cannon, the weapon requires an artillery port in addition to a gun port."

	description "The Mass Laser is an extremely dangerous weapon, both for the ship it is aimed at and the ship it is mounted on. Designed by Congo Military Industries, it is essentially a Heavy Laser with the power cranked up by a factor of ten and the beam optics removed completely. While this increases the range and the damage considerably, the weapon has become extremely unstable and wildly innacurate, often running hot enough to warp the gun ports it is mounted in."

	description "The Turbolaser is one of the most powerful weapons in the galaxy. Requiring a massive reactor and a collosal amount of cooling, the weapon can only sustain a coherent beam for a few seconds before draining the most massive of batteries and sending ship temperatures to dangerously high levels. This weapon requires an artillery port."

	description "Designed from plans stolen by a defecting Republic engineer, the Javelin Turret is a set of four Javelin Pods welded together and, ironically, installed on a heavy anti-missile turret base. The turret lacks the accuracy of the pod, but dishes out considerably more damage and is mounted on a swivel. Due to its high reload cost and large size, the turret is typically used sparingly, but has quickly gained notoriety for its impressive ability to overwhelm entire batteries of anti-missile turrets."

	description `The Vulcan Cannon is a rudimentary gunpowder weapons design produced by Zvezda Drive Yards, primarily used by guerilla fighters and mercenaries on the Front. With a longer range and higher damage than the Gatling Gun, the Vulcan is highly effective on small craft when used against larger ships, but any space that is saved compared to a laser cannon will most likely go straight back into cooling.`

	description "In many cases, troopers who survive their mandatory four-year deployment in the RNMC will go on to pursue a lucrative career as a private contractor in one of many mercenary groups throughout the galaxy. Most groups charge a time-deductable staffing deposit along with continous operating costs during deployment. Although mercs are highly effective in capturing vessels, they do not pilot captured vessels for liability reasons and additional non-merc crew must be retained for this purpose. For private merchants with sufficient credits and bunk space, this is the closest thing you can buy to a private army."
