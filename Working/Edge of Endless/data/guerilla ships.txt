	description `Designed in secret, the Cobra Gunship is Zvezda Drive Yards' contribution to the Guerilla cause. Essentially an armored Lancehead frame stuffed with as many proton guns as allowed by the laws of thermodynamics, the targeting systems, batteries, and massive alien power plant are so large that the engines had to be moved to the same fixed-mount winglets as the guns due to limitations of heat and physical space. A response to the Navy Heavy Cruiser, the Cobra is designed to fulfill the Cause's need for a fixed-gun large assault craft to take on the massive cruisers and capital ships of the RNSC and their mercenary allies.`

	description `Designed by Congo Military Industries with covert funding from the Zvezdan government and engineers from Zvezda Drive Yards, the Anaconda Battlecruiser is the Four Systems's last, best hope in defeating the massive capital fleets of the RNSC. Bristling with high-powered weaponry, innovative regenerator technology, a massive fission power plant, and a simple, yet ingenious thrustlet engine design, the Anaconda can outrun and outmaneuver any warship of equivalent size in the RNSC fleet and is well-armed enough to engage and pulverize enemies of the Cause at any distance.`

	description `A larger heavy-artillery variant of the Anaconda, the Acanthopis is the largest ship in the Junta fleet. Designed for capital ship bombardment, the Acanthopis is able to release fusillades of energized plasma from its four cannons or engage targets from closer distance with the fearsome Javelin Turrets and Dual Gatling Turrets. The most terrifying of the Acanthopis' arsenal is the Turbolaser, a massive beam cannon capable of destroying even the largest of capital ships from several kilometers away.`
