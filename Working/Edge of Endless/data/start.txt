	`With some trepidation, you initial your enlistment papers, glancing past the lines regarding desertion and court-martialing procedures and eagerly reading the section on combat pilot school and the large signing bonus you'll be receiving.` 
	name
	`Confident you've made the right decision, you hand the signed documents back to the buzz-cut recruitment officer. A voice behind you barks out a throaty growl, startling you:`
	`	"I remember the day I signed up," he says. "Nothing quite like the feeling, knowing you're serving the Republic, fighting the good fight, facing down rebellion and piracy, conquering and serving justice in the ranks of glorious brotherhood."`
	`You turn, and see the voice belongs to a grizzled man in Navy Officer fatigues and a single silver eagle indicating his rank as that of Captain.`
	`	"Captain Janus Griggs. I'll be your commanding officer. At ease, ensign"`
	choice
		`	"Greetings, sir. Very excited to be here, sir. Ready, willing, and able, sir."`
			goto sir
		`	"It's a pleasure to meet you, Captain. I look forward to serving under you."`
			goto sir
		`	"Hah. Oh Captain not my captain."`
			goto smartass
	label sir
	`	He grins. "I have a feeling, you're going to fit right in, Ensign..." He glances at your paperwork, "<last>. So tell me, why did you join up?"`
		goto joinup
	label smartass
	`	"I see we've got ourselves a smartass." The Captain frowns, his moustache creasing downward. "Bag a couple Dropship sorties out on the Front and we'll cure that attitude soon enough. Or make it worse, if you're one of *those* ensigns. What brings you to my unit, Martian?"`
		goto joinup
	label joinup
	choice
		`	"I'm here to kick Freeworlder ass and take names, sir!"`
		`	"I love flyin', and I hear you'll pay me to do it. I'm in."`
		`	"Just wanted to get off this rock and see that galaxy, I guess."`
	`	The captain laughs, a barely audible chuckle that rumbles from deep in the chest. "Well, you're in the right place, kid. Let's say we saddle up and head on over to Federal Arsenal? You'll be flying - I bet you've never handled anything like a Navy ship before. Careful with the throttle; these boats can break 9 G's easy."`
	choice
		`	"Sounds good!"`
			goto end
		`	"So when do I get my bonus?"`
	`	The Captain raises an eyebrow "As you should've read in your enlistement papers, you're receiving 1.5 million credits towards the aquisition of your first vessel, which is currently sitting in a hangar at the other end of the concourse. As an ensign, you receive a 100-credit per-diem salary with payscale increases upon rank."`
	choice
		`	"Wait...what do you mean, aquisition?"`
			goto aquisition
		`	"That's really generous. Thank you."`
			goto end
	label aquisition
	`	"The RNSC and the Navy both have a policy of you-break-it, you buy-it," he says. "Warships are expensive. We've found that in a capitalist galaxy, capitalism is the one thing that protects our ships better than anything else. The strength of our ideology is the strength of our Navy, so to speak."`
	`	"How does anyone in the Navy afford it?"
	`	The Captain laughs "Ensign <last>, as you well know, Navy grunts are a resourceful bunch. What we don't pay you for good work, you'll find a way to make up in side income from any ships you capture. As an officer, you have full autonomy over any derelict salvage you may come across or create in the course of battle." says Griggs. "How else do you think we've tripled our recruitment numbers in the last decade? Every ship you disable is yours."`
	choice
		`	"That's insane."`
		`	"That's awesome!"`
	`	The Captain laughs again "It's necessity, kid. You'll find this Navy - and if you ask me - the galaxy at large, usually runs on profit. If that's what keeps the garrisons manned when doom is at the door, I can live with it, and so can 2.69 billion other Navy grunts."
	choice
		`	"I see."`
			goto end
	label end
	`	"Great," he says. "Welcome to the Republic Navy Space Command, Ensign <last>."`
	`	As you leave the concourse and head to the hangar, the Captain walks ahead of you to a small group of 8 or so young ensigns in RNSC uniforms. "Greetings, new recruits. As you join the hallowed ranks of the RNSC, you do so in a time of great need. Never before has the Republic faced so many external threats. The growing fleets of the Free Navy. Our Confederate defectors to the far North. Guerillas, new rebels intent on sewing the sentiments of anarchy and a new socialist order on independent colonies under Republic protection. Invaders from beyond the Front, who will stop at nothing to seek out and exterminate humankind from the universe. These are your enemies. These are the agitators of subterfuge, of dangerous, radical ideologies; of our very extinction. We must crush them, or be obliterated. Officers, what say you?"`
	`	"FOR ORDER. FOR JUSTICE. FOR GLORY. OOH-RAH" The hangar echoes with the thunderous call.`
	`	"As you look beyond, at the other end of the hangar sits an array of gleaming black Navy ships, fresh off the Martian Navy Works assembly line. As you come closer, you see there are two varieties to choose from; a newer-model light armored transport, or a older-model patrol interceptor."`
