	description `The Confederate Navy Yard Carrier II Supercarrier is the Confederate Navy's primary fighter-carrier for prolonged large-fleet engagements. With an extended complement of eight fighter bays and six drone pods, the Supercarrier class has historically supported an entire squadron, most notably the infamous "Dragons of the Deep" Special Tactics Group (111th Fighter Wing), established during the Alpha Wars, and the "Betelgeuse Bastards" Expeditionary Force (38th Fighter Wing), who trace their centuries-old lineage to the founding of the Confederate itself.`

	description `In actuality a compact-frame derivative of the Cruiser, the Confederate Corvette is the fastest warship in the Confederate Navy. Primarily equipped with anti-fighter missile weapons, the aptly-nicknamed "Interceptor Hunter" reserves minimal power and cooling capacity for armaments and instead dedicates the majority these resources to its disproportionately massive engines. Ludicrously fast and nimble despite its considerable size and shield capacity, Destroyer crews are a master class in strafing tactics; nose-to-tail spin in 4 seconds, charge guns-blazing into a fighter squadron, afterburner drift into maximum angle of attack, repeat from the rear.`

	description `The Confederate Battlecruiser is the pride of the Confederate fleet. Often used as a staging area for ground operations, the Battlecruiser typically carries a full Battalion of Confederate Troopers or CNSC Secret Police in addition to pilots and crew. Nearly twice the size of the Carrier, the Battlecruiser is the Confederate's tactical anchor in prolonged direct-combat engagements, able to maintain a steady stream of firepower from its twelve turrets and six fixed guns. Housing a sizable complement of drones and fighters, the Battlecruiser also provides state-of-the-art guided munitions deterrence via the Heavy-Radiation-Environment Tactical Intercept Countermeasure Computer (HRETICC). Designed by Navy Engineers to withstand a direct hit from a nuclear weapon, the Confederate Battlecruiser is truly a force to be reckoned with.`

	description `Few ships of the scale of the Confederate Navy Yard Carrier III Battlecarrier exist in human space. Larger than even the Confederate Battlecruiser, the Battlecarrier supports two squadrons of fighters, the largest complement of any vessel produced by the Confederate Navy Yard. Primarily intended for distance engagements, the Battlecarrier is equipped with Torpedo Lauchers and the Lovelace Military Research (LMR) Sidewinder Guided Munition Artillery-Assault System (SiGMAAS).`

	description "Of all the ships designed and built by Confederate Navy Yard, the largest in the history of the Navy is the Confederate Battleship. Absurdly expensive to build and maintain, the Battleship takes nearly a decade to construct and the frame alone costs over a billion credits. There are currently five Battleships in service and another under construction at Warfield Arsenal. Equipped with 22 Particle Cannon Turret batteries, four MTACs, and the SIGMAAS missile system, the two-point-five kilometer-long heavy warship has been in service for nearly a half century and has never been defeated in combat, although allegedly one was sabotaged and captured by pirates somewhere north of the Front around the turn of the century. The flagship of the Confederate Navy Space Command, the Battleship serves with harrowing effectiveness in fleet management, artillery support, and direct combat roles."

	description "The Striker is an interceptor-class warship often used as an escort for freighters or in a planetary militia's patrol squadron. Hawks are fast enough to chase down most smaller ships, while also being much more heavily armed and armored. They are also, of course, a favorite ship of pirate captains who have earned enough money to afford one."
