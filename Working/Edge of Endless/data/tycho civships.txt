	description `A slightly higher grade of the original Centennial, the Centennial Elite is more popular among travelers of the Paradise Worlds and vacationers to the more tourist-centric Tycho colonies. With significantly more legroom, superior facilities, and marginally more shielding than the standard model, the Elite is certainly worth considering for its appeal to the luxury transport market.`

	description `Seeing the popularity of large freighters such as the Bulk Freighter and Behemoth, Tycho Shipyards distilled all of the superstructural engineering and lightweight metallurgy knowledge at their disposal into designing and building the first supermassive freighter, the Colossus. With over four times the capacity of a bulk freighter, the Colossus is less cost-effective than the Bulk Freighter or Behemoth per ton, but due to its size and considerable mass, far more immune to the often-overwhelming pirate raids of Farspace. Dwarfing most other ships, the Colossus simply barrels through flotillas of pirates and marauders, with a massive enough hull to take the immense punishment and fuel capacity to make most runs with a minimal need for fuel stops.`

	description `If there were a ship in the galaxy to hold the title "Largest Ever," the Tycho Centennial is probably the most common candidate to be found among the residents of the known universe. A full 278 meters longer than even a Republic Battleship, the Centennial is hardly a warship, instead a super-size transport vessel originally built to ferry colonists and travelers to, from, and among the Northern and Western Colonies en masse. Finding service elsewhere in the galaxy, the Centennial has become a popular vessel for ferrying colonists and tourists along the jam-packed hyperspace lines between the Rim, the Core, and Earth, and is the primary vessel of Tycho Starlines, the foremost passenger transport conglomerate in the western regions of the galaxy.`

	description `The Colonial is the ship that started it all. First built in the 2930s by Narlen Tycho and a small group of trusted engineers and mechanics, most of the colonists presently living in the Northern and Western Colonies came to their new worlds in Tycho Colonials, or are direct descendants of those bold few who ventured further from Earth than any human before in these great vessels. With immense fuel capacity, reinforced hulls, advanced high-reliability life support, and greater range than any ship before, the Colonial, first of the colony ships, marked a new age of human exploration and colonization into the great expanse of the universe.`

	description "Tycho's effort in the challenging and competitive midsize freighter market, the Cobalt never really took off in the same manner as the Freighter or Hauler; not for lack of quality or features, but more as a simple result of market saturation. Nevertheless, within Tycho's corporate empire, the Cobalt is conveniently the only freighter that meets Tycho's stringent Colonial Freighter Safety Requirements (CFSRs), so if only by the grace of a blatantly anti-competitive set of corporate government policies, the Cobalt is the most common freighter in the western half of Farspace."

	description "Seeing opportunity just below the scale of the Freighter and Hauler, Tycho Shipyards determined they could build a faster, lighter, more manueverable freighter with relatively minimal impact on cargo space for effectively the same price as larger, slower competitors. While this determination only proved provisionally true, the Corona is effectively a scaled-up version of the Shuttle, and has proven itself a popular ship for much more than cargo hauling due to its significant versatility."
