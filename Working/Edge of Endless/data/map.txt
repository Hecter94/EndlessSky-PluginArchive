planet Badland
	landscape land/tychodesertpirate1
	description `Badland, once known as Tycho IIX, is a desert world, primarily inhabited by pirates. After terraforming and drilling out the primary subsurface deposits of ore and petroleum in the 2990s, Tycho Colonial Mining discovered that the planet was not as resource-rich as initial surveys had speculated, and the operation was abandoned on account of the "bad land". Following the collapse of the Tycho-monopolized petroleum and mining industries, petroleum workers and miners began raiding supply convoys to nearby Centennial Station, and after a few years of this, Badland became known as the underworld nexus of the Northern Colonies.	`
	spaceport `The spaceport is basically a series of flat concrete pads slowly sinking into the desert sand around them. Other than that, just a whole lot of sand.`

Between the colonization of Tycho II and III, ColonyCorp used blizzard as a testing ground for a new method of atmospheric modification intended to create oxygen-nitrogen atmospheres on planets with abundant frozen water; within approximately a decade of beginning the experiement, it became clear not only that the method worked, but also that it was prohibitively expensive to maintain at breatheable levels, and that climate stabilization would be impossible with a -135 degree celcius daytime high at the planet's sunny equator. Abandoning the project, the discarded terraforming facilities became a nest of pirates and renegades, many of them rumored to be Cartel-backed mercenaries paid to distrupt Tycho shipping and trade lines to the Northern and Western Colonies`
	spaceport `The spaceport is essentially a snowfield next to a large concrete complex half-buried in snow. A scrapyard with a small collection of apparently running ships for sale sits buried close by; a sign reading "Used, salvage, no titles - cheap" makes you wonder what became of the ship's prior owners, but the rough-looking characters carousing the scrap heaps don't seem dissuaded.`

	description `An abandoned Tycho hyperspace fuel refinery, Calico Station is a creaking, decaying hulk. Estimates of those who actually live on the station are anywhere from the hundreds to a thousand vagrants, pirates, mercenaries, thieves, and general lowlifes habitat the station (or at least use it as a place to dock a ship with a more breathable atmosphere). Many of the station's support systems are offline; docking is manual, and only about half of the original airlocks even appear servicable. It may not seem like it, but Calico is the nexus of the Western Colonies' underbelly; if you need something shady, this is the place to go.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is....a bomb waiting to happen. Due to numerous leaks in plumbing, thermal management, and life support systems, the bottom two levels of the station are filled with a combination of hyperspace fuel ballast, water, conventional petroleum, and coolant that sits somewhere between highly toxic and highly flammable depending on the week. The only thing keeping the entire station from going up is the relatively anoxic atmosphere, which sits at around 7% oxygen and is evident in the bloodshot eyes and sluggish movement of those unlucky enough to call the station home. Hazard suits are recommended.`

One of the more populated planets of the Frontier, Cascadia falls under a loose classification of Republic protectorate that somehow pays full taxes for only a fraction of the obligatory protection offered by the Republic. Managing to barely stay independent of pirate control through a lopsided combination of hired mercenaries and the occasional RNSC sensor patrol, Cascadia has a tenuous relationship with the RNSC and there are rumours that the Junta may soon be welcoming a fifth member.`

Originally terraformed by the Syndicate in the hope of monopolizing Far West food production, the Syndicate believed they could cultivate massive colonies of consumable protein-rich surface algae and put their arid-farming competitors on New Colorado out of business. Complications in the terraforming process due to the unique atmosphere combined with the significant distance from patrolled space quickly drove the operation out of business, and the Syndicate abandoned the planet. The remaining algae farmers quickly found raiding nearby shipping convoys was far more profitable than algae farming and the derelict processing vessels became floating pirate fortresses.`
	spaceport `The spaceport sits on top of a massive durasteel platform splayed between the rusted hulks of two massive floating pontoons. After one of the roughest landings of your life, you climb out of the ship to realize the two pontoons are actually the partially-submerged frames of two gutted bulk freighters, with a massive network of rusted catwalks and scaffolding extending across the surface and between the two ship frames. The entire structure shrieks and pitches back and forth as the waves roll beneath it. Not a moment later, you jump aside and silently thank yourself for your pilot's reflexes and for splurging on those magnetic docking clamps as a poorly secured Sparrow comes screeching across the wildly angled deck and careens into the ocean below.`

Masters of chemistry and physics, the Elladan reverse this process when a material device or object is no longer useful and it is reconstructed by this same method into something new. The Ellada call this process "ananéosi", or renewal.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a vast, gleaming stretch of silvery-chrome tubes and curves. Corinthian architecture is unique and advanced among even the Ellada, incorporating more metallic substances and utilizing hyperadvanced atomically-constructed materials.

Originally a frozen ice planet made uninhabitable by a highly eccentric elliptical orbit, Cyrene is also an astonishing feat of Elladan astroengineering and a testament to the immense power of the Elladan groupthought. Through the manipulation and projection of massive gravitron fields (the same fields that drive Elladan starship engines), Cyrene was gradually coaxed into a near-perfect circular orbit until approximately 86% of the planet's surface was liquid water. The Elladans simultaneously generated an Earth-like magnetic field around the planet by agitating the ferrous core into a molten spiral with surgically timed and placed fusion detonations. After only a few decades of terraforming, the planet was a mediterranian-climate paradise, and the Ellada have thrived here since.`
	spaceport `The spaceport, like all Elladan architectural engineering, is hardly distinguishable from the environment in which it is constructed. Massive landing pads are assembled from the waves themselves as ships touch down and are help up by inert hydrostatic nanoparticles, the Oriona, residing within the ocean itself. Linked to the Elladan groupmind, the Oriona interact with the saltwater to create isohedric shapes from seawater, giving the appearance of a living ocean. Self-reproducing, these particles inhabit every drop of seawater on Cyrene, but their presence is only known to the Ellada, who employ these particles to part the sea, walk on water, hyperswim, and even fly above the waves.

Believing the solution to perpetual balance in the planet's atmosphere to be a matter of carbon dioxide production, the Republic waived emissions regulations on the planet, intending to one day restore them. For a time, this process worked, but as many industrial corporations flourished in the following decades, the Republic's influence began to wane. When the time came for the atmosphere to maintain CO2 levels, nothing was changed, and within 20 years, the atmosphere was only toxic smog. With settlers leaving in droves, the planet became a graveyard for decommissioned ships while pirates fought over the scraps of a ruined world.`

It is not unheard of for a scavenger to plasma-torch open a longhull only to stumble upon several hundred mummified Graveyarders, silently asphysiated from a stuck-open nitrogen valve or torched alive after a sluggish oxygen balancer met some faulty wiring. Shivering in your pressure suit as you walk towards the airlock of the nearest longhull, you wonder if this is how the planet got its name.`

Seeking remedy, the Republic chose to cut Harlot loose and allowed the planet a comparatively generous self-government treaty, but this only accelerated Harlot's decline into free-fall. Reduced to only a few hundred million inhabitants, Harlot's independent government soon ceased to function entirely and the planet is now run by a loose coalition of mercenary groups.`

The initial experiments progressed amazingly well; the planet developed a breathable atmostphere in less than 20 years, and vibrant ecosystems of Earth-derived plant life had taken hold within half a century. It was at this time that Deep Sky began to realize something was wrong: within a 10-year period, rates of cancer on the planet were suddenly skyrocketing, and shortly after the 60-year mark, the death rate of the 1.5-million human population began skyrocketing.

When invaded by the CNSC, the independent-minded citizens of New Australia saw their new occupiers as even more unwelcome than the last, and enlisted the help of the growing Guerilla movement to resist these new invaders. Although politically independent from the Junta, New Australia supplies mined metals to the Junta in exchange for military aid.`

With gravity approximately 1/8th that of Earth, New California is known for its 1.5-kilometer-tall Lychango trees, a force-evolved hybrid of the mango and lychee with fruit that grow to roughly the size of a shuttlecraft when ripe. Exposed to a process of forced evolution, the hybrid flourished; its vascular system uninhibited by Earth gravity, the species grew nearly a thousand times in size over a few decades through a process of planetary insular gigantism accelerated by beta particle bombardment. One of the only arable planets in the sector, New California is primarily an exporter of Lychango fruit, although a growing arms and mercenary trade has begun taking hold in recent years.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is relatively sparse, a series of concrete pads set across from a broad array of concrete office buildings and solar collectors, near the epicenter of the planet's largest city. Home to just shy of a million inhabitants, New California is one of the more populated planets of the Frontier and falls under a loose classification of Republic protectorate that somehow pays full taxes for only a fraction of the obligatory protection offered by the Republic. Managing to barely stay independent of pirate control through a lopsided combination of hired mercenaries and the occasional RNSC sensor patrol, New California has a tenuous relationship with the RNSC and there are rumours that the Junta may soon be welcoming a fifth member.`

Unbeknownst to the Republic, the Syndicate's definition of "building the economy" had more to do with exploiting nonexistent Front-sector casino, narcotics, and labor laws and less to do with trading; within a decade of initial settlement, the planet had increased its gross domestic product by over 9000%, legalized nearly every known recreational drug, and shattered the record for more casinos per capita than any other planet in the galaxy.`

The Ellada embody this in a cosmic sense; nearly 3500 years ago, a small wormhole ferried the inhabitants of a small Greek village between Earth and a faraway world with almost identical composition and atmosphere. The years waxed and waned, and on the eve of the Greek empire's collapse, the wormhole dissappeared.

planet Tenerife
	attributes junkyard warzone
	landscape land/new_york_ruins_by_jonasdero-d35covg
	description `Once a great sister-world to Tycho Prime, the independent colony of Tenerife began as an industrial and mining colony on the edge of human space. Thriving and growing throughout the mid-30th century, the colony reached a population of nearly 40 million at its peak in the 2970s, one of the largest settlements in western farspace and the closest human settlement to the unstoppable wave of terror that would change humankind forever. On August 4th, 2976, Tenerife and seven other colonies were invaded by the Hylian Empire, a previouly unknown alien race of militant hive-mind reptilians from beyond the edge of farspace. With massive ships, far superior technology, and greater numbers, the Hylians decimated the populations of invaded territories and began expanding rapidly into human space. Natural predators, the Hylians spread across the galaxy in search of mammalian prey, eradicating and feeding on the human populations of invaded colonies at astonishing rates. Seeing the Hylians as a threat to the very existence of humanity, the Republic Parliament and Tycho Corporation together exhumed the sigil of the Republic Navy's most feared ancestor; a militarized force that had inspired faith in the minds of Republic citizens, fear in the hearts of pirates, and carried the Republic into a golden age. Called upon again in a time of great need, the Republic Navy Space Command, equipped by Tycho Corporation with the greatest human warships ever constructed, fought back the Hylians and has since held at bay the Hylian tide of destruction for more than 30 years. Confining the Hylians to so-called "buffer zones," the RNSC and Tycho Corporation fight an endless war against the Hylian threat.`

planet Tharn
	attributes farming mining colony
	landscape land/dinosaur1
	description `Tharn is an arid, rocky planet on the edge of inhabited space. Largely composed of scrub farmers and miners, the planet is marginally agrable compared to the rest of the region and provides much of the sector's food supply. Given the limited supply for the region, food prices are considerably inflated for an agricultural planet; given the planet's location at the nexus of RNSC-CNSC fighting, control of the planet's fragile government bounces regularly between occupying forces.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is not much more than a pockmarked series of concrete pads next to a compound of adobe buildings. If the planet were more than a few hundred thousand inhabitants, it would undoubtedly be a warzone, but since not much more than small independent villages scatter the sparsely populated surface, occupations are largely bloodless attempts to control disparate plots of land. In recent years, some attempts have been made by the Syndicate to consolidate these farms and fix food prices on the planet, but the CNSC has since seized and operated these holdings, marking a considerable downturn in Syndicate-CNSC relations.`

	spaceport `The spaceport is small and private, with only room for the occasional visitor and the half-dozen small freighters that periodically bring supplies to the facility and courier weapon and warship plans between the station and Junta Defense Force High Command. You walk through the main corridor of the facility, glass-windowed laboratories on either side full of beeping machines, test equipment, and engineers in clean suits. Although the facility does not formally sell anything, the prototypes designed in the lab are rumoured to be available to well-endowed sympathizers of the Cause for a fair contribution to the research endowment.`

Converted from a Zvezda freighter works, the facility is strategically invaluable to the Cause and is extremely well defended against RNSC attack. The only facility equipped to construct the Anaconda and Acanthopis Battleships, the Foundry produces warships at nearly twice the rate of Warfield Arsenal due to its highly automated construction process and broad implementation of additive manufacturing. Although Guerilla warships are not known for their durability when compared to RNSC cruisers and capital ships, they are built quickly and fielded en mass to disrupt the logical, organized fleet structure and fighter-driven tactics of the RNSC.`

Autowelders and autoframers race around sparking hulks of half-constructed Anacondas and Cobras, their skeletons visible beneath patches in half-applied armor plating. As you enter the main hangar, you see piles of spare components stacked nearly to the ceiling on the far right. To the far left, a rapid assembly gantry is attaching fuselage components to the unpainted frame of a Zvezda Viper, fabricating the entire craft in under a minute before placing it on the wide conveyor to the launch tubes.`

Home to nearly three billion inhabitants, Thebes is also home to the Codex, an immense glass and composite superstructure containing the sum knowledge of the Ellada; rich cultures and histories, beautiful art and music, and the greatest and most profound advances in human science and technology the universe has ever known. The key to the Codex is the Elladan technology of ene myalo, or "one mind," an ancient cybernetic enhancement that connects the consciousnesses of all Ellada through space and time. It is said that an Elladan is never truly alone; what she feels, all feel, what all know, she knows.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is gleaming and cathedral-like, the floor and vast buttresses constructed from a translucent material so clear, yet so strong in its composition that it is only perceptible at certain angles and bears the weight of many thousands of craft above the gleaming city and ocean beyond.

One of the only shipyards in the sector, Tosche sells a few small ships, mostly ZDY and Farspace models with a few smaller Betelguese and Tarazed imports, as well as a variety of outfits. And before you ask, no, they don't sell goddamn power converters.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is the top two decks of the station. Approximately the length of two bulk freighters end-to-end, the station is covered with docking ports and tether rings to keep the mechanics from floating out into the void while repairing hulls. Inside, the station is mostly deserted, although the lukewarm brown water auto-dispensed by the antiquated espresso vending machine on the main level seems potable enough.

After numerous costly failed colonization and terraforming projects in the mid-29th century, the Republic government no longer possesed adequete resources to fund further expansion. Facing a continual need for food and raw materials in the densely populated near-Earth worlds, the Republic began offering colony charters to corporations in exchange for a portion of the tax base and relaxed trade restrictions. While the Syndicate colonized the worlds that became the Core, the Tycho Corporation began expanding deep into Farspace and established the Northern and Western Colonies.`
	spaceport `An early experiment in privatized terraforming, Tycho I was terraformed utilizing a low-cost method that essentially involved bombarding the planet's extremely thick atmosphere with gaseous carbon dioxide until enough of a greenhouse effect existed that tundra plants could grow. Although this process never really resulted in a breathable atmosphere for humans, the thin 28% carbon dioxide atmosphere is enough for many alpine plants, and the planet's primary exports are soft lumber and terraforming equipment.`

Owing to the enormous amount of water left from surface ice and methane byproducts, the planet's surface is nearly 97% water, and only a handful of extremely tall mountains break the surface. The planet exports enormous quantities of water for other terraforming projects in the region and protein-rich food-grade algae from sea farms near the planet's equator.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is relatively sparse and uninteresting.

Once covered in a vast shallow ocean, Tycho III underwent a massive cataclysmic asteroid hit at some point in the past several million years, stripping the planet's surface water almost entirely and leaving a vast sandstorm-racked planet with a trove of oil wealth a few hundred meters beneath the surface. Due to its desolate location over two dozen jumps from the nearest large consumer market, the petroleum industry of Tycho III is almost constantly in greater supply of crude than there are freighters and tankers available to move it off-world, and the constant supply glut has produced one of the most lucrative petroleum shipping markets in the entire galaxy for those willing to make the haul.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is less of a spaceport than a flat swath of sand next to a hyperspace fueling station.
