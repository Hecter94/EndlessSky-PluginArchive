	description `Nicknamed "The Sprocket Rocket" for its near-legendary unreliability, the Rogue is Farspace engineering at its finest; take a set of thrusters built for a cruiser and bolt a flimsy lightweight aluminum cockpit and wings around it. Probably the fastest ship in the Wild East, the Rogue is a favorite of pirates and bounty hunters as it can outrun almost anything in the sector that could shoot it down. Inexpensive compared to other pursuit craft, the Rogue is a major liability in combat due to its extremely thin hull plating.`

Either way, at least there's some nice artwork to look at before you pass out at 14.5 g's. This is the fastest build of the Trident you've ever seen, and it has the price tag to match."
