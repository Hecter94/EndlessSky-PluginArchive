	description `This is the derelict hull of a Republic Battlecruiser, left with little more than an engine, a hyperdrive, and a power source. The Republic Battlecruiser is the pride of the Republic fleet. Often used as a staging area for ground operations, the Battlecruiser typically carries a full Battalion of Republic Marines or Navy Intelligence Special Forces (NISF) in addition to pilots and crew. Nearly twice the size of the Carrier, the Battlecruiser is the Republic's tactical anchor in prolonged direct-combat engagements, able to maintain a steady stream of firepower from its twelve turrets and six fixed guns.`

	description "This is the derelict hull of a Republic Battlecarrier, left with little more than an engine, a hyperdrive, and a power source. Few ships of the scale of the Republic Battlecarrier exist in human space. Larger than even the Republic Battlecruiser, the Battlecarrier supports two squadrons of fighters, the largest complement of any vessel produced by the Republic Navy Yard. Primarily intended for distance engagements, the Battlecarrier is equipped with four Torpedo Lauchers and the Lovelace Military Research (LMR) Sidewinder Guided Munition Artillery-Assault System (SiGMAAS)."
