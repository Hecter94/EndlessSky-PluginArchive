	description "The Mass Driver uses a shot of hyperdrive fuel and a substantial spark to begin IBS acceleration, which then continues through a series of superconducting helical electromagnets to muzzle velocity. Ships caught at point-blank range are treated to overheated systems and a significant push from the hyper-accelerated combusting hyperdrive fuel muzzle flareâ€¦and then the fully intact IBS. The weapon mostly shields the hull from damaging quantum flux, but as a side effect, acts like it's far more massive when installed on a ship. Make no mistake: this is long range support artillery, and ships carrying many of this weapon will require escort support."

	description "The Saber Beam is a recent development by the CNSC, a beam weapon that causes less damage per second than any beam on the market. It is extremely good however, at causing interruption of electrical and shielding systems. The impact plume of this weapon is especially spectacular, as ionized particles splash violently and ablate your target's shields and hull."

	description "This turret places the CNSC's recently developed Saber Beam weapon onto a rotating turret, providing unsurpassed accuracy for reducing the combat capability of nearby targets. This turret has integrated S.A.R.C., so it does not require extra crew (but does take up extra bunks, consumes a little energy all the time, and requires an equipped shield regenerator.)"
