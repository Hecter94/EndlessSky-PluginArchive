		log "Factions" "Republic" `Hundreds of years ago, the independent territories in different parts of human space agreed to join together into a single democratic government, with Earth as its capital. The rise of the Republic ushered in a long period of peace and prosperity in human history.`
			`Representation in the Republic Parliament is based on population. That means that some individual "Paradise Worlds" have more representatives than entire regions of space like the Dirt Belt that are more sparsely settled.`
		log "Factions" "Free Worlds" `Approximately 100 years ago, the Southern reaches of the Republic splintered suddenly into a new coalition of planets dissatisfied with lack of representation in the corrupt and bureaucratic Republic.`
			`With self-rule as their goal, they banded together around the creed of liberty and declared themselves an independent governing body from the Republic, taking up arms in the process. Since the independence, the Free Worlds have`
			`grown to challenge the Republic as an economic and military power, resulting in a nearly century-long arms and colonization race between the two nations.`
		log "Factions" "Syndicate" `The Syndicate is a megacorporation, the largest employer in human space. People who cannot find steady work elsewhere flock to the Syndicate factory worlds, where they are almost guaranteed to find a job. Although the Syndicate is technically part of the Republic, Syndicate worlds are governed directly by the corporation.`
			`The Syndicate is a central part of the Republic's economy, but they are also well known for selling shoddy products and for doing damage to the environment on the worlds they control. Their treatment of workers is questionable, and their opposition to organized labor is legendary. Some Syndicate factory towns have even been accused of human rights abuses.`
		log "Factions" "Pirates" `In poorer and more remote star systems, where the Navy seldom patrols, pirate attacks on merchant ships are frequent. Pirates are also known to attack large, unguarded convoys of freighters even in more populated areas. Most pirate fleets come from lawless worlds on the outskirts of human space, but more than a few are secretly paid privateers of the Free Worlds and Republic tasked with intercepting and stealing vessels, technology, and arms shipments of the opposing Navy.`

			`	"Was that your recruiter?"

				`	"Yeah, why?"`		
			`	"Captain Janus Griggs was *your* recruiter? Do you know how many parliamentary honors that guy has? How many service medals? He's broken his own record for campaign badges three times over, and he's turned down every one of the dozen offers he's gotten for the Admiralty because he doesn't give a damn about politics and would never leave his men in the field. That guy is a legend. You're lucky, kid."`
