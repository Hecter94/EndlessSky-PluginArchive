	description `The D94-RN-OC Shield Generator is the Republic Navy's large capital ship variant of the DR94-YV. Contrary to regenerator technology, shield overclocking increases shield recharge rate by dramatically accelerating the sweep cycle of the generator. Although this considerably hardens the shield matrix to energy and projectile impacts, the shield operates much closer to the Cherenkov Condensed Plasma Density Boundary, resulting in considerably increased heat absorption from deflected fire, exponentially increased power consumption, and the characteristic orange "light boom" of hyperspeed charged particle deceleration. As these conditions are too volatile for conventional materials, the dissapator core has been remanufactured by Lionheart Industries from a denser and costlier thermoalloy.'

Torpedoes are the most powerful homing weapon, but they move slowly enough that fast ships can simply outrun them, making them most useful against large targets or against small ships at times when they are too distracted to dodge. Torpedo launchers are also much larger than other missile systems, so they are most often found in capital ships."
