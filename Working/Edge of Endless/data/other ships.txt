	description "The Vector is a versatile utility freighter designed by Betelguese shipyards. Fast, well armed, and relatively durable compared to most similar vessels, the Vector posesses considerable outfit space and can be reconfigured in thousands of possible ways."
	description "	Able to outrun or outgun most pirates, the Vector is a coveted vessel for trading in the more...dubious ports of the galaxy, where rare and difficult-to-acquire goods are exchanged. It is rumoured that a highly modified Vector once made the Almaaz-Antares Smuggling Run in less than 12 parsecs, although this makes little sense as a parsec is a measure of distance, not time."

	description "One of the newer shipyards in the galaxy, Windfall Tradeships was established as an effort by Tradestar Corporation to diversify and vertically integrate their holdings in the lucrative shipping markets of the western Front. Seeking to replace their fragile, innefficient, and outdated Hauler and Freighter fleets with a solution better suited to the dangers of the Casper Run, Tradestar Corp contracted Zvezda Drive Yards for the design of an entirely new, spec-built, midsize frighter. By adapting prefabricated Betelguese, Tarazed, and Syndicate licensed components into a novel front-engine design, the eponymous Tradestar was born. Incredibly space efficient, highly robust, and blisteringly fast for a freighter, the Tradestar has helped increase annual net profit margin of Tradestar Corporation shipping lanes by a whopping 43.7% since the vessel's inaguaral run."

	description "As with many open-platform light freighters, the Zvezda Drive Yards Copperhead can be extensively modified and configured in countless possible ways. Converting the expansive cargo hold to make room for larger engines, power cores, cooling systems, and weapons, the Copperhead is one of the most versatile ships around and a popular choice for everything from trading to piracy to mercenary work. When purchasing aftermarket Copperheads, buyers often discover that hardly any two are ever alike, and almost none are factory-stock."

Despite its cobbled-together appearance, is a fast and formidable ship."

	description "Designed by the Syndicate as a one-ship cruiser-freighter solution for merchants transporting sensitive and valuable goods through the galaxy's more dangerous regions, the Echolon Cruiser is the closest thing the Syndicate manufactures to a Republic Battlecruiser. Always game for a bit of unscrupulous arms dealing on the side, the Syndicate quickly found that the vessel was far more popular and affordable to well-armed customers that paid in cash. Always seeking to better serve the consumer, the Syndicate migrated production of the Echolon Cruiser to the biggest off-the-books arms market in the galaxy, where the vessel gained instant popularity with the Front's countless pirates, mercenaries, guerillas, and revolutionary groups."

	description `The Lancehead Freighter is the signature vessel of Zvezda Drive Yards. Like all Zvezda craft, it is designed from largely Betelguese and Tarazed prefabricated parts, and combines impressive durability with considerable speed for a craft of its girth. Although 50-75% costlier per ton of cargo than similar freighters, the Lancehead is suited to the demands and dangers of Front trading better than any other ship in the galaxy, and those who can afford them make their money back tenfold on the lucrative trading runs of Farspace.`

	description `When Zvezda Drive Yards first drew up plans for the Lancehead Freighter, their ambition was to create the fastest, most durable modular cargo craft on the market. With so much cargo space and such large engines, it was all but inevitable that aftermarket versions would follow. Hoping to capitalize on this eventuality, Zvezda released an in-house-tuned performance variant of the Lancehead which redistributed the ship's considerable cargo space into four additional gun ports, additional length in the engine compartment, and a considerable degree of cooling for all the added systems. The modified Lancehead was immediately popular with traders and pilots on both sides of the law, although it was never quite as popular as the standard model due to its considerably higher price tag.`

	description `Betelgeuse Shipyards claims the Warbird Mechanized Heavy Cruiser is the closest thing to a Navy Cruiser the "average" civilian can buy. With the rise of the privateer and pirate clans of the Far North, Betelgeuse Shipyards has committed to providing the hired guns of the region with a complete selection of obnoxiously oversized firepower. With its four cannons, four turrets, and twin missile launchers, the private sale of heavily-automated military-grade cruisers like the Warbird are why Republic trade-in-arms laws exist, not that half the shipyards in the galaxy follow these laws.`

Simple to operate and repair, the vessel shares many components with the Leviathan and is installed with a very rudimentary set of systems for navigation and defense, cutting weight and cost and relying on the seat-of-the-pants turn-and-burn skills of the crew to get out of tight situations."

	description "The Titan Battleship is the result of a failed military procurement bid between Betelguese Shipyards and the Republic Navy. Rather than flush 2 billion credits in military R&D down the sanitary matter converter, Betelguese stripped every high-end system out of the original spec Titan and billed it as an affordable fleet-replacement flagship for mercenaries, militias, and anyone with a serious need for firepower and 80 million credits to burn. Although far less popular than smaller, more affordable models, Betelguese builds a few dozen a year, mostly for well-armed individuals who pay in cash and throw in an extra 15% to skip the mandatory militia-license background check."

Designed for guarding large convoys, defending against raids by flagship vessels, and raiding pirate systems, the Man-o-War is capable of challenging much larger vessels head-on with its considerable armament and shielding. Slow by Megaparsec standards, the vessel makes up for its lack of speed and manueverability with heavy armor plating and a ludicrous amount of firepower."

	description "The Lionheart Dromedarian Battlecruiser is the last of the great city-ships, a design hearkening back to the early days of space colonization when a long-distance vessel needed to be a self-contained world, able to survive for weeks at a time without encountering an inhabited planet. It is not only a freighter, but a carrier, and a capable warship either at short range or at a distance. Naturally, this versatility also makes it extremely expensive, and the Bactrian is not normally for sale to ordinary citizens who have not been vetted by the local government of the Deep."
