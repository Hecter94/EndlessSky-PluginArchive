	description "The Ilythiiri, known to humans as simply "Hylian Artifacts" are the enforcers of Hylian supremacy. Built from the captured core of a dying star, the Ilythiiri bestows nearly god-like powers to those who possess them. Capable of unleashing the power of a small sun in a jagged beam of pure energy, the Artifact is also some sort of jump drive, allowing Hylian warships to travel through the galaxy outside of hyperspace lanes. In Hylian culture, the Ilythiiri is worshipped as the primary god in their religion, and is believed to be sentient, each fragment of the sacred crystal a drop of the goddess Ilythiira's crystallized blood."
