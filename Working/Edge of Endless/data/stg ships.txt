	description `The Republic Battlecruiser is the pride of the Republic fleet. Often used as a staging area for ground operations, the Battlecruiser typically carries a full Battalion of Republic Marines or Navy Intelligence Special Forces (NISF) in addition to pilots and crew. Nearly twice the size of the Carrier, the Battlecruiser is the Republic's tactical anchor in prolonged direct-combat engagements, able to maintain a steady stream of firepower from its twelve turrets and six fixed guns. Housing a sizable complement of drones and fighters, the Battlecruiser also provides state-of-the-art guided munitions deterrence via the Heavy-Radiation-Environment Tactical Intercept Countermeasure Computer (HRETICC). Designed by Navy Engineers to withstand a direct hit from a nuclear weapon, the Republic Battlecruiser is truly a force to be reckoned with.`

	description "The Starfighter Advanced Combat Fighter (ACF) is a heavily modified and reinforced version of the standard Starfighter used by the Republic Navy Special Tactics Groups. Recruited on the basis of flight aptitude, bravery, and in some cases, downright foolhardiness, each STG specializes in a particular brand of fighter warfare, and both the loadouts and paint jobs of their fighters are as unique and unorthodox as their tactics."
