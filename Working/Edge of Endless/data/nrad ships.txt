	description `The Stealth Corvette is a highly advanced variant of the Destroyer, primarily used by NISF teams during black operations. Although the craft is armed with the sophisticated SCRAM-X cluster weapon, the hyperdrive, engines, and integrated cloaking of the Stealth Corvette are among the most advanced of human design. The ship incorporates a sophisticated jamming computer and runs at lower-than-baseline temperature, rendering radar-tracking and heat-seeking missiles effectively useless, and is fitted with a self-destruct mechanism in the event of capture."

	description "The Stealth Lance is the result of considerable investment by Navy Research and Development into developing a combat-effective stealth fighter. Limited by the small chassis of the Lance-type hull, the Stealth Lance is outfitted with a single beam laser, an integrated cloaking system, and an NRAD chassis-integrated experimental active-phase shield generator. Although lacking in hull robustness and shield capacity by comparison, the Stealth Lance is also faster and more maneuverable than standard Lance.
