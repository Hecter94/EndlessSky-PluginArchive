	description `A legend in its own right, the Constellation I Battlecruiser was the first private security Battlecruiser ever built. First constructed in the 2960s, the Constellation I was based on the Centennial, at that time the largest civilian transport ever constructed. Adding heavy armor, more robust engines and power, twin heavy guns, and an array of turrets, the original Constellation I sported 16 double blaster turrets and HI-TAC artillery, at that time the heaviest ordinance ever put on a commercial vessel. This model was retrofitted in the past decade with more modern weaponry.`

	description `Almost as soon as the Constellation I was completed, it became clear that its design was inherently flawed. Built on the frame of a transport, the Constellation I was sturdy enough for guarding convoys, but when faced with the prospect of direct engagement with a true warship, the original Constellation never stood a chance. Its successor, designed and built from scratch on profits of the first Constellation, became the anchor of what is now known as the Tycho Colonial Militia, a corporate peacekeeping force encompassing over half the Frontier. With a novel new variation of the plasma cannon and an entirely new state-of-the-art fusion reactor, original-spec Constellation IIs are still in service today, protecting merchants and preserving the peace.`

	description `Through the first two generations of the Constellation Battlecruiser, the composition of the Tycho Corporate Defense Fleet had always consisted of cruisers, gunships, and interceptors; until the introduction of the Constellation III, no fighters or fighter-carriers had ever been built by Tycho. With the design of the Corsa, however, a version of the Constellation was built to house four standard-size fightercraft, becoming henceforth known as the Constellation III. Along with adding fighter capacity, additional improvements in shielding, hull integrity, and power kept the Constellation series ahead of the curve and highly capable of defending the interests of Tycho Corporation.`

	description `The Constellation IV Battlecruiser is the newest, fastest, and most well-armed generation of the Constellation yet. State-of-the-art in almost every concievable way, the four-series is said to be vastly superior in design to even the best Republic ships, and capable of holding its own in direct combat against nearly any known warship. A groundbreaking capital ship with an equally groundbreaking price tag, the four-series is only available to the Tycho Corporate Militia and a few highly-regarded allies of Tycho Corporation.`

	description `After development of the third generation Constellation Battlecruiser, it became clear that Tycho's capital ship development was moving in two distinct directions: direct combat battlecruisers and ranged-engagement fighter-carriers. Rather than deciding between the two, Tycho decided to expand production into the fighter-carrier market and design an entirely new line of vessel derived from the Constellation III. Within a decade, the Ketos was born, and serves to this day as the primary fighter-carrier of the Tycho Corporate Militia.`

	description `Tycho's original effort at entering the warship market, the Centurion has been in production almost as long as Tycho has been building ships, predating the Constellation by nearly two decades. Fast, well-armed, and well-armored, the Centurion was state-of-the-art at its introduction and remains popular among many walks of life in the Frontier. Seeing continued use in a broad variety of roles, the Centurion fills almost any role, from low-profile smuggling, to escorting freighter convoys, to raiding them.`

	description `As the Countach goes, there are generally agreed to be three versions: Countach I "the fast one", Countach II (Elite) "the shiny one", and the typical modified model "the one with lots of guns." In the past few years, Tycho Research has developed a fourth model, and this time when the accountants balked at the sale price, they just fired the accountants. Arguably the fastest midsize ship ever built, the Countach III "the absurdly fast, stupidly expensive one" is a craft that few can afford, or even fly, for that matter. But Tycho, being Tycho of course, built it anyway.`

	description "The Corsair is generally agreed upon to be the more sensible midsize warship built by Tycho Shipyards. Smaller, slower, more affordable, more versatile, and appealing to a much wider audience than massive warships like the Constellation or engine-screaming 15-g nightmares like the Countach, the Corsair is durable, dependable, and popular with a broad variety of customers, from smugglers to traders."

	description "With such popularity and versatility, the Corsair is inevitably the perfect ship for the aftermarket enthusiast, and numerous aftermarket trim packages, engine mods, weapons upgrades, and tuning configurations. This one, obviously belonging to a pirate, has been absolutely stuffed with weaponry and engine mods; fitted with oversize missile pods, particle cannons, and a set of high-output plasma engines hot-running enough to require a custom hydrogen cooling system."

	description "The most popular defense craft in farspace, the Condor is a Tycho classic. Heavier than its competitors, the Condor keeps up in pursuits with an uncharacteristically beefy set of engines for an interceptor, paired with generous cargo space and two Deep-Sky Electron Beams. One of the costliest interceptors available, it'll also last twice as long as anything else on the market, with a time-honored design that's been the same for nearly half a century."

	description "The Corsa is the smallest craft made by Tycho Shipyards. Built around a single Monolithic Cannon, the Corsa is fitted with an extremely efficient coaxial-barrel cooling system that vents heat from the weapons and engines through the wings and ailerons of the craft. Expensive for a fighter, but durable and formidable in combat, the Corsa is used almost exclusively by the Tycho Corporate Militia."
