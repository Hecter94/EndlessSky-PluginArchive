	description "Classified as an interceptor rather than a fighter because it has its own hyperdrive instead of needing to be carried inside a larger ship, the Tarazed Sparrow is the smallest and cheapest combat ship available. Because of its limited cargo and passenger space, the primary way for a Sparrow pilot to pay the bills is by hunting pirates... or by becoming one. In either case, it is a perilous way to earn a living."
	description "	Insurance reports indicate that as many as two out of every three first-time ship buyers who choose to pilot a Sparrow lose their ship (and often, their life as well) within the first month of owning it."

Due to its considerable size and expense, most caravans are propoerty of large trading corporations, but a few are flown by private owners, mostly large pirate gangs cunning and well-organized enough to steal them."

Due to its considerable size and expense, the Bastillion is a rarity outside the Free Navy, but a few particularly industrious pirates and extremely wealthly traders use the mammoth vessel as a flagship."

	description "The flagship of the Free Navy, the Juggernought Battleship is the largest and newest warship built by the Coalition of Free Worlds. The latest stage in a seemingly neverending arms race between Free and Republic forces, the Juggernought is designed to challenge even a Republic Battleship in direct combat if necessary. Taking an alternative tact to the slow, heavy, and expensive operational versatility offered the Battleship's design, the designers of the Juggernought kept costs low and the vessel lighter and more manueverable by specializing the design into several different variants; for approximately the price of one all-in-one Battleship, two Juggernoughts can be constructed, each one configured uniquely for a particular combat role."
	description "	This model of the Juggernaut is outfitted in CQB Battleship configuration; heavily armed for close combat with no onboard fighter support and few ranged weapons, but capable of obliterating almost any adversary in close quarters."

	description "The flagship of the Free Navy, the Juggernought Battleship is the largest and newest warship built by the Coalition of Free Worlds. The latest stage in a seemingly neverending arms race between Free and Republic forces, the Juggernought is designed to challenge even a Republic Battleship in direct combat if necessary. Taking an alternative tact to the slow, heavy, and expensive operational versatility offered the Battleship's design, the designers of the Juggernought kept costs low and the vessel lighter and more manueverable by specializing the design into several different variants; for approximately the price of one all-in-one Battleship, two Juggernoughts can be constructed, each one configured uniquely for a particular combat role."
	description "	This model of the Juggernaut is outfitted in CQB Battleship configuration; heavily armed for close combat with no onboard fighter support and few ranged weapons, but capable of obliterating almost any adversary in close quarters."
