	description `An ancient weapon of a bygone era, the artillery cannon is still equipped to large mercenary or militia capital ships due to its cheap, simple, and brutally effective design. Able to engage large targets from a distance, artillery tears through hull with massive amounts of kinetic energy; however, as a conventional projectile weapon, its effect on shields is marginal at best. Using relatively little power compared to equivalent energy weapons, the artillery cannon relies on ignition and forced expansion of deuterium hyperspace fuel as a propellant.`
