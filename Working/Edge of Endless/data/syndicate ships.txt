	description "Designed by the Syndicate as a one-ship cruiser-freighter solution for merchants transporting sensitive and valuable goods through the galaxy's more dangerous regions, the Echelon Armored Freighter-Cruiser is the closest thing the Syndicate manufactures to a Republic Battlecruiser. Always game for a bit of unscrupulous arms dealing on the side, the Syndicate quickly found that the vessel was far more popular and affordable to well-armed customers that paid in cash. Always seeking to better serve the consumer, the Syndicate migrated production of the Echolon Cruiser to the biggest off-the-books arms market in the galaxy, where the vessel gained instant popularity with the Front's countless pirates, mercenaries, guerillas, and revolutionary groups."

	description "With 14 meter bulkheads, it is said that the molybdenum-neodymium armor plating on the exterior of the Phalanx is the heaviest ever put on a security vessel. The largest vessel built by the Syndicate, the Phalanx Armored Security Cruiser is the premier corporate security vessel in the galaxy. Brought into service after a large fleet of pirate debtors defaulted on some sizable warship loans and proved...resistant...to the large corporate fleet sent to repossess them, the Phalanx is the flagship of the Syndicate Security Fleet. Generally used as a mobile defense platform and armored superfreighter for extremely sensitive cargo and valuable assets, the Phalanx is widely known for transporting massive stores of gold, platinum, and diamonds between the Galactic Reserve on Geminus and the Galactic Stock Exchange on Martini. Immensely powerful, but prohibitively expensive to build and maintain, a small handful of Phalanxes have been built for select non-Syndicate customers who are well-connected within Syndicate bureaucracy, but the vessel is otherwise unavailable to to general public."
