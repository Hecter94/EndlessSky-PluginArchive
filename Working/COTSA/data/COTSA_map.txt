planet Albondiel
	landscape land/fog5
	description `Albondiel is the home planet of the Reluvethel, and therefore the capital of the imperialist Daeroris faction. While this world is a tad too hot for you, the Reluvethel are, obviously, adapted perfectly to the climate, consdiering the fact that they evolved on it.`
	description `	The most prominent settlement on the planet is the one which contains the imperial palace; enclosed by a pentagon of what appear to be hand-built stone walls, you cannot see beyond the gates at all. As you were flying in to land, a pair of Daeroris interceptors rather pointedly dissuaded you from flying too close to the palace. `
	spaceport `The spaceport is one of unforgiving concrete; you feel completely out of place. The Reluvethel, it seems, are oddly humanoid; in fact, the only prominent differences you can discern are that they are slightly taller than most humans, and that some of them have a pair of horns curling out of their foreheads. While they are clearly not related genetically to humanity, the similarities are somewhat disturbing.`

planet "Anhaern Permenor"
	landscape land/valley10-sfiera
	description `Anhaern Permenor is one of the older Faebalar worlds. While it was settled a century or two after Tarathiel, the same feelings of discontent with the Daeroris government ran through the vast majority of the population. A few decades after the revolution, the Daeroris officials assigned to this world are now rotting at the bottom of the sea. While Anhaern Permenor is not the leader of the Faebalar movement, it is by far one of the most fiery member worlds in the fight against the Daeroris.`
	description `	Towards the colder end of the system's habitable zone, Anhaern Permenor is just about the right temperature for humans to thrive, although it feels permanently like winter for the Reluvethel.`
	spaceport `Most of the spaceport is in ruins. Destroyed during the Faebalar uprising, all that remains are some burnt-out hulks. While there are plans to build a new spaceport, one without all of the disgusting splendour of Daeroris culture, it has not materialised, although many Anhaernens understand that it is due to the effort required to fight the war against the Daeroris.`

planet Collolo

	description `This is the only habitable planet in this system, and even so just barely. You notice that the gravity here is particularily weak. The soil here produces only a single type of very tall plant which can be seen all over the planet's surface. The predominent color of this planet is a tanish brown which seems very unaesthetic to your own human eyes. The natives who live here are also very tall due to the low gravity.`
	spaceport `The facilties at this space port are adequate but not as full featured as you've seen on other worlds in this part of space. There are a surprising number of aliens here, considering that you see nothing on this planet of any real value. You speculate that the people who live here must have some other reason that is not obvious to you.`

planet Crem'nee

	landscape land/lava7-sfiera
	description `The air here is good for breathing, though you can’t help but notice the odd smell that seems to permeate the entirety of this atmosphere. Though it’s registered as a safe natural compound by the computer, you can’t help but feel a little nauseated by it. Of course the natives here don’t notice it, and they seem to carry it around in stronger concentration.`
	description `	This planet seems to have all the conditions necessary for a vibrant, earth-like ecology. The gravity and temperature are moderate, and there is a fair amount of surface water, although the oceans are quite small. However, aside from a few stunted plants and lichen, there is almost no native life here. Given how skilled the Hai appear to be at terraforming other worlds, it is strange that this one has been left barren.`
	description `	The surface of this planet, when it is not obscured by dust storms, receives enough sunlight to power not only large solar farms, but solar furnaces as well, which the Hai use for manufacturing a large variety of goods. Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is a seaside facility that would be far more scenic for humans such as yourself, if it wasn't for the stench of the planet's natural atmosphere. There are many food sellers here vying for your attention but your stomach turns at the thought.`

planet Elincia
	landscape land/city2
	description `Elincia is a world almost perpetually shrouded by enormous clouds of dust. A few decades ago, a meteor impacted the planet in one of the most desertlike areas. It threw up a veil of dust which to thsi day has not cleared by any discernable amount. Despite this, the planet is still heavily populated, although it takes massive amounts of effort to shift sufficient amounts of food onto the planet surface in order to feed the inhabitants.`
	spaceport `The spaceport feels very human. With very traditional, right-angled walls, corridors, and ceilings, and even a logical layout to boot, it seems very odd- like it belongs somewhere else.`

planet Farestla
	landscape land/city9
	description `This planet houses one of the greatest cities and largest populations that you've seen thus far in this part of space. Farestla is the homeworld of the Avendri. Sprawling architecture and beautiful artworks can be seen throughout much of the planet. Ships are busy coming to and from the planet's many space centers, bring people, food, supplies, medicines, and the many other commodities need by the people of this fantastic and thriving world. Though there are not many different types of aliens here, racism has little meaning to these people and you are welcomed with the excellent hospitality you've come to expect from these people.`
	spaceport `As you set down on one the the space centers located around the planet, your admire the skyline of the city. Unlike most human cities, the layouts on this world are a paragon of order and artistic achievement. There are many places here to service your ship, and to buy outfits both strange and exotic.`

planet "Flool Station"
	landscape land/avendri_stationinterior1
	description `This station seems to have a little bit of everything, albiet everything alien. The station is very large and you observe everything from ship building facilietys to elaborate singing halls. You are barely noticed in the crowded halls of aliens. The smell of the crowd burns your nose, which seems to be more sensitive than that of other species. You observe various species, who mostly seem to stick to there group, aparently for saftey. Though fascinating, the whole prominod feels some what unsafe.`
	spaceport `This space port has one of the greatest varietys of ships you have seen in this part of space. The ships here come and go about there business, some in a manor that does not seem comprehensible by your own human standards.`

planet Follisnern
	landscape land/badlands0
	description `Follisnern is a largely wet planet full of ponds, lakes and rivers. The natives here don't seem to like the dampness any more than you do, and keep in tightly clustered communities underneath huge domes. The domes they live under are hermetically sealed though you cannot see why as the atmosphere here is breathable for yourself and apparently the natives who live here as well, who wander in and out of their structures through special hatches.`
	spaceport `The natives are friendly and welcome you into most areas of their cittie. The sections that are sealed off, however, are guarded by large aliens holding blasters. You get some aggressive looks as you pass by, and you feel no temptation to see what is behind the guarded doors. As you explore the city you pass various unusually shaped structures and witness vendors serving food in a manner that almost mirrors the way it's done on human planets.`

planet Gilaana
	landscape land/valley8
	description `This world is a paradise that would rival any seen in the republic. The climate here seems to be artificially controlled, giving the entire planet a perfect atmosphere and temperature. As you fly above the surface you observe many bird like creatures with two sets of wings, that resemble those of dragonflies seen on old earth. Setting down on the surface, you find that you could lose yourself in the rich smells of due and flows which permeate every part of the planet. There appears to be no winter on any part of the planet, the closest thing being gentle showers that appear from time to time evenly on the planet's continents.`
	spaceport `Unlike on human worlds, the population on this paradise world is quite thick. Instead of cities of glass and steal, the people here built their city centers out of the various types of native trees that grow here. There is a balance with nature that exists here, which spreads even to there spaceport. The landing pads are surrounded by splendid gardens which you can't help but admire as you set down. The people here welcome you with gracious hospitality.`

planet Katyr
	landscape land/sky9
	description `Katyr has only been settled very recently by the Faebalar- as with most of their other planets, it consists almost entirely of unexplored steppes and pristine biospheres. While there are a number of small, decentralised farming villages, most civilisation on Katyr is based around the few main equatorial cities, so placed due to the harsh winters.`
	description `	The people here are hardened warriors, for the most part, due to the frequent clashes between Daeroris and the Faebalar which occur in this sytem.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in the largest city on the planet. While you do not see many Faebalar here, the few that you do encounter are dressed in somewhat rougher clothes than the Daeroris further south- it appears that the Faebalar are a people not of indulgence, but of hard work and devotion to a greater cause.`

planet Krizane
	landscape land/badlands3
	description `The planets surface here is chared and seemlingly devoid of life, but upon closer inspection this world is teaming with it. The plants and animals of this world seem to be extremly adapted to camaphloging themselves to blend in to the native rock, which is distinctively charcoal in color. There seems to be a small gathering of civilization on the far part of planet, but most of the world has been left wild.`
	spaceport `The facilities here are far better than you originally anticipate. The aliens here have a full space center service albiet limited. You learn that the soil of this world is poorly adapted to the farming methods used by the aliens of this system. It requires that most of there food be exported to the planet. The main export of the ships leaving the center apears to be minerals of various sorts.`

planet Maescia

	description `	There are rumours that a species of treefolk populate some of the deepest areas of woodland, although these have mostly been dismissed as myths.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is in the biggest area of cleared land, almost five kilometres wide. Having seen the masses of trees from above as you were landing your ship, you feel like it's such a shame that so many of them have been cut down to make way for concrete landing areas- especially considering humanity's treatment of Earth before it achieved hyperdrive technology.`

planet Marikoth
	landscape land/snow3
	description `Marikoth is an icy planet with not much to offer any prospective settlers. However, it does have one important thing: metal deposits can be found very near to the surface. As a result, this has transformed from a blasted wasteland into a thriving hub of shipbuilding in Faebalar space.`
	description `	Marikoth's axial tilt is exactly zero- there is no seasonal change here whatsoever. However, this is good for building settlements, as it means that they do not have to worry about glaciers creeping down towards the equator every year to gnaw at the feet of cities and towns.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a structure made entirely of quadruple-glazed glass. While such a display of extravagance is usually beyond the Faebalar, it seems that they have made this one exception, a monument to the prowess of their workers in constructing warships.`
	spaceport `	The temperature is almost stiflingly hot inside, a stark contrast to the sharp air outside.`

planet Marssus

	description `The first thing you notice on this planet is the distinct texture of desserts. The wind pattern of this world blows the dunes into unique and surreal formations. With the climate of this planet being what it is, you are surprised anyone has settled here at all. There are no large bodies of water on this planet. The natives seem to get most of the water they need from huge atmosphere condensers.`
	spaceport `The space port here is less than crowded. The landing pads are simple cleared slabs lain across the sand, with a spaceport facility seemingly dug into the dessert itself. It seems that the locals here are not used to alien visitors, but, as with most planets in this part of space the people here welcome you.`

planet Mubid

	description `Almost the entirety of this planet's surface is covered in water, yet surprising enough the aliens that live here have built ingenious floating cities all throughout the planet. With the largest landmass's on this world being only a few kilometers across, the natives here seemed to have reserved the dry parts of the planets for ceremonial purpose. You are giving clear signals to stay away from land masses, but are otherwise free to observe the planet as you will.     `
	spaceport `The spaceport here is built on one of the largest floating cities. The facility, however, is so large and so stable that it is indistinguishable from land. You are very impressed by the engineering ability of the people of this world.`

planet Nuused
	landscape land/city11
	description `Nuused was one of the first planets to be colonized by these people. Buildings here are as new and as elegant as any you've seen in the region, and nothing looks old or broken down. Indeed, if not told so by the some the local population, you would have never known that this world was colonized thousands of years ago. Strangely enough, the people of this world have a strange custom of collecting exotic animals, as a sort of competition with their neighbors. Because you are an alien visitor, many approach you asking about the different creatures you've encountered on your many travels.`
	spaceport `The space ports on the planet are particularly clean and efficient. As you land your greeted by what appear to be routine inspection personnel. They assist you in finding all the facilities necessary in servicing your ship.`

planet Ozary
	landscape land/fields11-sfiera
	description `The planet here seems to be close to idyllic by your own standards. The atmosphere is clean and oxygen rich, and the wildlife is thriving. Though not untouched by it's alien residence, the population here seems to be small and environmentally responsible. You can imagine this planet being an ideal local for human tourists of the future.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is fairly basic. There is a refueling station and and establishment to service your ship, but other than that this planet has little more for you at present, except for a refreshing view and restful location.`

planet "Phink Station"
	landscape land/space1
	description `This facility seems to be largely built for manufacturing ships. As you enter the system you observe ships come to and from the station delivering minerals from other planets in the region. The shipyards on this facility seem primed and active. Oddly enough you see few warships, but mostly multipurpose vessels that seem to be the most common type used by these people. In the typical manner of the locals, they allow you to enter the facility with any security check. You take the opportunity to observe and study there shipbuilding methods.`
	spaceport `The vessels here come in a plethora of shapes and sizes. Large cargo vessels are in the process of being constructed, and you take time to observe and admire the craftsmanship of these friendly people. The scale of the ships built here are very large and easily rival anything built in human space, or by any other culture you've seen for that matter`

planet Sikdle
	landscape land/snow2
	description `Much of this world is ice covered and hardly habitable. Life here, does however, prosper. The ecosystem is strange, but follows an expected course for creatures of and ice world. Most of the animals here are large and covered in fur. Oddly enough, the plants here are also, for the most part, fur covered. It is also worth noting that the fur covered plants of this planet are far more dangerous than the more mobile creatures.`
	spaceport `This space port is the westernmost outpost for the Avendri. There people do not go much further into space than this, and the facility's here are sparse but adequate.`

planet Tarathiel
	landscape land/city9
	description `Tarathiel is the capital world of the communist Faebalar faction of Reluvethel. It is here that their centers of government are located. While for many humans, especially those from the evil capitalist Republic, communism means the degradation of their individual rights, here, the Faebalar have been able to develop a peaceful Communist society in which it is not necessary for individual rights to be restricted. As a result, the Faebalar are capable of putting all of their resources into the war against the Daeroris.`
	description `	Tarathiel has a climate very similar to Albondiel, the homeworld of the Reluvethel- in fact, it was the first exoplanet colonised by the Reluvethel as a species. However, the days are somewhat longer than on Albondiel, and the seasonal changes are far less dramatic.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is easily identifiable, a towering complex in the middle of the capital city. The stones used to build it are draped in red.`
	spaceport `	While the spaceport is surprisingly well adapted to civilians movement considering the fact that not only are the Faebalar at war, they are also a rebel faction, there is an ominously large amount of infrastructure clearly intended for military use.`

planet Teryani

	description `Teryani is a Daeroris world being continually strip mined for resources. Thankfully, though, this does not include blatant trampling over other, more basic organisms like plants- Teryani is naturally devoid of water and therefore life. `
	description `	This is a young world, and as a result, it is still very hot from the hyperactive tectonic processes within the mantle. Due to this, the Daeroris must wear special heat-retardant suits in order to survive. The same goes for you and your crew.`
	spaceport `This spaceport is, oddly, dug into the side of a mountain, with bays for ships dotted all over the surrounding valleys. From here, there is direct access to the mines, presumably to allow recently-recruited workers to be shuttled straight to their designated shaft in which they will be digging.`
	spaceport `	While the structures seem fairly strong, you are somewhat wary of the ship bays. Considering all of this planet's tectonic activity, it seems all too likely that a small shift in the rocks could crush you and your fleet...`

planet Thalia
	landscape land/mountain14-sfiera
	description `While many of Thalia's inhabitants do believe in the Daeroris government, it is a part of the Faebalar state, albeit involuntarily- when the Faebalar offered them the chance to join their movement peacefully, the planetary government refsed. As a result, one of the Faebalar's first moves was to occupy Thalia in order to prevent a Daeroris strike from being able to attack them in the heart of their own territory.`
	description `	Thalia's axial tilt is far beyond what is considered average even for the Reluvethel- as a result, the seasons vary massively. An area that may be wracked with frost on the day of the winter solstice can be tropical in temperature by the summer solstice.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is little more than a ghost town. While you do see a number of Daeroris ships here, they appear to be old, outdated models, clearly ones left over from the defence against the Faebalar invasion. Most of the other ships at the spaceport are Faebalar military vessels.`
	spaceport `	Inside the complex, there are guards at every corner and intersection- in fact, you feel more like you are at a military base than a civilian spaceport.`

	description `	Most of this world is covered by odd, freshwater seas, with a number of small archipelagos popping out of the waters all over the planet. In one of the larger clusters, near the equator, the Reluvethel Daeroris have built a network of settlements joined across the sea to each other by typical concrete bridges. This appears to be some kind of holy world to the Daeroris; almost every island has some kind of monument at its peak.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Theodluin is surprisingly extensive, sprawling itself all over a smaller island like some kind of parasitical ivy. In fact, the entire complex is somewhat maze-like; the trading halls seem to be as far away as possible from the food courts, and the arrivals and departures lounges for private individuals are ridiculously far apart.`

Indeed, you can see no industrial equipment anywhere, though the people here are obviously civilized, as you see ships going to and from the planet.`
	spaceport `The ships here seem to be very focused with collecting the harvests. Though the people here have time to talk, they seem very busy with what they're doing. You find it odd that they are not alarmed by your presence, but instead only give you curious looks and glances. All the shopkeepers and food sellers are quite cordial, and the smell of good food permeates the facility.`

	spaceport `The landing pads here are very unique structures, cut entirely out of huge sheets of ice. The platforms themselves seem to be specially treated with some outer material that creates friction and keeps the permafrost from melting at all. The residents here give you stern looks, but are mostly accepting of your presence.`
