        description `Coloradia is a dry, rugged planet named after a historical mining district from the original Earth colony. They say the mountains and volcanoes offer a powerful reminder of the forces of nature which humans initially had to overcome. Craft beer and integrated circuitboards remain common exports from this vital community.`
        spaceport `The spaceport is situated just on the other side of the Elk Mountains. One of the few thriving species, elk roam freely surrounding the spaceport offering a tranquil entry for new colonists.`
