### Coloradia

![planet-icon](images/planet/coloradia.png)

Coloradia is a dry, rugged planet named after a historical mining
district from the original Earth colony. They say the mountains
and volcanoes offer a powerful reminder of the forces of nature
which humans initially had to overcome. Craft beer and integrated
circuitboards remain common exports from this vital community.
