	description "The Breaker is primarily designed for mining, though it is quite commonly used as a small weapon. As with most Naltok technology, the designers prioritised efficiency over power, resulting in a weapon that compares unfavourably to even a human beam laser or energy blaster - particularly in its poor performance against shields."

Because of this, it is entirely computer-controlled, similar to anti-missile turrets."
