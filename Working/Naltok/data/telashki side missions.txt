			`	"Here is the situation: For many years now, we have been studying an interesting phenomenon that occurs in the Norelon system. Our name for it would translate best into your language as 'Star-Worms', but essentially they are tiny flashes of light, visible from a ship's window. We have been aware for a long time that at some point, we will have to relocate this phenomenon to another star system, as the imminent supernova in Vokegol likely poses a great threat to it."`

					goto continuing
			`	"Have none of us told you about Vokegol yet? I am not an astrophysicist, so I cannot go into much detail, but the short explanation is that the stars you see in that system are continually spiralling inwards, and when they collide they will erupt in a supernova explosion." They pause for a second, seeing your worried expression, and then continue. "Do not worry, there is no risk of anything happening in the next hundred years! This is simply a long-term plan."`
			label continuing
			`	"Anyways, before that system goes supernova, we need someone to help us transfer these Star-Worms to another system. Unfortunately, the recent war with the Xochira has made sending unarmed ships there too risky, so instead we would like to enlist your help. For now though, we just want you to visit the Norelon system and collect some simple data, checking whether the Star-Worms have any unexpected interactions with your ship, then return here."`

			`	"The Star-Worms are not really worms in the traditional sense - they are actually a complex filamentous arrangement of bacterial cells. They live in the vacuum of space, and are able to extract energy from ionised dust and gas. The most interesting thing we've learned about them is that they seem to be able to propel themselves directionally in a manner not totally dissimilar to the way ion engines work, albeit at a vastly lower specific impulse. We've noticed that they often cling to the exterior of ships, and our research has suggested that they are attracted to the shields."`
			`	"As yet, the fact that the Star-Worms can only survive in a near-total vacuum, and require the presence of small amounts of ionised matter to provide them with energy, has made it difficult to cultivate them in laboratory environments. We can study their activity, but we cannot effectively induce them to replicate on large scales, so we have been shipping them in from Norelon rather than trying to cultivate them locally."`
