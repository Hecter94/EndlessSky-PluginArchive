			`A large group of Quarg approach your ship quickly as it docks with this section of the ringworld. When you leave the ship, however, most of the Quarg pause briefly, and you notice that a small group wearing what seems like some sort of full-body armor wander off to other parts of the station.`

			`	After a few moments, one of the Quarg steps forwards, and begins speaking to you. "Welcome, human. Evidently you were able to reach here, despite the hostility the Naltok doubtless had toward you?"`

			`	"The mere fact of your 'strength' does not justify acts of bloodshed, human. You travel now amongst the systems of the Naltok, and you would do well to seek peace with them."`

				`	"Can you tell me more about the Naltok?"`
				`	"Why aren't there any Naltok here, if this is their space?"`
			`	The Quarg pauses for a moment, and you feel a sense of resignation coming from it. "The Naltok hold a deep resentment for us Quarg. Their history and culture may have prejudiced them against our nature, or their minds may have been poisoned by some other. It is not unheard of for them to visit us here, but neither is it a frequent occurrence.`
			`	"Furthermore, the arrival of humans and their creations appears to have turned the Naltok against themselves." The Quarg leans in closer to you, and its voice takes on a quieter tone before continuing. "It is our hope that you can mend this unfortunate circumstance, rather than further aggravating it."`
