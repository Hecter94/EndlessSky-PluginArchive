			`This planet is populated by a species of aliens that remind you of giant newts, slightly shorter than you and with large eyes and dark, rubbery skin. They move languidly through the spaceport, which appears to be flooded with around a foot of water, and several of them come in to watch your ship as you land.`
			`	Several of them have gathered in a crowd outside your ship's door, waiting for you to leave.`
			`	As you cautiously open your ship's hatch, the crowd of aliens opens slightly. An individual wearing a tight, dark green outfit made from some kind of plastic-like material steps forward, pauses briefly, then begins speaking to you.`
			`	"Greetings, visitor. You are human, yes?"`
			choice
				`	"Yes, I am human."`
					goto naltok
				`	"Wait, how do you know my language?"`
			`	"We have spoken to other humans, and learned from them. They spoke the same language as you, and your appearance is also human."`
			label naltok
			`	The alien steps back slightly and gestures around. "We are the Naltok. These planets are under the control of the Telashki, and we will welcome you so long as you do not cause trouble."`
			choice
				`	"Why was I attacked when I entered your space?"`
					goto xochira
				`	"If you are all Naltok, who are the Telashki?"`
			`	"My apologies, I may have explained that poorly. The Telashki are the government of this region - equivalent to your 'Republic'. Naltok is the name of our species."`
			label xochira
			`	"You must have entered our space from the south, yes? If so, you no doubt encountered the Xochira. They are xenophobes and technophobes who rejected our leadership, and now attack anyone attempting to enter or leave Naltok space. If you do not wish to face them again, you are welcome to stay here in our space. Alternatively, if you wish to leave, we are happy to sell you weapons and warships to aid you on your journey back."`
			`	As the Naltok continues talking, the crowd behind them parts to allow a taller, more humanlike individual through. As they approach, you see brief glimpses of green skin, and before you have a chance to respond you are face to face with an Alpha. She is slightly taller than you, with short hair, and is wearing waterproof trousers and a pair of rubber boots.`
			choice
				`	(Draw my weapon.)`
					goto weapon
				`	(Wait for them to act.)`
					goto waiting
				`	"Hello, what brings you here?"`
			`	The Alpha seems briefly surprised, perhaps not expecting you to strike up a conversation. "Same as you, I believe. I travelled here with a Jump Drive, then found my exit blocked by the Xochira and their 'Archerfish'. Figured I'd be better off staying here than getting myself killed trying to escape. Now that we're stuck here together, what's your name?"`
				goto name
			label waiting
			`	After a few seconds of silent stares, the Naltok begins talking with a distinct enthusiasm in a clear attempt to defuse the situation before things go downhill. "Hey, I realise we don't even know each others' names." They look back and forth expectantly between you and the Alpha.`
				goto name
			label weapon
			`	The Alpha knocks your weapon out of your hand with laughable ease, then leans in closer and whispers to you. "It doesn't surprise me that that's your initial response, but I urge you to reconsider. Right now, we're both prisoners of the Xochira, whether we like it or not. You've nothing to gain by starting a fight."`
			choice
				`	"I suppose you are right."`
					goto waiting
				`	(Return to my ship and take off)`
			`	You never moved far from the hatch of your ship, so there is no time for anyone to stop you. As you ascend through the atmosphere, your sensors note that your ship is receiving fire from small-caliber weaponry. It appears you are no longer welcome here.`
				launch
			label name
			choice
				`	"My name is <first> <last>"`
					goto tellname
				`	"I would prefer not to tell you my name."`
			`	The Alpha speaks up first. "There's no need to be so uncooperative; we truly mean you no harm. I understand that the years of propaganda you must have been subjected to back in Human space are not easy to overcome, but I must ask that you try to have an open mind. My name is Izarna."`
			`	The Naltok joins in before you can respond "My name is Choshkal."`
				goto choshkal
			label tellname
			`	The Alpha smiles. "My name is Izarna. This is Choshkal, a friend of mine from the Ministry of Alien Life. If you wish to know more, visiting the Ministry on Kutora would be a good idea."`
			label choskal
			`	Choshkal's expression changes in what you presume is the Naltok equivalent of a smile "Anyways, I would like to welcome you to our space on behalf of the Ministry of Alien Life. We hope you have a good time here, and there are probably many things you can help us with."`
			`	Choshkal says something to the onlookers in the Naltok language and the crowd disperses, leaving you free to wander the planet.`

The alien vaguely reminds you of a giant newt or salamander, with dark, rubbery skin and large eyes, and is slightly shorter than you. The water is lukewarm, and quickly washes over your lower legs.`
