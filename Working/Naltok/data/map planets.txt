	description "This planet is home to an incredible diversity of plant and fungal life, but no animal life whatsoever. The forests, plains, skies and seas alike are all perfectly still, a silence broken only by the occasional breeze."
	description "At certain times of year the wormhole is visible in the night sky, an eerie eye staring down at the silent planet below."

planet Cherexot

	landscape land/lava2
	description "For whatever reason, this earth-sized planet, located in the habitable zone of this system, has failed to retain a thick enough atmosphere to support life. Instead, it is enveloped in a thin wisp of toxic sulphur compounds, which render it totally unsuitable for any form of large-scale habitation."

planet Chexilok
	attributes naltok
	landscape land/sea5
	description "This is an unusually hot, dense ocean planet. The pressure at sea level is nearly three times that on Earth, and the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide is high enough that it is toxic. The Naltok have established massive quantities of bioengineered algae in the upper waters, which supply more than two thirds of the oil used in Naltok space."
	description "The majority of the oil produced here is used in the production of plastics, which are used extensively in Naltok furniture and appliances thanks to their excellent water resistance. The rest is used in various industrial processes."
	spaceport "The spaceport is pressurised, and carefully cooled to a more pleasant temperature. Small windows give views of the immense oceans and piercing sunlight outside, though most are covered by curtains which keep the light and heat at bay."

planet Chireke

	landscape land/forest3
	description "The environmental conditions on this planet make it almost the perfect home for the Naltok - the first explorers to land here imagined the planet superseding their homeworld as the centre of their civilisation."
	description "Unfortunately, those same conditions also make Chireke the perfect home for a wide range of incredibly fast-growing plant species, many of which can grow through metres of solid concrete with the same ease with which most plants would grow through a few centimetres of soil. Every attempt to establish major settlements here has been reduced to rubble and reclaimed by the jungle within a few months."
	spaceport "The spaceport sits atop a high mountain plateau, where the cold, dry conditions and thin air inhibit plant growth enough that permanent structures can be established. The unique flora of this planet have given rise to a fairly large lumber industry, and the railway from the mountaintop to the jungle below has become a fairly large tourist attraction as well."

planet Ganolek
	attributes naltok rural
	landscape land/fields19
	description "This highly-developed agricultural world produces enough food to feed the entire population of Telashki space, even without the assistance of the sizeable farms in the nearby systems. As a result, the farmers here have been able to trade off some efficiency for luxury, and Ganolek is now known throughout Naltok space for its delicious and unique cuisine."
	description "Beneath the surface-level farms are an entirely separate layer of subterranean farmland, with crops grown under artificial lighting which is powered by geothermal energy."
	spaceport "There are two spaceports on Ganolek, located at the poles - the only parts of the planet's surface which are unsuitable for growing crops. Below the south pole, between the spaceport and the subterranean farms, is the headquarters of the Ministry of Agriculture."
	spaceport "Most of the Naltok here are wearing thick, warm clothing, but nonetheless are more energetic than on most other planets, excitedly discussing the range of cuisine on offer."

	landscape land/forest7
	description "The large forested continents and shallow temperate ocean of this world are home to an incredible diversity of invertebrates, most of which resemble insects or crustaceans. Colossal crab-like creatures graze on the open plains, and the apex predators are pack-hunting carnivores which resemble woodlice but are as large as horses." 

planet Joklanok
	attributes factory naltok urban
	landscape land/city14-sfiera
	description "Joklanok is home to several landmasses with ideal conditions to support large cities. It is also home to a colossal desert continent which spans most of the equator, and which frequently fills the atmosphere with catastrophic and unpredictable sandstorms which can often reach all the way to the poles."
	description "To combat the wear from the sandstorms the Naltok built enormous, sloped buildings from the same mineralising bacterial communities used in their ships. In addition to resisting the sandstorms, the largest city here also famously survived an asteroid impact - after evacuating the whole city, the residents were surprised to see that within a few weeks the buildings had recovered completely."
	spaceport `The primary spaceport here was originally a temporary port built to facilitate evacuation in preparation for the asteroid strike. Having been both larger and more streamlined than the original port, the "Evacuation Port" was expanded and refurbished by the Ministry of Transport and is now widely considered to be the most pleasant spaceport anywhere in Naltok space.`

Since then, they have shifted to using biological processes to filter out deuterium from seawater, and as a result this planet is now largely left alone."

	landscape land/snow13
	description "Based on its position, this tiny moon should be no more than an uninhabitable ball of ice and rock. Instead, its surface is warmed to only a few degrees below freezing by the decay of the abnormally high portion of radioisotopes present in its crust."
	description "As such, while the lack of sunlight makes Kevoshek unsuited for large-scale colonisation, it is home to massive automatic mining facilities harvesting material for use in the Naltok reactors and radioisotopic generators."
	spaceport "The spaceport here, like the mining operations, is entirely automatic - the radiation makes long-term habitation unsafe. Mechanical attendants and computer terminals greet you and the Naltok freight captains looking for well-paid transport jobs to other planets."

planet Kolxacha

	description "This planet serves as the defensive line of the Telashki. Its proximity to their major industrial worlds is both a blessing and a curse - while it is easy to keep the fleets here supplied, those planets would be under direct attack if the defenses here ever failed. It is for this reason, rather than any other, that this minimally habitable planet has become such a bustling centre of activity."
	spaceport "The sheer number of warships here is disturbing. While this part of the spaceport is primarily for incoming shipments of materials, you were able to see the vast defensive fleet stationed on this planet as you flew in to land. An enormous docked fleet that stretches as far as the eye can see is stationed here, every ship ready to take off and engage an enemy at the first sign of danger."

	landscape land/station33
	description "This Quarg ringworld is roughly half complete, the result of more than five millenia of work. Construction here began at around the same time as work began on the Great Pyramids of Egypt back on Earth, and continued throughout the rise and fall of Babylon, Greece, Rome and countless other human civilisations - a testament to the stability and persistence of the Quarg and their society."
	description "Other than the extension of the backbone of the ring, it appears that much of the work being carried out here is centred around establishing hydroponic farms and the other infrastructure required to allow the ring to support permanent habitation."
	spaceport "The spaceport is bustling with activity, but almost all of it is directly connected to the construction work here. Whole areas are almost unused, but still staffed, while passing through a single door or even walking across a room often leaves you in the middle of a dense crowd of Quarg, many of them Skylark crew and captains looking for their next cargo assignment."
	spaceport "The few Naltok who have decided to spend some time here despite the absence of the pools of water favoured in their own buildings greet you as you pass through, but neither you nor they are inclined to stay for longer than you have to."

	description "In addition to being a fairly large population center, this world is also the home of the Ministry of Alien Life. The location close to the Quarg ringworld allows the Ministry to easily monitor Quarg activity in the neighboring system, though the original intent was to facilitate interspecies cooperation."
	spaceport "Large parts of the spaceport are designed to mimic Quarg architecture, with high ceilings and smooth, meticulously cleaned panels. There is ongoing work on creating a section inspired by human architecture, although the sections that have been completed so far feel distinctly uncanny."

	description "The many separated oceans of Legash are both unusually deep and unusually narrow, as if they were enormous scars on the planet's surface filled with water, and as a result are home to an incredible diversity of animal life."
	description "This planet is home to the headquarters of the Ministry of Genetic Research, viewed by many as the most prestigious of all the Telashki ministries. Carefully planned terraforming operations have transformed much of the land into idyllic (by Naltok standards) swamps and marshes, and the Ministry building with its immediately recognisable double helix motif is visible for hundreds of miles across the flat and mostly empty land."
	spaceport "The spaceport is located near the base of the Ministry building, and also seems to serve as some kind of visitor centre or museum. Plaques, sculptures and posters display the history of the Ministry and its many accomplishments, from its initial founding over five thousand years ago to the present day."

Unfortunately, none of those landmasses exists for more than a few hours at a time. The enormous tides here reveal and submerge vast tracts of land several times a day, making the planet unsuitable for large-scale colonisation, either in traditional cities or large vessels."
	description "The only inhabitants of this planet are small fishing communities, using smaller vessels and keeping to deeper water to avoid being stranded when the tides go out."

planet Nareltok

	description "Nareltok is the home planet of the Naltok, a cool, damp world which is mostly covered in shallow seas and marshy landmasses. Huge cities with spectacular towering buildings are scattered around the landscape, and most of their surroundings appear to be agricultural land - only a few small areas of unspoilt countryside remain."
	description "Though at first glance the cities and the remaining marshlands seem vibrant and lively, a closer inspection reveals the scars of the ecological collapse and nuclear war that almost drove the Naltok to extinction. The Naltok may have recovered, but it will be a long time before their homeworld can be said to have done the same."
	spaceport "A surprising number of buildings here are in various states of abandonment and dereliction. Between the disasters that struck the pre-spacefaring Naltok and the mass push for the stars once civilisation here had recovered, the population has never quite returned to its peak levels, and is currently less than a third the size of Earth's."

	spaceport `The spaceport here, like many Naltok buildings, is filled with about a foot of lukewarm water. For the Naltok this is essential, in order to prevent their skin from drying out in the air, but for humans and any other visitors this is inconvenient and highly unpleasant. Unlike many other Naltok buildings however, this building has "Visitor paths" which are almost entirely dry, allowing humans and alphas to traverse most of the spaceport in comfort.`

Almost all of the land on this ocean planet is taken up by huge spaceports for landing, repairing and rearming ships and by munitions depots."
	description "Before the rebellion of the Xochira, this was the headquarters of the Ministry of War. Their disorganised movement to the north following a rout at the hands of the Grand Admiral and his fleet was instrumental in delaying any Telashki counterattack."
	spaceport "The spaceport is clearly built for military purposes, as are the many others on this planet.

With the outbreak of the current civil war, Xutajol's distance from the frontline with the Xochira became another boon for the battle-weary crews of the Alpha ships. By mutual agreement and with the help of their Human visitors, the Naltok here have also begun manufacturing some simple equipment to Human designs."
