			"Minnow drones are brilliant for mining - or at least, they would be if they had asteroid scanners. As it is, they have to be directed from their mothership - at that point, why are they even drones?"
			"Top tip from a veteran: if you strip down the weapons and shields on a Piranha, you can fit a surprising amount of cargo or bunk space in there."
			"I'm never going to try landing a Flounder again."
			"There's a lot of potential money to be made running commodities back and forth across the frontlines, but I'm not willing to risk trying."
			"Have you seen the railway on Chireke? If you haven't, it's worth a visit. You'll probably be able to find a job hauling lumber once you're there, so the trip will pay for itself!"

		"A monitor suddenly lights up and begins displaying several extremely detailed pictures of a bacterial cell, accompanied by labels in the Naltok language. Before you have time to get a good look, a group of excited scientists pushes you aside and congregates around the screen."
		`A regular broadcast is interrupted by some "Breaking News" about a newly discovered bacterial species. Despite the translation provided, most of the discussion is so complicated that you are unable to make out anything but the most basic details.`
		"A small window opens up in the corner of a monitor, displaying a video feed of the Vokegol system for a few minutes before dissapearing again."
		"A short bulletin from the Ministry of ${telashki: ministries} briefly summarises several recent minor discoveries, acompanied by instructions on where to look for a more detailed account."

		"It amazes me that Humans and Naltok share the same amino acids, DNA bases and translational apparatus! It's a shame we've never managed to get a DNA sample from a Quarg."
		"Have you seen the Star-Worms of Norelon? They're beautiful to watch, but they can be a real headache if they get onto a planet with the right surface conditions."
		"I wonder if there's alien life out there? Besides you, obviously. And the Quarg. And the Alphas. And the Star-Worms, I suppose. Okay, now I think about it there's probably quite a lot."
		"I wish the Quarg were more cooperative. They clearly know so much that we don't, but they've never been willing to share."
		"My transgenic bacterial samples grew 233% more rapidly on average than the control group! That's an improvement of 0.43% over the last batch!"
		"Would you be willing to bring me some soil samples from your homeworld? I'm studying the connections between soil microbiomes and physiological features of sentient species."
		"The bacteria in Naltok starship hulls actually combine enzymes isolated from species from four different planets, as well as many totally artificial designs."
		"Metallurgy? It's an interesting subject, but quite dated. If you ask me, the major advances of this milennium will be in xenobiology."
		"I'm technically supposed to be at work right now, but there isn't much I can do until my current experiment finishes running."

		"A screen displays a stylised portrayal of an Archerfish facing off against a Falcon and two Tetra, accompanied by upbeat music. Several Naltok children and a couple of adults cheer as the Falcon is destroyed in a simple block-colour explosion."
