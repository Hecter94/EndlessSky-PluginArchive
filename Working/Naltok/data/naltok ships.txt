	description `The Mackerel is a fairly unremarkable mid-range transport vessel, decently mobile and with adequate passenger space. What sets apart the Mackerel, and the reason it is such a popular and well-known ship among the Naltok, is its history.`
	description `	In the early days of the war, many Naltok civilians on both sides found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the frontline or separated from their friends and family. Merchant captains saw the opportunity this presented and, with implicit approval from both of the warring governments, rallied a fleet of Mackerel transport vessels to ferry citizens to their desired side of the boundary.`

	description `With its spacious interior, varied recreational spaces and the huge swimming pool that runs most of its length, many would likely assume the Marlin was a Naltok equivalent to the Star Queen or some other luxury liner. Instead, the Marlin is used exclusively by the Ministry of Transport, which operates a vast fleet of Marlin liners as a public transit network, providing efficient and comfortable movement between systems.`

	description `A popular joke among the Naltok is that all their ships are named for fish, but only the Flounder flies like one. The handling of the Flounder is so legendarily bad that the latest model has been designed to carry two Minnow drones - not for mining, but because waiting for the drones to ferry cargo up and down through the atmosphere is generally agreed to be a preferable alternative to attempting to land the Flounder in a spaceport.`
	description `	For any pilots willing to endure its disastrous mobility and the unique challenge of landing it, the Flounder does offer a spectacular cargo capacity, much larger than any human freighter.`

Their weapon designers quickly produced the Leech-Ray in an attempt to prevent any Alpha ships escaping to the Telashki, but no ships they produced at the time were fast enough to chase a potential opponent down without risking their escape.`
	description `	Several designs were proposed, but ultimately the Xochira opted to begin constructing the Archerfish; a low-cost, high-speed light warship carrying two Leech-Rays.

More than half of the space is devoted to the rows of missile launchers that run along both sides of the ship, and almost all of the remainder is devoted to the engines.`

	description `The Albacore is not intended to be involved in large fleet battles like the Kaluga, but instead to serve as a transporter and deployer for five Lamprey fighters, patrolling the systems previously covered by the Archerfish. Despite this, the Albacore is not completely unarmed, carrying a small armament intended for long-range support, bringing some additional firepower to bear against ships trapped by the Lampreys.`

	description `The Moray is a high-performance medium warship, with impressive armament and toughness for its size. Unfortunately, this combat power comes at the cost of fairly poor mobility - the Moray is one of the slowest ships the Naltok produce, though this disadvantage is lessened somewhat by the turret-heavy armament and single rear-facing missile launcher, both of which make the Moray less vulnerable to flanking attacks.`

	description `Inspired by the Telashki Remora, the Lamprey is the Xochira take on a small, fast carried ship. Extending the concept behind the Archerfish, the Lamprey's defining features are its excellent top speed and its armament consisting entirely of a single Leech-Ray. Though not a true spinal mount, the Leech-Ray is still responsible for more than a quarter of the craft's mass, and the oversized housing for it creates some challenges on the rare occasions that a Lamprey needs to land on a planet.`
