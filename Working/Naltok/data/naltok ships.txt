	description `The Mackerel is a fairly unremarkable mid-range transport vessel, decently mobile and with adequate passenger space. What sets apart the Mackerel, and the reason it is such a popular and well-known ship among the Naltok, is its history.`
	description `In the early days of the war, many Naltok civilians on both sides found themselves stranded on the wrong side of the frontline or separated from their friends and family. Merchant captains saw the opportunity this presented and, with implicit approval from both of the warring governments, rallied a fleet of Mackerel transport vessels to ferry citizens to their desired side of the boundary.`

The handling of the Flounder is so legendarily bad that the latest model has been designed to carry two Minnow drones, because waiting for the drones to ferry cargo up and down through the atmosphere is generally agreed to be a preferable alternative to attempting to land the Flounder in a spaceport.`
	description `For any pilots willing to endure its disastrous mobility, the Flounder does offer a spectacular cargo capacity, far larger than any human freighter.`

Their weapon designers quickly produced the Leech-Ray in an attempt to prevent any Alpha ships escaping to the Telashki, but no ships they produced at the time were fast enough to chase a potential opponent down without risking their escape.`
	description `Several designs were proposed, but ultimately the Xochira opted to begin constructing the Archerfish; a low-cost, high-speed light warship carrying two Leech-Rays. To date, the Xochira maintain that no Alpha warship has ever escaped the Archerfish long enough to escape to Telashki space.`

Rather than metals, Naltok ships are built from a community of mineralising bacteria grown onto an inert frame. This allows them to continually repair themselves in combat, but comes at the cost of a substantially higher mass and limits the effectiveness of their shield projectors.`

	description `The Moray is a high-performance medium warship, with impressive armament and toughness for its size. Unfortunately, this combat power comes at the cost of fairly poor mobility - the Moray is one of the slowest ships the Naltok produce, though this disadvantage is lessened by the turret-heavy armament and single rear-facing missile launcher, which make the Moray less vulnerable to flanking attacks.`
