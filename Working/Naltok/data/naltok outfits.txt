	description "This tiny bioelectric cell would struggle to power all but the smallest human outfits, but is often adequate for the highly efficient Naltok equipment in their smaller ships."

	"outfit space" -32
	"energy generation" 3.15
	"heat generation" 1.2
	description "This is the largest bioelectric cell the Naltok use in their ships. Although it is both more powerful and more efficient than human fuel cell technology, it compares far less favourably to radioisotopic and nuclear generators. As such, bioelectric cells are only used in relatively small Naltok ships."

	"mass" 59
	"outfit space" -59
	"energy generation" 7.15
	"heat generation" 3.55
	description "Naltok radioisotopic generators use a two-stage system, with direct electrical energy harnessing followed by a secondary system that reclaims some additional energy from the waste heat produced. The resulting generator is rather bulky for its energy output, but it only loses a relatively small amount of heat to the rest of the ship."

	"energy generation" 16.55
	"heat generation" 8.6
	description "The Naltok prefer not to use fusion reactors on their ships, opting instead for these highly efficient fission reactors. While the resulting generators are less powerful than human fusion technology, they produce vastly less heat."

	"energy generation" 23.3
	"heat generation" 12.3
	description "This enormous fission reactor, far larger than most human reactors, is only used on the very largest of Naltok ships. This is partially because Naltok technology rarely requires this much power, but primarily because the heat output, though relatively low by the standards of most other races, is enough to cause major problems for all but the largest of Naltok ships."

	"energy generation" .65
	"solar collection" .65
	"heat generation" .45
	description "This is a biophotovoltaic system, a modification of the Spring Cell which allows some harnessing of incoming sunlight. The additional energy provided by the sunlight makes this more powerful than standard biovoltaics in theory, but around the dim stars of the galactic rim this advantage is far less clear-cut, and as a result most Naltok opt for the more reliable bioelectrics."

	description "These large biophotovoltaic systems never became popular in Naltok space, but perhaps you can find some use for them in the brighter parts of the galaxy."

	"mass" 23
	"outfit space" -23
	"shield generation" .375
	"shield energy" .125
	description "Because shields are not their ships' primary form of protection, the Naltok have focused on making their generators more energy-efficient rather than more powerful. As a result, this generator is not much more powerful than its human equivalent, but uses only a fraction of the energy while generating."

	"shield generation" .975
	"shield energy" .325
	description "The larger shield generators produced by humanity are slightly more powerful than this shield generator, despite millenia of Naltok technological advances. However, no human shield generator even approaches this device's energy efficiency."

	"heat generation" 1.25
	description "For a long time, the Naltok have employed genetically engineered bacteria as a means of separating out the deuterium required for hyperspace travel from hydrogen supplies. With the advent of the Xochira's fearsome Leech-Ray, the Telashki have begun producing this ship-borne equivalent, which is able to continually supply a ship with small amounts of hyperspace fuel."

	description "Naltok batteries are bulky and not particularly effective. The best that can be said about them is that the Naltok, evidently realising this, make them available at a very low price."

	description "Despite the general technological edge the Naltok have over humanity, their batteries are surprisingly primitive by human standards - this one is larger than the human equivalent, but also stores less energy."

	description "This large scanner is able to scan and analyse almost any material, and is commonly used by Telashki surveillance ships to monitor merchants, asteroids and planetary weather."
	description "Although the design predates the split between the Xochira and Telashki by several centuries, the Xochira rarely produce or stock these scanners, only using them to assist with asteroid mining."

	"flare sound" "ion small"
	description "The lead engineer who designed the latest model of these thrusters spent months searching for new ways to reduce their power consumption and minimise the loss of energy as heat. According to a popular story, she was only satisfied when the engines were no hotter to the touch during a test run than the stone floor of the warehouse they were being stored in."

	description "Even the Quarg look at Naltok engines with a begrudging admiration for their spectacular efficiency, and the underwhelming thrust of those same engines gives them plenty of time to do so."

	"flare sprite" "effect/naltok flare/large"
		"frame rate" 0.9
	"flare sound" "ion large"
	description "At their core the engines produced by the Ministry of Transport are ion engines not unlike those produced by the Syndicate. What sets the Naltok thrusters apart is the work generations of engineers have put into minimising their power requirements by any means available to them, which has resulted in efficiency unmatched almost anywhere in the galaxy."

		"frame rate" 0.8
	"flare sound" "ion huge"
	description "Compared to the largest human thrusters, the Monitor is relatively small, but it nonetheless provides a reasonable amount of thrust. Where the Monitor shines is its efficiency, which massively eclipses any comparable human technology."

	"steering flare sound" "ion tiny"
	description "This tiny steering system sees frequent use on the smallest Naltok ships, but it is also used by pilots attempting to cram just a little bit more steering power onto their ship. Unlike a comparable plasma or atomic engine one might encounter in human space, the addition of this Naltok steering system will almost never require additional power or cooling to compensate."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/naltok flare/small"
		"frame rate" 1.1
	"steering flare sound" "ion small"
	description "Unlike most, the Naltok typically build their steering systems larger than the corresponding thrusters. There are probably many reasons for this, but a notable one is their apparent refusal to use reverse thrusters."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/naltok flare/medium"
		"frame rate" 1.0
	"steering flare sound" "ion medium"
	description "The Naltok pride themselves on the efficiency of their technology. Whereas a human engineer might try to improve the force offered by this steering system, or perhaps seek to make it smaller, the engineers of the Ministry of Transport have instead focused on trying to allow it to run on as little energy as possible."

	"steering flare sprite" "effect/naltok flare/large"
		"frame rate" 0.9
	"steering flare sound" "ion large"
	description "A steering system this large would probably only see use on the largest ships in human space, but the Naltok will often cram it onto substantially smaller ships, even if that means sacrificing some top speed. The fact that only a relatively small generator and typically no cooling systems at all are required to operate it is perhaps as much of a factor in this as the unexplained Naltok fondness for tight cornering on their vessels."

Fortunately, rather than employing bioengineered pathogens, they appear to prefer weapons like this - a medium-sized synthetic organism which can be easily carried and which spews a spray of deadly acid if disturbed."
	description "While laws regulating the use of biological weapons were not written with anything like the Acid Grub in mind, most non-Naltok governments will cite the excessive suffering of the victims as reason enough to fine you severely for posessing one."
