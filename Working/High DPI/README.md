# endless-sky-high-dpi

This is a collection of double-resolution sprites for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky). To make use of these sprites, copy this folder into one of the two [plugins folders](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/wiki/CreatingPlugins). These sprites will only be used if:

  * you have set the "zoom factor" to higher than 100% in the preferences, or
  * you have a high-DPI monitor.

High-DPI mode has only been tested on Mac OS X.
