			`	You approach the coordinates given to you by the mysterious man. When you get close enough you see something strange in one of the many craters of Luna. When you get closer you see a gate of sorts starting to de cloak. You can also see a bunch of turrets de cloaking near the gate. It looks like this place is very heavily armed. You then receive a message telling you to enter the gate and land. You then proceed to enter.`
			`	Inside the gate is a large base. There is a large landing area for multiple large ships. There are also fighter jets parked in the landing area. The landing area is separated from the rest of the base by what you think is a large glass wall. You can also see some buildings inside the base. You can also see some ground vehicles parked around the base. Once you land you also notice that there is not only an additional artificial gravity in the base, but also oxygen. The gate closes above you when you power down your engines and a PA system informs you that the air is now breathable.`

They are wearing a trench coat, a hat, sunglasses and a mask, which fully conceals their identity. Inside the trench coat you can see what you think is body armour. You also se that he is armed with a large handgun. The man in the middle then proceeds to greet you.`
			`	"Welcome to FOB Luna Captain <first> <last>, I am the Handler," the man speaks in calm, monotone voice. "It is good to see that you have decided to come join us.

			`	The Handler then takes off his sunglasses. "Thought you'd never ask Captain, i however think that easier to show rather than tell, so let's take a look around Captain." The Handler then motions you to join him.`
			choice
				`	(Follow him)`
			`	The both of you exit the landing area through a gate. You can see that a machine gun turret is defending the entrance. Inside, you can see multiple large buildings. You can see multiple soldiers patrolling the area. "Alright Captain," the Handler explains to you, "This is the base's command center. This is where we process information that we receive about the outside world. This is also where we control our base defense, so it is heavily armed and is the only building with its dedicated shielding, life support and power generation. Sadly due to the sensitive nature of the building you will not be able to enter it, so let us proceed to the next area."`
			choice
				`	"Let us continue then."`
			`	You are then brought to another building. It looks like a sleek clean modern apartment. "This is the living quarters Captain," the Handler explains. "Almost all of the base's personnel live in here. There is 750 private rooms in here to accommodate all the personnel stationed here. There is also a cafeteria in there. You are welcome to explore it in your time but for now let us carry on."`
			`	The next area you are brought to looks like a shooting range. There is some walls with some padding surrounding the range, which you assume are there to reduce the noise coming from the shooting range. There are multiple soldiers currently using it. "This is the base's shooting range, anyone with access to this base is allowed to use it in their free time. A lot of soldiers use this place when they're bored and they have free time. Obviously though, it is closed during night time to not disturb the other personnel. Anyway, let's continue to the next place."`
			choice
				`	"Alright then."`
			`	After that, you brought to what a large building. It doesn't look as sleek or futuristic as the other buildings, but it isn't too brutalist looking. It is connected to the landing area through a large tunnel. "This is the base's repair and overhaul station," the Handler explains once more. "This is where your ship would be put in if you choose to upgrade your ship with our equipment. It is quite automated so only a few people are needed to monitor to whole operation. It also doubles as a small factory of sorts. We can produce some outfits, aircraft and ships in here. I can highly recommend that you look around here in your free time so you can see what we have. Anyways, let's continue to the final major building."`
			choice
				`	(Proceed)`
			`	The last building looks large and futuristic. You see a decent amount of people entering and exiting the building. "Alright Captain, this is the last place i wanted to show," the Handler explains, with a tiny bit more excitement in his voice this time. "This is the Training and Recreation center, one of the best reasons to join Arion's military, besides the countless other benefits. All major bases belonging to Arion has one of these buildings, or something similar to it. But, i think to truly show you why this is one of my favorite places to be in the base, i will have to bring you inside, so let's enter Captain."`
			choice
				`	(Enter the building)`
			`	The inside of the building looks very sleek and clean. Inside you can see a lot of personnel and equipment. There is a cinema, arcade and plenty of other things inside for entertainment. There is also a cafe and a bar. A bunch of simulators are also present inside, for entertainment and for training. There is a full body  VR simulator that simulates being anything from a maintenance personnel, to a foot soldier and many more. There are also multiple vehicle simulators, like tank simulators and fighter jet simulators to help train personnel in a safe environment and for entertainment. "Anyways Captain, since you have decided to work with us, you are free to use any of this equipment. Just make sure to not break anything, since it's really expensive."`

			`	"Well then Captain, i expect that we will meet again soon. After all, we have a lot of work ahead of us. Before you leave here is an Arion license Captain." He then proceeds to hand you a keycard of sorts. "This will allow you to enter our facilities and purchase our equipment. Also, we have some resupply jobs for you to do in the job boards, so keep an eye out for that. See you around Captain." The Handler and the 2 soldiers then proceed to leave.`

It appears today you will be assisting us in eliminating some 'Exile' ships. While the Korath Exiles regularly attack ships in Syndicate space this specific group has been quite troublesome. It also appears that some of the ships in this fleet have been significantly damaged so we should also eliminate them to prevent people from getting access to their equipment. How you decide to 'eliminate' this threat is up to you. You can blow them up, capture them or disable them. If you decide to disable them, we will send a team to repatriate them back to their homes so you won't have to worry about them. Also, i highly recommend that you take their 'Jump Drives' since those are always really useful. Anyways, let's do this."`

			`	"Alright Captain, it appears that we have a problem," the Handler explains. "While you have been useful in helping us weaken the Northern Dragons and prevent from getting alien tech, it appears that their operation was much larger than anticipated. While you were dealing with one of the operations of the Northern Dragons, they ramped up the other operations. This way they were able to gain a lot of technologies. While our other Strike Groups were able to put a stop to most of these operations, there is still a sizable operation happening in New Tortuga. Due to your past results when operating in a team, we have decided to give you a solo mission to test your capabilities."`

Now, while they may have worked with some shady groups in the past, we have information that suggests that the relationship between them is quite shaky. They have brought in a superheavy ship armed with alien technology to help reinforce the Northern Dragons. This ship is agile, has strong shields and has 2 fighter squadrons."`
				goto soloarionmission

			`	"I am sure that you remember the Northstar PMC from your time helping NCD co. It appears that they have been behind the new fighters gained by the Northern Dragons. While they have had a greatly profitable relationship with each other, it appears that there have been disagreements between the two over some recent events. It appears that they have been able to make another one of their Condottiere class superheavy ship and have upgraded it with alien technology. It is now being used to help reinforce the Northern Dragons."`

Hopefully if we disable them, they will rethink their choices and cut ties with the Northern Dragons, or at the very least stop directly supporting them. If we destroy them they might think that we are there to eliminate them too, which would make this mission much more difficult. Are you prepared?"`

It is armed to teeth, with turrets dotted across the entire station. There are also large docks for large ships and bays for smaller ones. There are also plenty of fighter hangars. You can also see that there are solar panels folded up on the sides of the station. The Handler directs you to one of the docking stations.`

			`	Eliza ponders for a few seconds and then answers your question. "Well as the Handler explained, one of the main reasons you were brought in was because of our lack of manpower. The other reason you are invited to join is more complicated. For simplicity sake, let's just say that you're special."`
				goto more

			label arionpurpose2
			`	"Well, as the Handler said, we are here to protect humanity, from both internal and external threats. We are also here to research new technologies, after all knowledge is power. The third and final reason is more complicated to explain. Basically, we are not from this universe. We like to explore universes and try to study them. During some of these trips we have encountered some 'unsavory groups'. It is in everyone's best interest that they do not set foot in this universe."`
				goto more

			label aliens
			`	Eliza smiles. "Well, let's just say that this universe is home to a lot of alien factions, so i'll just mention some of the more interesting ones."`
			`	"I think you should be familiar with at least 2 alien species already, the Hai and the Korath. I'm sure that you are familiar with the 2 factions of the Hai, the pacifist Hai government and the Unfettered Hai, a more hostile warrior faction. I'm sure that if you prove yourself to the Unfettered Hai, they might grow to like you. Our relationship with the Hai is relatively friendly, although like everyone else they don't know who we truly are."`
			`	"I'm sure you are also familiar with the Korath, specifically the Korath Exiles. As their name implies, they have been exiled. One of the reasons for these being their ability to make Jump Drives, which makes them a very reliable source of Jump Drives, if you are able to beat them anyways. Besides the Exiles, there are technically 3 other factions of Korath, 1 of which is the Efretti, a friendly, disarmed faction who can be found a few systems 'above' the Exiles space. There are also 2 warring autonomous drone factions that were originally Korath factions."`
			`	"The Quarg claim to be guardians of all species in this universe. They claim that they work for the Drak, an even more powerful alien civilization who are quite ancient. They try to maintain peace across the galaxy, although some factions despise them. The nearest outpost belonging to them can be found in Tarazed."`
			`	"The Pug are a mysterious race who don't appear to come from this galaxy. They meddle in other species' business and are very much not liked by the Quarg. They are sort of the 'guardians' of a species called the Wanderers, a species of 'birds' that are terraformers who fix broken worlds. Their space can be found above the northern pirate planets, although it can only be accessed with Jump Drives."`
			`	"The Coalition are well, a coalition. Specifically they are a coalition of 3 species that can be found under the Southern territories of human space. They were once at war with the Quarg and have captured 3 ring worlds belonging to them. They are now a disarmed society with no access to weapons whatsoever ruled by the Heliarch."`
			`	"The Remnant aren't technically aliens, but they are quite different from the rest of humanity. They have separated from the rest of humanity during the Alpha wars and now live in secrecy. They are excellent at reverse engineering alien tech and reconnaissance. If you happen to find them tell them we said hello." Eliza then proceeds to wink at you.`
			`	"There are also some extinct species', one of which being the Sheragi. They are huge sentient dragons with large superweapons who wiped themselves with said superweapons during a civil war. They were at war with the Hai and used to occupy a part of what became human space."`
				goto more

			label presence
			`	Eliza lets outs a sigh before explaining. "Well there are two reasons for that. One is that we would like to keep our operations here a secret for now. It would be a lot more complicated if our presence is widely known across the galaxy."` 
			`	"The bigger problem however is the fact that we do not have the manpower required to have a significant presence even if we wanted to be known. We only have a single Combined Division consisting of infantry, mechanized, armored, airborne and logistics battalions from the Foreign Legion, Main Force and the SFF for planetary assaults. We also only have 5 underpowered Strike Groups, so we are also poorly equipped to patrol a large area of space."`
			`	Eliza then shrugs. "Well at least we are doing well in some departments. We have some Navy ships stationed on some planets but they aren't really relevant to most missions. We also have a bunch of Air Force squadrons helping us out for missions like reconnaissance, bombing, air superiority and other stuff."`

			`	"Hmm, i guess since explaining our rank system would take quite some time and would be quite boring, let's just say that i mean the commander of this entire operation. All large scale operations will have to be approved by me and the only one who can veto my decisions, for most of the time anyways, is the Handler."`

			`	She grins. "Glad you asked Captain. This is FOB Bravo, one of our most advanced space stations. It's a relatively new addition to this expedition since the way our world works is quite different from yours. It has a sort of 'anchor' in place so that it can remain relatively close to Sol and so that ships can jump in here without this base needing to be in a system with other objects. It also has advanced cloaking systems and electronic countermeasures to allow this base to remain hidden."`
			`	"There is also a large command center in here so we can coordinate any large scale operations. We also have a large communications array so that we can give out orders without interruption. Just in case any hostile forces find this base, there is a large amount of drone ships that are to be deployed and countless anti ship and anti fighter batteries scattered across the base."`
			`	"If you would like, we can give you a base tour. After all, it's better to see for your self what this base has to offer."`

But when she sees the extent of your injuries, you see the blood drain from her face. "Oh, shit. Someone get a medic over here!"`
			`	The Handler calmly kneels down beside you and lets out a disappointed sigh. "I'm not mad, i'm just really disappointed," he says calmly. "I'll see you again later when you load your save Captain."`

			`	While you are walking to the next area, you see some soldiers patrolling across the base, armed to the teeth. You also see automated turrets ready to shred any intruders that might try to board the station. You also see a few ships docked while exiting the docks. They aren't like any ships you have seen before. Some of them are larger than even a Bactrian or Carrier.`
			`	You are first brought to the outfitter, shipyard and repair yards. You can see some ships being repaired. "This is the base's shipyard," Eliza explains. "Here we build new ships, repair broken ones and revamp old ones. Since you now have access to this base you can purchase larger and more advanced weapons, outfits and ships. I'm sure that you won't regret using our equipment. Anyways let us go the next area."`
			choice
				`	"Ok, let's continue."`
			`	You are then brought to the armory and shooting range of the base. Like last time, you see some people using the shooting range, firing everything from small pistols to laser rifles, machine guns and many more. "I am sure that the Handler has shown you the shooting range in FOB Luna. This station also has a shooting range, although sadly it is quite smaller. You should be able to find a bunch of our soldiers here who are waiting for their next mission. Feel free to explore shoot any weapons that you may have found in your journey here in you spare time. For now, we should continue with the tour."`
			choice
				`	(Proceed to next area)`
			`	The final area that you are brought to looks like the base's spaceport, although it looks more like an entertainment center. "This is probably one of the things that i miss the most when i'm not stationed here." The Handler says.`
			choice
				`	"Don't all Arion bases have entertainment centers?"`
			`	"Yeah, but the one here is the largest in this expedition," the Handler replies. "Well this is the place where a bunch of personnel will be staying long term when they don't have a mission so it makes sense that this place has the best RnR center," Eliza chimes in.`
			`	"Yeah i know, but still kinda makes me wish i was stationed here."`
			`	Eliza chuckles a bit. "I think a lot of people here would disagree with you, they would love to be on the field right now. Anyways, let's head inside."`
			`	Inside, you see an even larger entertainment center than the one in Luna. The restaurant is even larger and so are the facilities. You can see a bunch of people having fun. When you look closely you realize that some of them are alien species that you've never seen before. "This is the FOB Bravo's spaceport Captain," Eliza explains. "Here you cam find plenty of our personnel from all branches of our military relaxing. There is a bar and a restaurant should you need food and drinks. There is also a gym, simulators and many other things that can help soldiers relax and train. You are allowed to use the spaceport's facilities, just make sure not to break anything."`

			`	"Well Captain," Eliza says to you, "I guess that's it. Welcome to Arion, i hope you enjoy your stay. Feel free to explore this base more when you have the time. See you next time Captain."`
