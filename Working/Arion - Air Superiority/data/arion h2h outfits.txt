The MPF-01 Purifier is a powerful weapon, it has 2 gas tanks, one in its stock and another under its handguard, that can be refilled with the pump handle on the handguard tank. The fuel tank is located where a magazine would normally go and can be replaced with a hose that connects to a backpack filled with fuel and gas, much like normal flamethrowers. The legality of flamethrowers is very questionable so it should be alright to have one, although due to the nature of flamethrowers, they are heavily taxed when sold to non government entities.
