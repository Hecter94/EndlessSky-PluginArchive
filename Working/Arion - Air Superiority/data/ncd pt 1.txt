			`	While you are preparing to land, you spot a unique complex. It appears to be a large spaceport of sorts with a large landing area, but uniquely enough you can see what looks like an airport and heliport next it.`
			choice
				`	(Approach)`
				`	(Ignore it)`
					defer
			`	You proceed to approach the complex. However when you get closer, you can see that the complex is very heavily armed. Some fighters are on standby in the airbase while some helicopters are standing by in the heliport. You also see what you think are anti air batteries.`
			choice
				`	(Continue approaching)`
				`	(Flee)`
					defer
			branch hostile
				"reputation: Merchant" <= -100
			`	Even after seeing that the base is heavily armed, you continue to approach the complex. When you get close enough, the base hails you.`
			`	"Hello Captain, welcome to the <origin> branch of the National Combined Defense contracting," the voice speaks out to you. "If you wish to land and purchase some equipment, please proceed to landing pad 1.`
			choice
				`	(Land)`
				`	(Maybe next time)`
					defer
			`	You proceed to land at the designated landing zone. When you land, you see that the complex is composed of a large central building with a landing zone for spacecraft in front of it with multiple large hangars. There is also a small parking area near it filled with armed vehicles which you assume belongs to the complex. There is also a heliport and airport next to the building. It is filled with fighters and helicopters.`
			`	You then see 3 people approaching you. 2 of them are armed with rifles, while the man in the center is wearing a business suit. While he appears unarmed, you can see a slight bulge in his suit which you assume is a weapon.`
			`	"Hello Captain," the man with the suit introduces himself. "I am Sergei, the Manager of the National Combined Defense co. We are a relatively small company selling a lot of equipment ranging from firearms to large spacecraft. While we may be relatively unknown company, the effectiveness of our products makes it very favoured by anyone who knows of our existence." Sergei then stops talking for a few seconds before suddenly asking for your name. "Sorry Captain, it appears that i was too busy advertising the company to you that i forgot to ask for your name."`
			choice
				`	"I am Captain <first> <last> of the <ship>."`
				`	"Captain <last>. <first> <last>."`
			`	"Well then Captain <first> <last>," Sergei excitedly says to you. "It appears that this facility has been idling around today! So we have time to show around the facility, if you would like to."`
			choice
				`	(Agree to the tour)`
				`	(Decline the tour)`
					goto decline
			`	Sergei then appears excited. "Well then Captain, let us have a look around the facility!"`
			`	You are first shown the spaceport area. There are multiple hangars in the spaceport. You see a ship in one of the hangars. It is one of the largest ships you have ever seen. It looks like it has a large gun running down its center.`
			choice
				`	"What is that ship?"`
			scene "thumbnail/arionstarspear"
			`	Sergei chuckles. "That Captain, is the Starspear class railgun battleship. It is a formidable ship which has the capability to mount a special spinal railgun. I recon that it could easily take on a Navy cruiser or carrier. It also has a few drones just in case."`
			`	"If you want one, you'll have to gain our contractor license, which means that you have to earn it. Your best way of earning it is to do jobs for us."`
			`	"Anyways Captain, let's continue to the next area."`
			choice
				`	(Enter the main building)`
			`	When you enter the building, you see a clean interior with very little people walking around. Only a few of them are wearing uniforms, which you assume are the uniform of people working here. Sergei then turns toward you. "This is the main facility structure," Sergei explains to you. "Almost all of our products are manufactured on site. It is heavily automated so the only employees essential to this bases function are customer service, security guards and a small number of engineers to ensure that the factory runs well. Anyways Captain, let us see the manufacturing area."`
			choice 
				`	(Enter the manufacturing facility)`
			`	You then go deeper into the facility to reach the production sector. You see robots and machines working on everything from pistols and rifles to fighters and capital ships. There are maybe around only a total of a dozen people. "These robots and machines are one of the key reasons of why our products are so powerful," Sergei explains to you. "They can make a product with practically no defects and do it quickly, safely and with less cost than a normal factory. Alright then, i think thats enough of the manufacturing section. Let us move on the 'proving grounds'."`
			choice 
				`	(Enter the proving grounds)`
			`	You go back to the surface and reach the proving grounds. "This is the proving grounds, which is basically just a glorified shooting range," Sergei explains to you. "Here we test everything from rifles to ship mounted weaponry. Anyways, i think we can test out a few rifles here. Excuse me while a bring out some weapons for you to test."`
			`	Sergei then leaves you with one of his bodyguards and proceeds to go to the armory. When he returns he brings 2 rifles. "Alright Captain, i have 2 guns for you to test out. I have an AKS 74U and a M4A1. Which one do you prefer?."`
			choice
				`	"I prefer the AKS 74U."`
				`	"I prefer the M4A1."`
					goto m4a1
			action
				outfit "AKs 74u"
			scene "outfit/aks74u"
			`	"Alright then Captain, here is the AKs 74u. It's a neat carbine that you can use in tight spaces. It has a short barrel and a folding stock, so it is relatively easy to conceal, although relatively is a keyword."`
				goto guntest
			label m4a1
			action
				outfit "M4A1"
			scene "outfit/m4a1"
			`	"Alright then Captain, here is the M4A1. It's an assault rifle that you can use in CQB. It has an adjustable stock and a decent length barrel, so it is useful even outside of CQB."`
				goto guntest
			label guntest
			`	Sergei then gives you your new gun. "Remember Captain, be responsible with this firearm. Keep your finger off the trigger until you are ready to fire and don't point the gun at anything you aren't willing to destroy. Alright then, let us test this gun in the firing range." You are then brought to the firing range. It is a large open area. There are some targets down range for you to shoot.`
			choice
				`	Shoot at the targets further away in semi automatic mode.`
				`	Shoot at the targets near you in fully automatic.`
					goto fullauto
			`	You carefully shoot at the targets downrange. You hit a decent amount of your shots. Sergei is impressed. "Nice shooting Captain, that was decently accurate for someone shooting a carbine. Anyways, let us continue the tour."`
				goto HMMWV
			label fullauto
			`	You switch to full auto and shred the targets. You shoot some bursts at first but after reloading you decide to magdump one of the targets. Sergei is impressed. "Nice shooting, you handled that recoil decently well. You can keep the gun. Anyways Captain, let us continue the tour"`
				goto HMMWV
			label HMMWV
			`	You are then brought outside the main building. Sergei then speaks to you. "Alright then Captain, that should be it for the main building. Let us continue to the Heliport and the Airport. But before that let us see the motor pool."`
			`	You then see a car park in front of you. It has a big machine gun on top. "This is a Humvee. It's a light utility vehicle that we use when we are contracted to protect people on the ground. It has a M2 Browning mounted on top just in case anyone tries to mess with us. It's a relatively older vehicle but it is sufficient. Anyways, let's go to the motor pool."`
			choice
				`	Enter the car`
			`	You are then brought to the motor pool. You can see a bunch of vehicles in there. There isn't too much vehicles, probably around a hundred vehicles are there total, but there is a lot of variety. "Here we have a lot of ground vehicles. We have everything from small utility vehicles to cargo trucks, recovery vehicles, infantry fighting vehicles and main battle tanks. Anyways, let's look around." The 4 of you then exit the car and look around. You got to see a bunch of these vehicles up close. After you are done seeing these vehicles, Sergei brings you to one of the armored vehicles. "For the next part of our journey, let's use this Namer IFV."`
			choice
				`	Enter the armored vehicle`
			`	The armored vehicle is tracked. It is as large as a main battle tank but it can also carry infantry like an infantry fighting vehicle or armored personnel carrier. Much like the HUMVEE it is armed with a M2 Browning. "This is one of our main armored personnel carriers. This thing is basically a turtle, it's really hard to kill, although it lacks in firepower. It owes this durability due to the fact that its hull is based on an MBT. Besides its weight however one of its major drawbacks is that it's a major pain in the ass to transport since its so heavy. Anyways, let's go to the heliport."`
			`	The heliport is decently large. There are around a dozen helicopters currently in the heliport, although it looks like it can hold up to 4 times its current capacity. "We currently have 3 helicopter squadrons on standby," Sergei explains to you. We have a cargo, transport and attack squadron. We usually use a CH-47 Chinook, CH-53 Stallion or a V-22 Osprey for cargo while we use a Blackhawk or Super Huey for transport, although sometimes we use a Mi-35 Super Hind for areas with a lot more resistance. For attack we usually use a AH-1 Viper or AH-64 Apache, with the occasional KA-52. Obviously, this isn't a complete list of helis we fly, but that is the most common ones."`
			`	"Anyways Captain," Sergei says as he walks towards a helicopter starting up, "I think to go to the final part of our tour we can try flying in one of these helis."`
			choice 
				`	Enter the helicopter`
			`	The helicopter has a lot of weapons on board but it also has a compartment for passengers. "This is one of the helicopters i was talking about before," Sergei says as he boards the helicopter. "The Mi-35 is what happens when you combine an attack helicopter and a transport helicopter. It can carry a lot of weapons like rockets and anti tank missiles but can also carry troops at the same time. It can drop troops and then remain in the battlefield to support the troops. Personally, i think this is one of the best things to ever come out of the Soviet Union. Anyways," Sergei says as the helicopter starts up, "Lets give this thing a test ride."`
			`	The helicopter takes off and starts flying towards the airport. From the air you can see that there is quite a lot of planes in the airport. The helicopter lands with a solid thud and the doors open.`
			choice
				`	Exit the helicopter`
			`	There are all sorts of planes in the airport. Some appear to be transport planes while most appear to be fighter jets. "We currently have 9 squadrons at our disposal. A F22 and F15 squadron for air superiority. A F23 and F14 squadron to intercept enemies who get too close. A F35 and AV8 Squadron for ground attack just in case we get a contract to eliminate some enemy bases. And a F16 and F18 squadron for backup. We also have a C130 Squadron to transport supplies across the planet. Usually we also have an additional training squadron to train any buyer who wishes to purchase our aircraft but they are currently busy."`
			`	"Anyways Captain," Sergei says to you, "That should conclude today's tour. I hope that you will be a valuable customer or maybe even contractor for NCD co. Hopefully i will see you next time Captain," Sergei says as he starts to head back to the helicopter. "See you next time Captain <first> <last>."` 
				decline
			label decline
			`	Sergei appears to be disappointed with your answer. "Well then Captain, i will at least tell you some key points. You now have access to our ships and outfits in Earth, Bourne, Valhalla and Hephaestus. You can also check out the job boards for jobs that you can do for us in these locations. If you do tasks for us you will have access to more advanced jobs and maybe even access to our most advanced stuff. That should be all the key points Captain. Hopefully i will see you next time." Sergei and his 2 bodyguards then proceed to leave.`
				decline
			label hostile
			`	A few seconds after continuing to approach, you see some missiles approaching you from behind. Before you can react, they slam into your ship! The explosions causes some damage and stuns your ship.`
			`	Before you can retaliate, you see the base firing everything they have at you, from ground based artillery to SAM sites and AA batteries. You did not stand a chance.` 
			`	The last things you see before you hit the ground are fighter jets flying over you from behind you while helicopters fly towards you from the base.`

Rumor has it that they are one of the biggest sellers of our equipment on the black market. This makes them quite an important target.
