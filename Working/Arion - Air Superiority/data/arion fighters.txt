	description "A trainer aircraft made by Czechoslovakia, it has been modified and modernized to train pilots in space combat."
	description "The L39 albatross began its service in the Arion armed forces before the 'formation years wars' as a trainer/light attack aircraft. It trained numerous pilots to fight in numerous conflicts, and still performs this role to this day. It also had a brief career as an attack aircraft during the formation years, although nowadays it only serves in combat roles in an emergency. Plenty of civilians, militias and other countries also operate the Albatross wether as trainer aircraft, light fighters or for aerobatics."
	description "It has 1 countermeasure and 5 hardpoints, one of which is heavy to allow mounting a gun pod."

	description "This was an Attacker aircraft used by the US and some of its allies. It has been modified and upgraded extensively not only to survive modern combat but also to fly in space."
	description "A cheap and lightweight attack aircraft, a number of these planes were purchased even before the start of the 'formation years war.' They were radically upgraded and overhauled to give them a fighting chance in a new era of conflict. They were used a lot in the 'formation years war', supporting ground forces and moping out leftover enemies after air superiority is established. After the war, the Skyhawk is still used in vast quantities. It served even in 'WW3' in its modernized state, and after Arion became one of the galactic superpowers, it received a new upgrade, turning it into the F/A-4 Superhawk. The upgrade not only further increased survivability in a modern conflict, but also greatly enhanced its A2A capabilities, allowing it to be used against cheap and inferior aircraft, thus freeing up more advanced fighters. Nowadays it is mostly used by the Arion Army air corps and Marine air arm."
	description "This attack aircraft is equipped with 2 flare slots and 5 external racks, 3 of which are heavy racks."

	description "This was an Attacker aircraft used by the US. It has been modernized and upgraded extensively to survive in space combat."
	description "The Intruder and Prowlers were one of the surplus planes that was desperately purchased during the start of the 'formation year wars'. While the Intruder was put to work as an attack aircraft, the Prowler served to bolster Arion's EW capabilities. By the end of the early period of the war, the Intruder was relegated to a trainer, and was finally put to rest at the late stages. However, the Prowler served proudly until the end of the war, and even saw limited service in the frontlines of 'WW3'. The Prowler serves in the regular forces today as an EW training aircraft. In Militia service however, both variants serves proudly against pirates and other threats to Arion."

	description "Attacker originally used by the US, it has been modernized extensively and now also has the ability for space flight. Just be careful not to cause any friendly fire. Although, this plane is very different from the original version."
	description "Originally, a number of these aircraft were purchased during the formation years. They were immediately upgraded with new equipment, most importantly of all was a new and advanced IFF system that all units in Arion's military use. Its main gun was also improved to be more accurate and be able to penetrate more armour. The result was a great CAS aircraft that could exploit an enemy whose air denial assets were almost completely destroyed. Alongside the Su 25 it was used extensively to counter mostly insurgents, but sometimes it got to prove itself in fighting a near peer enemy by mopping up remaining targets. While their numbers have been significantly reduced, they still serve Arion's army air corp in fighting mostly insurgents."
	description "It has 2 countermeasures and 7 hardpoints, 3 of which are medium and one is a heavy."

	description "VTOL attack fighter that was originally made by the British and upgraded by the Americans, it has been upgraded even further and now has the ability for space flight."
	description "The AV-8 Harrier came into service with Arion before the formation years. At first it mainly served as the primary aircraft of the marine corps. It quickly proved it self during the formation years war, where it became a very valuable asset in wiping out any remaining air targets that the air superiority fighters missed, and providing CAS to any ground forces who needed it. It was also very valuable due to its VTOL capabilities, allowing it to operate from bases where no other fixed wing aircraft can. It still serves even with the introduction of more advanced VTOL aircraft, like the F35. It had a similar fate to the A-4 Skyhawk when Arion became a galactic power, it served in low intensity conflicts against inferior adversaries, and received an upgrade package that turned it into the F/AV-8 Super Harrier." 
	description "It has one flares slot, improved reverse thrust and 7 external racks, 3 of which are heavy racks. Its gun is mounted on an external rack."

	description "The Super Hornet has served the Arion armed forces in significant numbers since the start of the 'formation year wars.' It is beloved by those who fly it and those who serve beside it due to its unique capabilities to carry vast amounts of ordnance, and its multirole capabilities. It could serve as a tanker, which some of them were used as during the earlier years of Arion, before the acquired proper tankers. But even more importantly, it could serve as an electronic warfare aircraft, making it a very valuable force multiplier. It serves mainly in the Arion Navy and Marine Corps."

	description "The F14 started its service with Arion in limited numbers before the start of the 'formation year wars'. It was used a lot by the Arion navy as its premier heavy fighter and interceptor. At first it was extremely disliked by the maintenance crew, but after a total overhaul using Arion's technologies, it not only became a lighter and more capable aircraft, but a more maintainable one too. After the refit it continued to serve as the navy's main interceptor, earning a lot of air to air kills in the hands of an ace squadron."
	description "This fighter/interceptor has 1 flares and 7 external racks, 5 of which is a medium while 2 are heavy."

	description "A legendary fighter, this fighter has been there from the start for Arion in small quantities. The few units that were active during the start of the 'formation years' made a legendary name for them selves, being used by numerous aces. Both the C and the E model served well, mainly as an air superiority fighter for the former, and a strike fighter for the latter. It was the queen of the skies, especially in the hands of aces. While most of the C and E models were replaced by the more advanced EX models, it still served in significant quantities in the national guard and training units. Most of the units that were retired were not scrapped, either being turned into gate guardians, monuments, museum pieces, or sold in the civilian market."

	description "Much like the F5, the Starfighter was quickly purchased when the 'formation year wars' broke out to quickly bolster the Air Force. It was tasked with preventing incursions from bomber groups into important cities. It served well enough in the early stages and was already well on its way out in the middle stages. It was quickly picked up by militia forces who helped end the war. It served afterwards in small militias to defend against pirates. While it was hopelessly outmatched in dogfights, it was able to launch missiles and run before enemy fighters could retaliate."

	description "A legendary fighter, this fighter has been there from the start for Arion in small quantities. The few units that were active during the start of the 'formation years' made a legendary name for them selves, being used by numerous aces. Both the C and the E model served well, mainly as an air superiority fighter for the former, and a strike fighter for the latter. It was the queen of the skies, especially in the hands of aces. While most of the C and E models were replaced by the more advanced EX models, it still served in significant quantities in the national guard and training units. Most other units that were retired were not scrapped, either being turned into gate guardians, monuments, museum pieces, or sold in the civilian market."

	description "A very well respected fighter bomber that came in Arion's time of need, it has served in small quantities even at the start of the 'formation years war'. During the start, it was the only aircraft that was uniquely suited for strategic bombing, since at this time Arion lacked proper bombers. While it lacked the payload of proper strategic bombers, it made up for it by being able to defend itself. Nonetheless it was very crucial to the war effort, being able to strike strategic targets that otherwise was out of reach or too dangerous. Due to its successes as a strategic bomber, Su 34s are still used occasionally as light strategic bombers, even with the advent of proper bombers."
	description "This Fighter Bomber has 1 flares and 11 hardpoints, 7 of which are medium and 1 is a heavy."

	description "The Intruder and Prowlers were one of the surplus planes that was desperately purchased during the start of the 'formation year wars'. While the Intruder was put to work as an attack aircraft, the Prowler served to bolster Arion's EW capabilities. By the end of the early period of the war, the Intruder was relegated to a trainer, and was finally put to rest at the late stages. However, the Prowler served proudly until the end of the war, and even saw limited service in the frontlines of 'WW3'. The Prowler serves in the regular forces today as an EW training aircraft. In Militia service however, both variants serves proudly against pirates and other threats to Arion."

	description "A carrier based strategic bomber that was made by the US, it has been modified and modernized to serve once more."
	description "During the mid period of the 'formation year wars', a couple of these planes were purchased to give carriers a longer reach and more ordinance to drop. It also serves as a tanker and electronic warfare aircraft. While the majority of these planes were retired when Arion started to become a galactic superpower, it still serves in limited numbers to give carrier strike groups a strategic bomber. It also serves in Militias as a heavy strike fighter."
	description "This bomber has heavy countermeasures, electronic counter measures and an internal bomb bay. It has the ability to carry nukes and can also defend itself with a rear facing turret."

	description "A few of these planes were obtained during the mid period of the 'formation year wars' and became the first stealth aircraft used by Arion. It was used for the remainder of the formation years and served for until the start of 'WW3' in frontline service. Nowadays its service in the regular forces has been relegated to aggressor training. However in Militia hands, it's the most plentiful stealth aircraft."

	description "Not long after Arion's formation years, when Arion's economy has started to boom, a lot of voices in Arion's military was interested in the F35. Since Arion at this point has tight relationship with NATO countries, Arion was allowed to purchase the F35. All 3 variants were purchased and proved to be excellent multirole fighters. However Arion wanted to create a new version that combines all 3 F35s into one aircraft. The result was the F-35X. It has served well in any large scale conflict that Arion has gotten into, and continues to serve proudly."

Luckily of course, during one of Arion's many 'interdimentional' travels, they stumbled upon the Ocean Federation. Through them, they were able to obtained multiple stealth fighters, finally allowing Arion to operate stealth air superiority fighters. They served proudly and were very effective in the hands of both Aces and regular forces alike."

	description "After the formation years, when Arion became more involved with Earth's politics, they gained a lot of allies, one of them being South Korea. They decided to help fund the KF21 program and even helped upgrade it. The result is a relatively cheaper 4.5 gen fighter. Later upgrades help turn the fighter into a fully fledged stealth fighter, and it has since served well."
