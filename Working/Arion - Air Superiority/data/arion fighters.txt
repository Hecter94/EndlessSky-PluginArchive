	description "The X-47 was originally a prototype drone that was made by Northrop Grumman. It has been upgraded and modified to serve in space."
	description "The blueprints for the drone was then purchased by Arion after experimentation has stopped. It now serves as one of the main drones for the Arion Air Force, Fleet Air Arm, Foreign Legion, SFF and other allies to Arion under the designation 'FQ-101'. These drones can be operated as loyal wingman and as a defense system for the 'Arsenal Bird'. Although, this is an earlier version that still has the X-47 designation and is being sold as surplus."

	description "A trainer aircraft made by Czechoslovakia, it has been modified and modernized to train pilots in space combat."
	description "Due to the sheer amount of these fighters, a lot were purchased during the early formation years to help train new pilots and attack low threat ground targets. When things stabilized and Arion started to grow, a contract was signed to allow Arion to produce their own variant. It has since served as one of Arion's primary trainers and have had great success in the civilian market."
	description "It has 1 countermeasure and 5 hardpoints, one of which is heavy to allow mounting a gun pod."

	description "This was an Attacker aircraft used by the US and some of its allies. It has been modified and upgraded extensively not only to survive modern combat but also to fly in space."
	description "A cheap and lightweight attack aircraft, a number of these planes were purchased even before the start of the 'formation years war.' They were radically upgraded and overhauled to give them a fighting chance in a new era of conflict. They were used a lot in the 'formation years war', supporting ground forces and moping out leftover enemies after air superiority is established. After the war, the Skyhawk is still used in vast quantities. It served even in 'WW3' in its modernized state, and after Arion became one of the galactic superpowers, it received a new upgrade, turning it into the F/A-4 Superhawk. The upgrade not only further increased survivability in a modern conflict, but also greatly enhanced its A2A capabilities, allowing it to be used against cheap and inferior aircraft, thus freeing up more advanced fighters. Nowadays it is mostly used by the Arion army and marine corps."
	description "This attack aircraft is equipped with 2 flare slots and 5 external racks, 3 of which are heavy racks."

	description "Attacker originally used by the US, it has been modernized extensively and now also has the ability for space flight. Just be careful not to cause any friendly fire. Although, this plane is very different from the original version."
	description "Originally, 3 squadrons were lend leased to Arion during the formation years. They were immediately upgraded with new equipment, most importantly of all was a new and advanced IFF system that all units in Arion's military use. Its main gun was also improved to be more accurate and be able to penetrate more armour. The result was a great CAS aircraft that could exploit an enemy whose air denial assets were almost completely destroyed. Alongside the Su 25 it was used extensively to counter mostly insurgents, but sometimes it got to prove itself in fighting a near peer enemy by mopping up remaining targets. While their numbers have significantly reduced, they still serve Arion's army air corp in fighting mostly insurgents."
	description "It has 2 countermeasures and 9 hardpoints, 3 of which are medium and one is a heavy."

	description "VTOL attack fighter that was originally made by the British and upgraded by the Americans, it has been upgraded even further and now has the ability for space flight."
	description "The AV-8 Harrier came into service with Arion before the formation years. At first it mainly served as the primary aircraft of the marine corps. It quickly proved it self during the formation years war, where it became a very valuable asset in wiping out any remaining air targets that the air superiority fighters missed, and providing CAS to any ground forces who needed it. It was also very valuable due to its VTOL capabilities, allowing it to operate from bases where no other fixed wing aircraft can. It still serves even with the introduction of more advanced VTOL aircraft, like the F35. It had a similar fate to the A-4 Skyhawk when Arion became a galactic power, it served in low intensity conflicts against inferior adversaries, and received an upgrade package that turned it into the F/AV-8 Super Harrier." 
	description "It has one flares slot, improved reverse thrust and 7 external racks, 3 of which are heavy racks. Its gun is mounted on an external rack."

	description "The Super Hornet has served the Arion armed forces in significant numbers since the start of the 'formation year wars.' It is beloved by those who fly it and those who serve beside it due to its unique capabilities to carry vast amounts of ordnance, and its multirole capabilities. It could serve as a tanker, which some of them were used as during the earlier years of Arion, before the acquired proper tankers. But even more importantly, it could serve as an electronic warfare aircraft, making it a very valuable force multiplier. It serves mainly in the Arion Navy and Marine Corps." 
	description "It has 1 flare slot, 1 ecm slot, 9 external racks of which 7 is a medium rack while 5 are heavy racks."

	description "Interceptor originally used by the US and some of its allies, it has been modernized extensively and now also has the ability for space flight."
	description "The F14 started its service with Arion in limited numbers before the start of the 'formation year wars'. It was used a lot by the Arion navy as its premier heavy fighter and interceptor. At first it was extremely disliked by the maintenance crew, but after a total overhaul using Arion's technologies, it not only became a lighter and more capable aircraft, but a more maintainable one too. After the refit it continued to serve as the navy's main interceptor, earning a lot of air to air kills in the hands of an ace squadron."
	description "This fighter/interceptor has 1 flares and 7 external racks, 5 of which is a medium while 2 are heavy."

	description "A legendary fighter, this fighter has been there from the start for Arion in small quantities. The few units that were active during the start of the 'formation years' made a legendary name for them selves, being used by numerous aces. Both the C and the E model served well, mainly as an air superiority fighter for the former, and a strike fighter for the latter. It was the queen of the skies, especially in the hands of aces. While most of the C and E models were replaced by the more advanced EX models, it still served in significant quantities in the national guard and training units. Most other units that were retired were not scrapped, either being turned into gate guardians, monuments, museum pieces, or sold in the civilian market."

	description "The blueprint of this fighter was provided to Arion during a technology trade in the formation years. They were immediately put to work as an upgrade to the F15s used by some Aces, although it didn't really enter wide spread use. It still serves the same purpose it did 50 years ago, only to a lesser extent, used mostly as an aggressor aircraft."
	description "It has 1 flares, bonus maneuverability and the same number of hardpoints as a regular F15, although the center heavy rack is usually reserved for a main gun."

The few units that were active during the start of the 'formation years' made a legendary name for them selves, being used by numerous aces. Both the C and the E model served well, mainly as an air superiority fighter for the former, and a strike fighter for the latter. It was the queen of the skies, especially in the hands of aces. While most of the C and E models were replaced by the more advanced EX models, it still served in significant quantities in the national guard and training units. Most other units that were retired were not scrapped, either being turned into gate guardians, monuments, museum pieces, or sold in the civilian market."
	description "It has 1 countermeasures and 7 hardpoints, 5 of which are medium and 3 are heavy. It can also carry a nuke."

	description "Fighter bomber originally used by the US and other countries, it has been modernized extensively and now also has the ability for space flight."
	description "The Aardvark began its service in the Arion armed forces shortly after the beginning of the 'formation year war'. A number of these were purchased to quickly bolster Arion's strike fighter capability, although this wouldn't last for long. While it saw great successes as a strike fighter, being used to quickly strike high value targets, it was most famous in its electronic warfare configuration. In its EW configuration, it earned a legendary reputation, almost no aircraft was lost when a Raven was nearby. Nowadays it is mainly used for rapid strikes against high value targets."
	description "This fighter bomber has 1 flares, 1 ecm, 1 internal bomb bay and 5 external racks, 3 of which are medium while 1 is a heavy. It also has the ability to carry a nuclear weapon."

	description "A very well respected fighter bomber that came in Arion's time of need, it has served in small quantities even at the start of the 'formation years war'. During the start, it was the only aircraft that was uniquely suited for strategic bombing, since at this time Arion lacked proper bombers. While it lacked the payload of proper strategic bombers, it made up for it by being able to defend itself. Nonetheless it was very crucial to the war effort, being able to strike strategic targets that otherwise was out of reach. Due to its successes as a strategic bomber, Su 34 are still used occasionally as light strategic bombers, even with the advent of proper bombers."
	description "This Fighter Bomber has 1 flares and 11 hardpoints, 7 of which are medium and 1 is a heavy."

Since Arion at this point has tight relationship with NATO countries, Arion was allowed to purchase the F35. All 3 variants were purchased and proved to be excellent multirole fighters. So with the US's permission Arion created their own version. The result was a stealth fighter that combined features from all 3 variants."

Since there was also a program the turn the F22 into a strike fighter, the leaders decided why not and greenlit the project. While not as successful, it still served its purpose well as a naval stealth interceptor."

	description "After the formation years, when Arion became more involved with Earth's politics, they gained a lot of allies, one of them being South Korea. To help them with the defence of their country, Arion made an offer to make upgraded version of the kf 21. South Korea agreed. The KF 21 has been vastly improved, with one of its most notable upgrades being a fully internal weapons bay, making this a true stealth fighter. It served Arion, South Korea, Indonesia and Poland well."

	description "A small amount of A6 Intruders were captured in the very early days of the formation years. They were immediately modified and upgraded to have a fighting chance as a stop gap measure. Some of the Intruders however were immediately modified to become a Prowler to help Arion in its EW role. These aircraft served well and were only mostly retired from frontline duty after the end of the formation years. Nowadays, the remaining planes in service are either used for training or for preservation."

	description "The Super Hornet has served the Arion armed forces in significant numbers since the start of the 'formation year wars.' It is beloved by those who fly it and those who serve beside it due to its unique capabilities to carry vast amounts of ordnance, and its multirole capabilities. It could serve as a tanker, which some of them were used as during the earlier years of Arion, before the acquired proper tankers. But even more importantly, it could serve as an electronic warfare aircraft, making it a very valuable force multiplier. It serves mainly in the Arion Navy and Marine Corps."

	description "The Aardvark began its service in the Arion armed forces shortly after the beginning of the 'formation year war'. A number of these were purchased to quickly bolster Arion's strike fighter capability, although this wouldn't last for long. While it saw great successes as a strike fighter, being used to quickly strike high value targets, it was most famous in its electronic warfare configuration. In its EW configuration, it earned a legendary reputation, almost no aircraft was lost when a Raven was nearby. It served for quite some time, but has mostly been relegated to service in the national guard, or for training."
