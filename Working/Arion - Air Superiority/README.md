# Arion - Air Superiority

An Endless Sky plugin that adds a variety of things to endless sky, including: 

- Real life fighters and bombers
  
- Fighters from some other games
  
- A bunch of new H2H weapons based on real life weapons
  
- Advanced outfits
  
- Powerful and unique weapons
  
- Superweapons
  
- Custom capital ships
  
- 1 (or 2) new 'short campaigns' and some new jobs
  
- ETC

To get access to the content visit Earth, Valhalla, Hephaestus or Bourne. Perhaps helping them out by doing some jobs and missions is a good idea. You could also just have a high combat rating or finish the main campaign (although i reccomend just visiting the previously planets first for more content).

There are also some bonus content if you have the lost in midnight, mega freight, czartraks ships, amphibious ships, altera or navycampaign (by kestrel1110) plugin. To access the bonus content, move the respective files from the bonus file to the data file.
