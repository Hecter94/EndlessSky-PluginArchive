	description "The Behemoth always straddled the line between freighter and warship; the only thing preventing it from being a pirate's dream was its slow, lumbering nature. After all, you can't plunder what you can't catch. This Behemoth has been heavily modified to remove that particular weakness."

	description "Admiral Onarina's Aerie has been a terror of the far north for as long as any living captain can remember. Legend tells that the Straight and True has been handed down from captain to captain for generations, making it one of the oldest Aerie-class ships in space. Each captain has left their own mark on this venerable vessel in one way or another; hundreds of years of tweaks and upgrades have reconfigured the ship above and beyond the capabilities of any other Aerie."
	description `Dual electron beam turrets appear to be the most recent installations on this ship: Even if you, the new owner, were to replace them, the upgraded turret infrastructure that came with the installation should allow for beefier guns. Between them, a complement of torpedoes, and two fighter hangars, this ship alone really does boast the firepower of a small fleet - perhaps explaining why its previous owner claimed the title "Admiral".`

Though bulked out to the point where it's liable to struggle with atmospheric maneuvering, this fightercraft looks like it'd be a mighty terror in the void (for its weight class, at least). The engine compartment was reworked to accomodate a potent set of Deep Sky atomics, while firepower has been increased to a linked set of javelin launchers.`

	description "Although the Osprey is an elegant and powerful ship, there's one particular detail (aside from the price tag) that's kept it from being even more popular with pirates than it always is: the ship's somewhat underwhelming crew capacity leaves little room for error on boarding operations."
	description "Significant modifications to this particular Osprey have made strides towards addressing that issue. Strong grav-clamps, powered magnets, and even grasping arms surround a ventral airlock resplendent with cutting hardware and built-in grenade launchers. Boarding operations made by this ship involve clamping to the site of choice, cutting a new entryway into the unfortunate victim, and flushing a generous quantity of explosives into breach. It's hardly a subtle way of plundering a ship, but certainly does wonders for the life expectancy of the boarding crew."

	description `The Betelgeuse Shipyards Leviathan has been in service for a long time, and this one longer than most. Rumors hold that this particular hull has been passed down the matriarchal line of a clan of "pirate queens" of the Far North for several centuries. Well-maintained and upgraded by every successive owner, the Queen Reject has grown in capability to rival any military cruiser. The addition of modernized shielding technology and lightweight hull composites have resulted in an unusually agile version of this venerable design without sacrificing any protection.`

	description "They say the Abomination is simply the sum of two ships welded together, nothing more, nothing less. Composed mainly of an old Bactrian hull, a Mule has been attached - against all wisdom - to its flank. Just for good measure the Bactrian's command center was then re-mounted on the mule, and the new gaping hull in the donor ship converted to a hangar for multiple fightercraft."
	description "They say the Abomination was the first Bactrian ever built. Centuries of repair, refurbishment, and replacement have left it without a single component in common with that venerable vessel which rolled out of spacedock so long ago. Does that mean it's still the same ship?"
	description "They say the Abomination is respected across the galaxy as a sovereign nation, untouchable by lawkeepers or the Navy. How is that accomplished? A well-stocked nuclear torpedo bay, naturally.
	description "They say the Abomination used to be painted a spicy shade of red and possesed hotrod flames blazing down its flanks. As soon as the paint was stripped the engines inexplicably suffered a 20% efficiency loss that they've never recovered from."
	description "They say the Abomination is more than the sum of its parts, somehow transcending the limitations of the Mule and Bactrian to attain a harmonious synthesis. This is the pinnacle of the shipbuilder's art."
	description "They say a lot of things about the Abomination. Do you believe them?"
