	#2) Blaster shuttle, randomly respawning every few months to track you down and get revenge. Nothing special about the ship.
	#   -Missions
	#3) Marauder+1 Behemoth, up-armored and hotrodded with extra engines.

	#4) Marauder+1 Corvette. Handles a bit worse than a corvette, but with defenses similar to a M.Falcon.

	#5) Marauder+1 Osprey. Just an all-around better Osprey.

	#   -Flavor
	#6) Marauder+1 Falcon. Like a Marauder Falcon, but it has the upgrades of both variants.
	#  X-Ship data
	#  X-Sprite
	#  X-Thumbnail
	#  X-Person
	#   -Flavor
	#7) Marauder+1 Leviathan. Sorta' like the +1 Falcon; it's just both upgrade paths smushed together.
	#   -Ship data
	#   -Sprite
	#   -Thumbnail
	#  X-Person
	#   -Flavor
	#8) Marauder Bactrian. There's already one in-game as a person ship, but this one will be capturable.
	#  X-Ship data
	#  X-Sprite
	#  X-Thumbnail
	#  X-Person
	#   -Flavor
	#9) Some sort of famous smuggler. Uses merchant swizzle, hull will have built-in scan interference. Maybe a mod argosy. Basically a Millennium Falcon sort of ship.

	#10) Marauder+1 Aerie. Approaches the power level of a Carrier.
