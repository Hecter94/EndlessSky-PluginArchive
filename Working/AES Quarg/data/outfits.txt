outfit "Intrusion Countermeasures"
	"capture defense" 120
	description `Quarg don't posess a great deal of physical strength, so in case they need to protect themselves inside their ships or ringworlds, they employ these small, precise sentries, that fire bursts of concentrated starlight on attackers.`
	description `	In the case of humans, merely witnessing too many of the shots could lead to permanent vision loss.`

	"energy consumption" 0.02
	"unplunderable" 1
	description `Despite their imposing stature, Quarg bodies are relatively frail and weak when compared to other species. To overcome their natural disadvantages in ground combat, they developed this suit, which combines a flexible, cold nanofiber with a powered, armored exoskeleton, with small, dark porous bits on each end of the forearms, which can focus energy in one particular direction, essentially firing a miniature blaster.`
	description `	On top of it all, the suit can momentarily generate a powerful personal shield, providing very high protection to the wearer for its duration. But the Quarg have other means of defending their ships, so this combat suit is almost exclusively used for the ground defense of Quarg ringworlds.`
