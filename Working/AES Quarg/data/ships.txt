	description `Once, when for the first time their Wardragons proved insufficient for dealing with threats, the Quarg decided to improve upon the design of their standard use-case warship. Proving to be a worthwhile successor and step-up from the classic Wardragon, only dire circumstances warrant the deployment of this design.`
	description `	Any forces capable of braving a confrontation with the Quarg should surely reconsider upon seeing any variation in the standard fleet composition of the Quarg.`

	description `In what is a distant memory for many Quarg, the Balaur design serves as the keystone of the great armadas that stand in vigilance of any who could stand to oppose the Quarg. In it's fabled existence, the great Balaurs that roam serve and sustain scores of craft that live independent from mainline Quarg society, but remain bound by loyalty to their own.`
	description `	In a twist from Quarg nature, these regiments are nomadic and are seldom ever found within inhabited space, typically acting as an exploratory force when their forces aren't required to aid mainline Quarg operations.`
