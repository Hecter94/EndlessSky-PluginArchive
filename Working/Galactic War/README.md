## About
This is a massive content mod about a war in another galaxy. While no storyline exist yet there's a large galaxy to explore filled with various aliens with different advancement and specializations.

Currently the plugin consist of:

* 1 Accessible galaxy.

* 26+ Races with their own ships and outfits. Some with unique mechanic such as territory changes or even hunt you down depending on your interactions.

* Over 100 Ships,

* Over 600 Outfits,

* Over 1500 Systems.

## Accessing the Contents

To find the galaxy, head up to the system north of Ka'ch'chrai(The capital) in the Wanderer space, the wormhole will be in between Sko'karak and Pug Iyik

This plugin is complatible with Omnis and World Forge developer plugins, though, World Forge support will be missing some functions and may be slightly outdated.

## Known Issues
Galaxy image not appearing. To fix this, turn on "reduce large graphic" option in the setting and restart the game.

Game slowing down when jumping with hyperdrive. Due to the number of systems this plugin add and game's pathfinding, unfortunately the only fix is to get better hardware.

Game slowing down/freezing when escorts have high-range jump drive. Similar reason to above, use shorter-ranged jump drive or don't use escorts.

Lite version: (Very Outdated)

This version will have less animation frames and exclude @2x images to reduce memory required to load the plugin. Use this if you're using low end machines or 32 bit machines.
