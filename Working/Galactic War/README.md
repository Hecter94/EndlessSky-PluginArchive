# Galactic-War
This is a repository for the Endless Sky mod "Galactic War".
The mod is currently in development stage, so many things are subject to change later on.

Currently the mod requires Endless Sky version 0.10.3+ to work properly.
(Only 0.10.3 feature used is the plugin.txt file really, it'll work with 0.9.15 still)
Version above this is usually compatible as well. Endless Sky backward compatibility is exceptional so far.

## About
This is a massive content mod about a war in another galaxy. While no storyline exists yet, there is a large galaxy to explore, filled with various aliens that have different advancements and specializations.

Currently the plugin consist of:

* 1 Accessible galaxy.

* 27 Races with their own ships and outfits. Some with unique mechanics such as territory changes or they can even hunt you down depending on your interactions with them.

* Over 100 Ships,

* Over 600 Outfits,

* Over 1500 Systems.

## Accessing the Content

To find the galaxy, head up to the system north of Ka'ch'chrai (the capital) in Wanderer space, and the wormhole will be in a system between Sko'karak and Pug Iyik.

This plugin is complatible with the Omnis and World Forge developer plugins, though World Forge support will be missing some functions and may be slightly outdated.

## Known Issues
Galaxy image not appearing. To fix this, turn on "reduce large graphic" option in the settings menu and restart the game.

Game slowing down when jumping with hyperdrive. Due to the number of systems this plugin adds and the game's pathfinding methods, unfortunately the only fix is to get better hardware.

Game slowing down/freezing when escorts have high-range jump drive. Similar reason to above, use shorter-ranged jump drives or don't use escorts.

Lite version: (Very Outdated)

This version will have fewer animation frames and exclude @2x images to reduce memory required to load the plugin. Use this if you're using low end machines or 32 bit machines.
