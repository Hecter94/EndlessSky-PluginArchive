This design became less important in modern days where most spaceports were well equipped resulting in decreased popularity of the ship among the more experienced captains."

	description "Dels Dardornai warship designed to fight against the Kroom invaders due to low supply of Decso from the Kaote, the new ship is designed to be manufactured within Dardornai space. Due to lack of advanced facilities and experience it was made from multiple smaller parts instead of a single large cast. While not as mass-efficient as using fewer larger parts it allows faster replacement of damaged parts than repairing damages, which can be critical in combat-intensive area the Dardornai guards. Unlike the Decso, Dardornai Caodauri have shorter operational range in exchange for armour and other systems as their territory is far smaller than that of the Kaote."
