The drones orbit your ship for a few second before one of it projects a video at your viewport showing you the location of the spaceport of this planet.`
			`	The drones scattered away as you landed. You exited your ship and see a glossy white skinned alien shaped like a bowling pin with 3 pitch-black eyes on three side of its head, one flat arm that splits into many smaller tentacles at the top holding a game-controller like device and no feet, the alien seems to be floating slightly above the ground. It doesn't seems to be saying anything or maybe you just couldn't hear it.`

			`	You refused to pick it up. The alien stood there waiting for you action for a while before a drone similar to ones that navigated you here arrives and projects an animation of two of the alien communicating by showing various similar symbols being sent and received between the two, then switched one side to you and show how both use different set of symbols and how it is not received by both side, then it display a model of a star system next to it. The orbits of planets display begins to accelerate along side with the communication between you and alien, showing a slight bit more of symbols being received and not just passing through each side. The system model then accelerates to speed faster than you can keep track of, and now you and the alien appears to communicate perfectly. Then it shows that if you pick up and use the device near perfect communication can be achieved in less than a day, it also shows the other benefit of the device such as communication ship to ship and ship to the spaceport as well as exo-solar communication with the Nuru and access to buying items in their store.

			`	The hologram displays a creature that looks like upside-down leaf with hundreds legs and 6 arms at the front, the Nuru points at the large label and read as "Muk", this appears to be their name. A model of you appears next to it, you estimated that the alien about 1 to 2 meters length and 50 to 80 centimetres wide. Their back can bend both back and forth and they can jump very far. Their body and resist force pushing them from above but not from below. They have two major groups, each lived on separate landmass. One is primarily carnivorous another is an omnivore. One is more aggressive and another is more of a pacifist. They have access to metals and are beginning to make use of it on large scale for tools. That all the details you understand. You thank them and leave.`

			`As instructed by the Nuru, you turn on your the cloaking device installed on your ship as you approach the planet. You also noticed a Nuru ship departing from the moon following you before it activates its cloaking device, probably just to keep an eye on you.`
			`	Most of the planet seems to be untouched by intelligent life with settlements are quite hard to spot but once found, many others will follow. It appears like most towns and villages are clustered around the same area roughly a few hundred meters apart from each other. There is a notable lack of any plantation around these settlements. You counted 3 clusters on the largest continent one with wildly different architecture when compared to the other two. While the two largest cluster of villages and towns are mostly constructed with wood and stone, few carved into a single huge boulder. Both groups are found in the plains strictly avoiding the jungle area. The other cluster are found inside a large crater a fairly large distance away from the other two with unusually large buildings glittering in silver, inconsistent in shape and size.`

			`	You decided to take a closer look at this cluster of villages. It suddenly becomes clear to you these are remains of spaceships and the inhabitants of this planet have no idea how to work with it. Wood and stones were used to wall off exposed parts, animal skin to cover the holes of the metal parts. Some smaller remains are piled together to form the roofs and wall, though, even these smaller parts would've still be the size of a truck at minimum so they must have some way to move it around. What gives it away is the engine half-buried in dirt used as the centre of one of the village.`

			`You moved on to the next continent which covers slightly less area than the larger continent but much more splintered by water and becomes more like a cluster of islands. This time it's much easier to spot a village due to their vast farmlands unlike those inhabiting the larger continent. Buildings here are usually elevated above the ground either with wooden poles or built on a pile of stones, some are even connected by bridges. Larger stone structures are more common here than on the other continent. Towns closer to the shore appears to have some fortifications built around it unlike towns in other areas including the larger continent. Villages here are also much less grouped together and expanded across larger area, main road between some of them can also be identified. None of these settlements stand out as much as the crater area of the larger continent.`
