			`As you entered the planet's atmosphere you noticed a fairly large patch of white giant mushrooms sticking out from its surrounding. From quick scan you also noted some similarly large buds hidden barely beneath the the roof of fungi forest and respond differently to your sensor than regular mushrooms surrounding it, ones deeper inside from the edge of the patches also contains some clump of things you simply don't recognize.`

			`	You fly closer to the mushrooms and noticed some movement or change within the mushrooms in your sensors, you cannot make out exactly what moved. A deeper scan into some of the odd mushrooms shows some form of complex organs or bio-machine contained within them. Suddenly, the name just popped in your head "Uoorn", for sure it didn't come from you. While you don't sense any immediate danger you get a feeling that they will certainly retaliate in some way if you attack them. As you question about these odd feeling it comes to you that it is that forest of giant mushrooms below you communicating telepathically.`
			choice
				`	(Ask for more information about them)`
				`	(Ask why they are here)`
			`	You felt like staring into the void of space, with a weapon in one hand to face against whatever horror might be out there, something you can't see until they appear from the dark right in front of you and you fight with whatever you have. A guardian of something, there to fight not for survival or loyalty but an instinctive sense of duty. What they fight is not specified.`

			`	You landed next to the patch and get into your spacesuit to learn more about them. The mushrooms looks even bigger up close with each of them towering around 10 meters above you, the caps of fully grown mushrooms grows up to six meters in diameter. These "mushrooms" do not have rings or gills as you might've expected of normal mushrooms only a few thick ridges under the cap more in form of structural support. Stem emerges directly from the ground without any base or remains of their bulb. Each have featureless glossy white color. Further inside you see a giant egg-shaped buds only slightly shorter than the mushrooms with seams running along its height, unlike the mushroom stem these buds have more bumpy texture.`

			`	For a while there's nothing remarkably different as you go deeper into the forest of giant mushroom, however, after a while you begin to feel like there's some sort of pattern as if you're walking in circle yet you're quite sure yourself that you're not.`

You feel the emotions of anger and resentment being directed at you as you run. You managed to get inside your ship unscathed, you hear sounds of something small but solid collides with the hull of you ship and quickly fire up your ships' engines. There's some resistance as you try to get your ship off the ground but it wasn't too much to handle. You look at your sensors as you ascend into space and see at least a dozen ships following you...`

Suddenly, you get feeling of anger and hate directed at you, you feel that something hostile is approaching you. Almost immediately after, a swarm of white ships some organic, some covered in hard shells emerges from the patch of mushrooms and the cloud of dust in the area you bombarded. Following behind the ships is a swarm of massive creme-colored tendrils tipped with point or blade, all coming towards you. Without a second thought you fired up your engines and leave the planets' atmosphere.`

			`	You find the closest patch of giant mushrooms, presumably the Uoorn, and try to think about the aliens you saw with spiky black ships. It didn't take long before the Uoorn notice and answer you. Time felt long, you felt like you can feel the slight rotation of the galaxy spinning backward by several millions years, you feel like a fresh recruit being sent to the frontline in a war, for million years they fought in an endless stagnant war where only fronts they fight changes. Not once they felt demotivated, not once they felt tired or question the reason they have to fight, they just fight to keep them at bay. Like a perpetual machine that never stop running. They never know the origins of the Gargoor'an, for the Uoorn, they are just there to be fight and hold back at all cost. Unlike your first contact with them, this "conversation" feels more glitchy, incoherent, or missing some information. Presences of you? them? Gargoor'an? popping up in random position across the galaxy. You feels some difficult to explain horror if the Gargoor'an breakthrough and won. Whole galaxy consumed and turn lifeless as countless more of these alien ships raise to continue their invasion in another galaxy. It was a little confusing as many barely connected pieces of information flows into your mind in a short amount of time but from what you get the Uoorn where fighting these aliens they called Gargoor'an since their very beginning, and they apparently fight them everywhere across the galaxy, at least in the past. You don't get any information how they or the Gargoor'an got there.`
