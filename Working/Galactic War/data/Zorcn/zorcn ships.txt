	description "The Genex was built as anti-fighter cruiser armed with Ronc missile turrets as its main armament along with Huer anti-missiles. The large amount of anti-missiles on this ship made allows it to easily shoot down a whole barrage of missiles. While their shield depleted rather quickly compared to the Navy Carrier, it was made up with superior armor technology that allows it endure more damage."
