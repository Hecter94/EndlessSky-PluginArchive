	description "Ultaka splitting energy missile E40R-D is the most effective weapon aginst both tiny fighers and big battleships as their splited energy projectile will home around the enemy making them extremely hard to dodge and can drain energy from ships with thick missile defense by making the Anti-missiles busy shoting tiny fragments down allowing larger missile to get pass the missile defences, if Anti-missiles target the larger missile the tiny missile fragment can hit and deal ionize the enemy."
