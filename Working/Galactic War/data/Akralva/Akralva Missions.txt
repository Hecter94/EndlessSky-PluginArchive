It was a struggle as they're very strong and resilient but you eventually manage to do it, miraculously without any loss. Looking closer at the alien it stand about 2.5 meters tall with bulky build, it have slightly long head length wise with mouth similar to crabs, their black eyes located right under a black colored beetle-like hard shell with a few child's fist-sized spike along the middle of it that covers the top half of their head. It also have similar looking shell but without the spike on its forarm and lower legs which made it looks bigger than their upper arms and upper legs. The rest of their body is covered by bi-metal armour of grey and orange but doesn't seems to cover the joints too well and were meant for ranged combat -to which it did gave you and your crew a hard time- and you can still catch a glimpse of their skin under it which is creme colored and reflects similarly to their shells but looks thinner. Their hands looks like three crab pincers stacked together and could be retracted under the shell of their forearm, which they sometimes do when they punch.`

It also have similar looking shell but without the spike on its forarm and lower legs which made it looks bigger than their upper arms and upper legs. The rest of their body is covered by bi-metal armour of grey and orange but doesn't seems to cover the joints too well and were meant for ranged combat. The one in front of the group appears to be the leader have their head painted with bright red lines across the middle length-wise.`
