# Kaynz

Kaynz is a plugin for [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io) which plans to add an entire story arc to the original game.

### Story arc description

The goal is to add an ulterior story arc to the main game, which puts it, as of the moment this is redacted, after the wanderer storyline.
The plugin will add a new galaxy to the game, with a new race: the Kaynz. They are intended to be a tier 4 alien race, capable of taking down Drak ships (with some difficulty however), a detail important to the lore.
The Kayn people are intended to be human-like, however slender, smaller, and with a pronounced blue skin. 
They will come in three main factions :
* The Kayn Empire: The original faction of the Kaynz, a stagnant empire in almost every way, yet still powerful
* The Kayn Republic: The first of the two factions separated from the Empire. They still maintain relationship with the Empire, but there clearly is tension between those two factions. They are ruled by an elected Senate, or they pretend it to be that way, and is thriving economicaly.
* The New Kaynz form the last main faction, which also seceded from the Empire. They are at war with both the Empire and the Republic, however there is not much fighting going on. They are ruled by a closed council, and are thriving on a military and a technological standpoint.
The storyline will involve a first contact between humans and kaynz, the future of their relationship and the conclusion of the Kayn internal conflict

### Current status
