They take you into a blinded vehicle and transport you inside some kind of warehouse, probably to keep the location hidden and secret. Then two regular Navy officers take the relay and bring you to an hidden observation facility that extends beyond the warehouse.`

			`	As you prepare to get inside what appears to be the meeting room, you notice a familiar voice`
			`	"Captain <last>! shouts Freya while making a poor excuse of a military salute, before laughing about that and embracing you. It really as been a while, and I missed having a friend around, especially in that gladiator pit, she says while pointing back at the meeting room."`
			`	"Is everything alright?" you ask.`
			`	"So far so good, but I can't shake off the felling that many of the Navy officers are displeased by our presence, especially..."`
			`	"Well, hello there captain <last>!" You turn back and realize that Admiral Danforth just arrived with other Navy officers in the room. "Oh, I'm sorry! Have I interrupted something?", he says while appearing genuinely surprised and sorry about that, but you understand he might have overheard your conversation and stopped it before those officers may overhear it has well, and coud have gotten offended. "Well since you are both here, I guess we can all go inside the meeting room, to inform you of the situation."`
			choice 
				`(Follow them)`
			`You walk inside the meeting room and discover a tactical room with a fancy screen table. Once everyone is ready, Danforth starts briefing you on the situation:`
			`	"Well has you've certainly been informed already by your friend Freya, we recently picked a gravitational anomaly in this system, and since the anomaly seemed to persist, it became apparent a deeper investigation was needed. We first called your friend Mrs Winters alongside other specialists, since she is the one with the most experience out there in human space on this domain. Thanks to her, we have discovered that this is most likely a forming wormhole".`
			`	As he explains that, he hands you the latest readings, which seem to ressemble the ones you gathered when the Eye opened back in Wanderer space. But before you can compare the two yourself, a Navy officer declares:`
			`	"As explained by Admiral Danforth, Mrs Winters has proven herself to be a useful... help." You can't shake of the idea that he meant 'asset'. "As for you however, captain <last>, I don't see what kind of help you may provide us with."`
			`	"We already had that discussion!" exclaimed Danforth. "Captain <last> has already proven its value and reliability in the past! Both with the Pug incident and the Alpha attacks against the Oathkeepers... During which, if I remember right, you didn't help with!". Many of the Navy officers seem offended by that last remark, but before any of them can respond, Danforth continues his speech. "While you were 'protecting the population', meaning the paradise worlds of course, captain <last> went to help us, and if it wasn't for his intervention, we would most likely have been annihilated. Then the alphas would have just had to deal with the rest of you, and all of human space."`
			choice 
				`(Keep listening)`
			`	The officers remain speechless from that speech. You are astonished by the tensions between those two groups, who you always believed formed an fierce union.`
				"Also, you forget that captain <last> has actually travelled through space, beyond the boundaries of human space, and is thus the most qualified person around to deal with first contact. And since we are most likely dealing with a wormhole, which may lead to another alien space, he may be of a great help."`
			`	As there is an awkward silence going on, you hear Freya speaking. "And he may have already proven his usefulness to this situation". You turn and notice that she borrowed your ship readings of the Eye formation and compared it the anomaly readings. "Captain <last> apparently witnessed the formation of a wormhole in Wanderer space, named 'the Eye', according to the ship logs. And those readings match up too well to be the ones from the anomaly for this to be just a coincidence. So I am pretty confident while stating that we have definitive proof that we are dealing with a wormhole."`
			`	"Very well then, I don't think there is anymore reason to have doubt about him."`
			choice
				`(Thank Freya)`
				`(Continue listening)`
					label "FW listen"
			`	"Thanks for your intervention, but could I ask you not to peek into my ship data without my consent in the future?" you ask.`
			`	"Hey! I just saved your reputation, you know?", she whispers. "I noticed you pulled out some other files, and figured out those where coming form your ship logs, so while Danforth was giving all the other ones a bad time, I figured I would take a peek. As soon as I realized your readings where similar, I figured I could pull your ship logs from that date to see what kind of phenomenon it was. All this without peeking into your private life, I promise!"`
			`	You decide to forgive her for peeking and focus on the discussion`
			label "FW listen"
			`	You listen to the conversation, and it soon becomes apparent that the Navy is frightened by what could be on the other side. Danforth claims the Navy should ask the help of the Quarg, an idea supported by most of the officers, even though some are opposed to the idea. Eventually, the meeting ends with the decision to call in the Quarg. More specifically they ask you to go to Lagrange and ask the Quarg there for help, since, as you are an outsider to the Navy, you wouldn't be suspicious.`

			`You prepare to land with the Quarg fleet, but you notice that two of the three ships are staying in orbit to watch the system, and more specifically the forming wormhole. You finally land and the Quarg ship lands next to you.`
			`	You were pretty sure you would have been greeted by another escort, but it appears the phenomenon has become so huge that the Navy doesn't seem to see any point in hiding themselves anymore. The spaceport has become mostly a military area, with only a few landing pads left for civilians, and is being swarmed by navy staff. You go with the Quarg you talked with back in Lagrange to the field headquarters of the Navy, where you are greeted by the Navy officers and Freya who you spot analyzing live readings of the wormhole. You notice Danforth is not there, and you when you ask about it, one of the Oathkeeper officers explains to you he was on patrol with is personal flagship and is coming back as you are talking.`
			`	You then go to see Freya, but then she rushes to you.`
			`	"The wormhole is stabilizing at an accelerating rate, and at that rate, it will open in a few seconds!"`

			`	Everything next happens very quickly: You see Danforth ship entering atmosphere to land, while the Quarg ship begins to hover and prepares for final takeoff. But then, the sky illuminates, so intensely that you protect your eyes with your hands, and when you take another look, you see Danforth ship in fire, crashing. You prepare to go help him but the Oathkeeper officer you talked to a few moments grabs you:`

			`Upon entering the planet's atmosphere, the aliens make themselves clear they prefer to land away from any spaceport, in a more neutral area. During the descent, you examine their ships a bit more closely, and you notice how their design is much more pronounced towards utility than elegance. Unlike the Quarg, their ship appears a bit crude, and yet perfected in every technical aspect, making it the beast in combat that is able to take down everything that was thrown at it, except itself.`
			`	You land in a remote plain, facing each other, and as you disembark your ship, you notice republic transport ships incoming. They land next to you and disembark their VIP passengers as well, consisting in the different Navy officers, including some Oathkeeper officers and Freya. The aliens appear to have assembled a committee as well and is moving towards you. As they get close you can clearly study their physical characteristics. What surprises you first is their morphology ressembles the one of humans quite a bit: they are about your size, only a bit taller, they appear to have the exact same limb size to height ratio and their faces looks a lot more like a human than any other species you encountered. However, their skin is bluish and they seem a lot thinner than the average human.`
			`	They also brought a couple devices, one of which you recognize as some kind of translater. As they approach you, their apparent leader puts is right fist on his left shoulder and bows is head, an act you assume is a welcoming salute. He then takes a holographic capsule and switches it on, displaying many places and people of his kind, before advancing his hands towards you, as if he wanted to gift it to you.`

For an unknown reason you thought it wouldn't hurt to copy that data then and you realize you have it available right on you. You ask Freya if she has some empty storage device on her, which she doesn't, but an Oathkeeper officer who heard you hands you one before asking.`

				`This is the best chance we have at our disposition to make some peaceful contact with them!`
				`See long term: they have proven their technological advance, and their capsule may give us clues on that subject.`
			`	They discuss between themselves for a few moments, but either your arguments or their discussion, perhaps both, made them agree on your decision. So you hand over your data capsule to the alien leader who offers you in return theirs.`
			`	They then bring your capsule to the translation device, and quickly figure out how to retrieve data from it and read it faster than you'd have expected. Then for what seems to be hours, but actually turns out to be only thirty minutes, the device seems to process that data to understand the logic of your language. Then, one of the other aliens take the device and speak through it:`
			`	"Understandable enough, this sentence can appear?"`
