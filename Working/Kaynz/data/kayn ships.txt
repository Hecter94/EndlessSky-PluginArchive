	description `The Kayn Republic's "Honorbound" is a design borrowed from the Kayn Empire's "Rain Warrior", first deployed during the Great War. It was originally meant to act as an escort for their world-class ships, to engage smaller targets or serve as shield. Nowadays, they serve as flagships in patrols, or cruisers in war fleets.`
