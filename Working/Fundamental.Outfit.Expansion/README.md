The original concept for FOE's Shipwright Gear was introduced by Darcy Manoel and  [Hurleveur](https://github.com/Hurleveur) with the Shipwright Gear in [Fluff](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/res/mds/ships.md#fluff) resp. the Repair Team in [Unfettered Innovations](https://github.com/Hurleveur/unfettered-innovations). The stats are a mix-up inspired from those. The concept was extended by toolset-slots and evolved into the Hesperian Toolbox.

__Note__: Overwrites the vanilla Heavy Blaster. Justified, as the vanilla HB's lore is imho heretic to the original by 1010todd.
