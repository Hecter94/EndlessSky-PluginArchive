### Fundamental Outfit Expansion ###

**Authors:** see table

**Thanks for feedback and discussions:** AvianGeneticist, Cend, Kassandra Haruki, Keilaph, Kitteh, Questenberg, Unknown_Rawrs

**Notes**
- Other fundamental content can be found in the plugin recommendation list, especially see [Rumskib](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/rumskib) for Plasma Turrets (Single, Quad) and Gatling Turrets (Single, Triple, Quad).
- Overwrites the vanilla Heavy Blaster. Justified, as the vanilla HB's lore is imho heretic to the original by 1010todd.
- Contains the ES-wide only adaptive reactor -- Synatom's Sentinel Reactor.
- The original concept for FOE's Shipwright Gear was introduced by Darcy Manoel and  [Hurleveur](https://github.com/Hurleveur) with the Shipwright Gear in [Fluff](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/res/mds/ships.md#fluff) resp. the Repair Team in [Unfettered Innovations](https://github.com/Hurleveur/unfettered-innovations). The stats are a mix-up inspired from those. The concept was extended by toolset-slots and evolved into the Hesperian Toolbox.
