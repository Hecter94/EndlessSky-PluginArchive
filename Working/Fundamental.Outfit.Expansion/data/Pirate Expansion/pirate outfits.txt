	description "Although considered illegal by almost every government for hundred of years, slavery is still very common on pirate and anarchist planets. A slave can replace a crew member in everything but close combat, in order to avoid giving them a chance to escape. One problem with slaves is the risk of them rebelling and taking over the ship, which can be mitigated by keeping enough standard crew to stop any insurrection with force."

	"radar jamming" 9 # originally 15, which was a bit overpowered
	description "Developed as a more effective alternative to Lovelace's design, this radar jammer requires a small amount of energy to function. It is often seen in pirate warships, where combat is frequent and missiles a constant treat."

	"energy consumption" 0.9
	description "This interference emitter has similar capabilities to the interference plating, utilising outfit space more efficiently at the cost of a constant energy consumption. One of these is enough to halve the chance of a successful scan."

	"energy consumption" 1.9
	description "The larger version of the interference emitter is quite powerful, capable of stopping roughly four out of five scan attempts alone although with the same downside of its smaller brother. Often the preferred choice of smugglers, perfect for passing through high security sectors with illegal cargo."

	description "A popular, although unofficial, modification to the Javelin Pod allows it to be mounted in a rotating turret mount making it much more effective. A bit more inaccurate than the base model, it is still a powerful weapon for its size and is usually mounted in the warships that lack the space for comparable energy-based weapons."
