	description "An Engineering Room acts as a centralized control center for managing repairs and regulating the flow of energy on your ship. This can make energy usage by certain outfits more efficient while also alleviating effects that negatively impact your ship. A skilled engineering crew who understands how these systems work and interact with each other is essential to Engineering Room operations."
	description "	Engineering Rooms are also often the location where a ship's self-destruct sequence is activated. Typically it involves deliberately causing a reactor meltdown in the ship's power systems or some similar catastrophic failure. At a minimum, this usually requires the cooperation of both the captain and the engineering crew."
