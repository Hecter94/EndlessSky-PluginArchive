	description "The Thunderbolt is an externally-mounted heavy missile that does not require a launcher. Its guidance is quite primitive, but it is very persistent and difficult to shoot down, and its warhead is the largest available on the open market."
	description "	[Thunderbolt missiles are a one-shot weapon: each missile occupies a gun slot, and after it is fired, the slot it was in is left empty.]"
