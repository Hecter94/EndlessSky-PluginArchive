	description "The Meteor Missile's large warhead can spell doom for poorly-defended targets when fired in great numbers, and this multi-launcher helps with that, loading its ammunition sequentially onto a set of rails that allow a large number to be fired quickly at once."
	description "	Reloads take a long time, but the burst-fire potential allows strike-craft pilots freedom to employ hit-and-run tactics, as opposed to streadily streaming out volleys every second from a standard missile launcher."
