	description "The Hailstorm is an externally-mounted cluster missile that does not require a launcher. Seven submunitions are released at a target distance of 450. The wide distribution of near-simultaneous impacts makes it both a very potent shield-stripper and useful against small targets that can evade larger missiles."
