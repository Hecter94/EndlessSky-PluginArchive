	description "The Rapier is an externally-mounted hypervelocity missile that does not require a launcher. Bearing a large propellant fraction and an armor-piercing tandem warhead, it is capable of heavily damaging targets at incredible ranges, even through their shields."
	description "	The missile's tracking relies on an initial snapshot of the target taken at the moment of firing. While in flight, it will try to keep the initial and live images of its target lined up. While this is very reliable within typical operating timespans of under 3.5 seconds against a target that cannot turn quickly, it makes the Rapier completely useless if it misses and its target leaves its field of view. On the other hand, this simple solution keeps the costs associated with using such a powerful fire-and-forget weapon down."
	description "	[Rapier missiles are a one-shot weapon: each missile occupies a gun slot, and after it is fired, the slot it was in is left empty.]"
