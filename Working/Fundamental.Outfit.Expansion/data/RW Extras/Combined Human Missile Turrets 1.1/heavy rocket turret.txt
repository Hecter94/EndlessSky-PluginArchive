	description "An unholy mating of Lovelace's targeting systems and Delta V's heavy ordnance, this fearsome weapon mounts two Heavy Rocket pods on a turret, along with the associated loading mechanisms for two full-sized launchers. Able to reduce any small ship to a rapidly expanding cloud of debris from any azimuth with a single salvo, its capacity for destruction is offset only by its immense mass and slow traverse rate."

#		"acceleration" .8 # Disabled to make the turret's aim a lot better. While this does mean the rockets will inherit some velocity from the firing ship's vector instead of stabilizing and traveling under their own thrust, Javelins actually don't have these values either, so I suspect the only reason they're on heavy rockets is to make NPC ships miss with them more often.
