	cost 580000 # 1170000*0.5 (total cost of vanilla human scanners to match this outfit's stats, assuming the asteroid scanner cost reduction in v10.7, & rounded down)
	thumbnail "outfit/surveillance radar" # based on the radar design on the Heavy Centaur and Boreas in X3TC
	"mass" 30 # about 1/4 of the mass of an equivalent amount vanilla human scanners for its stats (10+40+60)
	"outfit space" -20 # one third of the mass is external (as with solar panels) due to the huge antenna being the main functional part of the outfit
#	"weapon capacity" -10 # even though it fits onto the physical location of weapon space, i like the idea of this not using weapon capacity so you can use spare turret hardpoints. a decent tradeoff between what i want and what i think it should have according to the game's outfit design would be to make it use 10 weapon capacity (i.e. half of the outfit space, which happens to equal the remaining third of the total mass that doesn't slot into outfit space)
	"turret mounts" -1

	description "A long-range external scanner primarily used by the Republic Navy's reconnaissance and law-enforcement arms, but commercial models are available for use on research, mining, salvage, and privateering vessels."
	description "	It has vastly greater power than standard internal scanners but not much more efficiency, allowing scans to be performed at much greater ranges but at a relatively slow rate."
	description "	This system is so bulky that it requires installation on a powered rotating turret mount."

# TODO add radar ship variants to republic navy surveillance
