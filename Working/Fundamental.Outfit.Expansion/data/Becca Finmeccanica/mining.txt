	description `A powerful tractor beam turret which truly vacuums the void from any flotsam. For rapid orientation it had to be equipped with control nozzles, pushing it into position in a second. Becca Finmeccanica is one of only two manufacturers able to produce equipment which can endure the occurring material stress.`
	description `	When Becca Finmeccanica's chief engineer Archie Mendes was asked whether he could provide a long-range high-performance attractor for the new generation of mining Behemoths, he replied "Give me a ship to stand on, and I will move planets". Just in case he was forbidden via a contract addendum 1337 to go aboard any ship as long as he works for Finmeccanica, in exchange for a generous bonus payment.`

	description `This heat ray basically melts out desired minerals from asteroids. This technology had its breakthrough only recently and is therefore more expensive than the classical mining laser, however it's significantly more effective.`
	description `	During a bath in the caldarium of the thermae in Becca Finmeccanica's main research facility, the chief engineer Achie Mendes had the inspiration that one could wash out asteroids by heat. Being overwhelmed by this spark of an idea, he jumped out without dressing, running to his laboratory nakedly and calling out "Erika! Erika!" for the company's chief technology officer. Though the work on the heat project was approved enthusiastically, contract addendum 2442 forbids Archie to use the company thermae. Instead a private office bathroom was set up.`
