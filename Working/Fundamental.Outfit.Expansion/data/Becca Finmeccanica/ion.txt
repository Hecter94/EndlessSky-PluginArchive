	description `Imagine a catapult for ball lightnings. An enormous charge of electricity is accumulated until a ion storm erupts and is hurled into the unexpecting enemy, overloading and stupifying its circuits with such force that even shields are helpless. Though actually completely unguided, the ion ball greedily strives into the next hapless target to uncharge, creating the same impression of a fierce hunt by a barely controllable beast which already haunted our ancestors millennia ago.`
	description `	The relation to scorpions is a bit far fetched. Becca Finmeccanica's Research Department was commissioned by a secret customer with the codename "The Last of the First" to design a high-velocity penetrator weapon which should cause minimal hull damage but would release a knock-out gas into the targeted ship to render the crew unconscious. This working principle was associated with scorpion stings, though the intention was of course of absolutely humane nature, namely to spare lifes. Nevertheless absurd rumours circulated around this project involving nerve gas and reptiloids.`
	description `	One way or the other, after a series of accidents with of course no deaths at all, and a rapid increase in expenditures, an internal investigation was carried out, supervised by CEO Tom Becca IX. himself. After revealing schemes of corrupt managers, the involvement of green people and tests on innocent squirrels, Becca understood how that would read in the company's annual report. After the external cleaners completed their job, the project was reassigned to chief-engineer Archie Mendes and formalized as if it has always been his. Mendes got free rule, and, well, here we are.`
