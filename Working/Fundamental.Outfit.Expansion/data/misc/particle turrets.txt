	description "The Heavy Particle Turret hammers a contrahent with such violence that even larger ships can be thrown off course. However, there is also no gun version of this weapon because there is no point to install it on smaller ships which will be rendered uncontrollable for their pilots. Mainly used by commanders who prefer to employ their capital warships as mobile battle stations."
