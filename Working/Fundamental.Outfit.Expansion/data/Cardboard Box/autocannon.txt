	description "Autocannons have continuously been developed further. This current state-of-the art model is the result of a cooperation between Delta V and the Syndicate.

	description "Named after ancient Egypt's cheetah goddess of judgment and execution, the Mafdet AC is the long-range high-precision sibling of the Sekhmet."
	description " Applying a highly classified technology derived from the railgun concept -- kept secret especially from their Syndicate business partners --, Delta V was able to accelerate projectiles with such force, that common explosive shells did break apart. Hence the Mafdet shoots armor-piercing shells with less explosives but a hardened case. Even a shield doesn't protect the target completely, as after impact the shells' splinters continue their way to the hull."

	description " Equipped with an own targeting computer, this turret not only does not need a human operator, but also allows to lead the burst-fired guided explosive shells to the target, employing the ship's sensor systems."
