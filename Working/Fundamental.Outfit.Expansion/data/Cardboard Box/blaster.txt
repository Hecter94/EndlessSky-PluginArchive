	description "The Rapidfire Blaster Turret was created for the defense of trading ships against fast flying attackers. By removing one of the barrels of a Blaster Turret, but keeping the same socket, the freed power capacities can be used to increase the fire rate, the projectile speed and turn rate, at lower space needs. The disadvantages of earlier dissipating energy bolts, lower accuracy, and stronger heat stress on the remaining barrel, most merchants willingly accept, as long as the Rapidfire keeps pirates long enough away till the next hyperjump."
