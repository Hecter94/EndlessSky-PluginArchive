	description "Named for its intended use in the Vanguards and Protectors of the Syndicated Security fleet, the revolutionary Sentinel Reactor by Synatom is an enlarged breeder reactor with a powerful adaptive liquid sodium cooling system. Even when the ship is heated up maximally the reactor still provides as much energy as a breeder, but only generates the heat of a basic fission reactor. At that the compact design reduces it's size by one third of the expected."
