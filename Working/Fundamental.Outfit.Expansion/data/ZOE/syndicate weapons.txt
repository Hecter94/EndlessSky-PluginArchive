	description "This turreted pair of Proton Guns uses some crafty engineering to allow both guns to draw from a singular enlarged projectile generator. This allows the turret mount itself to be larger, permitting the whole assembly to turn faster than other turrets of its size."
	description "	The shared projectile generator also has some quirks; namely, the generator is prone to power overdraw - a bug since rebranded by the Syndicate's advertising department as an intended feature, as the overdraw tends to yield surplus proton projectile mass, increasing damage on target."
