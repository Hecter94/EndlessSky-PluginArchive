	description "Navy ships have to deal with combat more frequent and dangerous than most civilian ships will ever see. As such, the Navy utilizes these more advanced shield generators to allow even their fighters to recover quickly."
	description "	Navy shield generators work by cycling far more power through the generator, providing an increase to space efficiency at the cost of consuming extra energy and producing heat while generating shields."
