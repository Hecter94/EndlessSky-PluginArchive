	description `For some of their most fuel hungry outfits, the Free Worlds needed a fuel pod that would be able to store more fuel on smaller ships. The Compressed Fuel Pod does just that, but it comes at the expense of a small amount of energy to run the internal pump, and is more prone to fuel leakage and other failures.`
