	description "The Plasma Howitzer is an experimental augmentation of the Plasma Cannon that uses strong magnets to bind together an oversized plasma projectile, before stuffing the projectile with a bit of hyperspace fuel and launching it. These projectiles are highly unstable, to the point where even a bare graze is enough to release the plasma explosion."
	description "	To keep the magnets cooled enough to function, the weapon must directly tap from the ship's normal cooling systems."

# PLASMA REPEATER TURRET

	description "This turret places two Plasma Repeaters on one big mount, with a creative twist: The firing clocks have been tweaked so each individual gun fires slightly faster, allowing the turret to overall more effectively saturate an area. Because of its effectiveness, the Free Worlds have restricted the sale of this weapon to its Militia only."
