### snowfeather.robotics <br>
<br>
<br>
Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>
Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>
<br>
To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>
The new buyable worker androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years. Also 6 fighting androids are added, technically they are h2h outfits (with attack/defense 2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12). To keep all androids close a new outfit category "Androids" was made.<br>
