	description `Before the Assassin was first developed, the Sentry was the best warship the Derogam had to offer. Just like most of their ships, it has been upgraded various times throughout the decades. However, it has never received a significant redesign just so it could maintain its role as a relatively cheap all-round vessel. Its primary use is escorting bigger warships, although it is often found serving various other purposes as well.`

	description `The Assassin is the Derogam's main medium warship, although it has an unusual style; it's meant to be a fast ship with high firepower to take out priority targets. It was also the first ship to test the new so-called vein technology, a very efficient system which distributes various substances around the ship in the tubes around its hull. This gives the ship some extra utility in the form of a little hull and shield regeneration, converting some heat to energy, and unusually efficient heat dissipation, enabling it to take a very large amount of heat.`

	description `The Warrior's design is, as its looks suggest, based on the Assassin; it was even the second ship to test the new vein technology to later be used by its successor, the Guardian. Since its initial model was primarily designed to serve as a versatile offensive heavy warship, the Warrior has a lot of weapon hardpoints. This enables a wide variety of weaponry, which means it can fit most roles in combat depending on its loadout.`

	description `This is the apex of Derogam warships, designed to push their limits to the edge. With the best and latest technology, including the succesful vein technology, it utilizes extreme firepower and defensive capabilities at the cost of speed. Despite being their heaviest warship, sometimes one is outfitted as a freighter if the cargo is valuable enough.`

	description `The Gatherer is designed to have high cargo capacity in reinforced pods that are quickly detachable so it can quickly move good amounts of cargo around. This unusual design means it has a relatively weak hull and makes it relatively slow, but it's a good freighter nonetheless. Its armament consists of only two turrets intended to utilize two anti-missile systems or small offensive weaponry to assist its escorts if under attack.`

	description `The Collector is designed with big reinforced detachable cargo pods to quickly load and unload cargo. Its high mobility improves its survivability and makes it a popular freighter even amongst the military; the Hoarder's sheer size makes it an easy target despite the stronger hull and shields, and the Gatherer simply lacks survivability. Its armament is relatively weak, mainly meant to keep itself and other smaller ships safe, but a small group of these still make a formidable enemy.`
