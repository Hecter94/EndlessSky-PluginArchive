	description `These two Gatling Guns have been crudely joined to fit into a single gun port, offering twice as much damage but twice the heat and power consumption, along with a little bit of extra mass. However, it still needs to cool down for twice as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`

	description `These two Gatling Guns have been crudely joined to fit into a single gun port, offering twice as much damage but twice the heat and power consumption, along with a little bit of extra mass. However, an intricate mechanism staggers the fire of the two guns. It needs to cool down for half as long as it fires, and can only sustain a maximum of three seconds of continuous fire.`
