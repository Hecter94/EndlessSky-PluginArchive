	description "Both a hyperdrive and a jump drive able to jump at any speed and a key to the most mysterious places in the galaxy, this fantastic device lets you travel wherever you want, whenever you want, and all for 1 fuel each warp! Built in cloaking means that you don't need to fight when you don't want to, and the 600 fuel generation means that you'll be regenerating that 1 fuel used per jump pretty quickly."
	description "	Perfect for any developer looking to quickly test things out or just someone who wants to visit all the systems in the game as fast as possible."
