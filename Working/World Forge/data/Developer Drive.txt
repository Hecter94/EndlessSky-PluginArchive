	description "Both a hyperdrive and a jump drive able to jump at any speed and a key to the most mysterious places in the galaxy, this fantastic device lets you travel wherever you want, whenever you want, and all for 1 fuel each warp! Built in cloaking means that you don't need to fight when you don't want to, and the 500 ramscoop means that you'll be regenerating that 1 fuel used per jump pretty quickly."
	description "Perfect for any developer looking to quickly test things out or just someone who wants to visit all the systems in the game as fast as possible."
