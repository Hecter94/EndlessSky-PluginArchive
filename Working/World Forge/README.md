# World-Forge Plugin for [Endless-Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/)
World-Forge is a plugin for content creators and developers of endless-sky, adding a few systems, which have all outfits and ships available to buy. 

Have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Wrzlprnft/world-forge/wiki) for more information and to see what this plugin is capable of.

It is not yet finished, but working.
It does support older pilots without doing harm to them, but also has a altered start for new pilots.

## I do not recommend this for playing in super sandbox mode, because the game might actually get boring using all the superweapons, but if you're into that, go ahead.

Thx Local God, LeafyGrove, Storm Crow for helping in creating and updating.
Thx to Earl Grey, from whom i basically copied and edited the swizzle change system.
Special Thanks goes to Derpy Horse, as well as the official title "Maintainer of World Forge". 
No, for real, Derpy is the reason this still exists.
