To quote Michael Zahnisers all-content-plugin:
"This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it."
World Forge does this as well, but extends this: not only all outfits in one place, but sorted by race additionally, a way to change the swizzle(derived from ProjectRunabout), a easy way to add own outfits and ships into the existing scheme, and  missions to change your reputation with factions!
