The pet project of Zoura3025: An endless sky plugin that just aims to flesh out the game with a wide variety of changes, ranging from experimental weapons to the expansion of both Human and Hai space, as well as a whole new (in-development) galaxy.

Don't use this plugin if you're looking for a highly-polished, vanilla-esque product. This is an adventure for both you and the author; one that will have ups and downs. Thanks for giving it a shot.

~Sincerely, the author, Zoura3025
