Once you've played Endless Sky a few times, the early stages of building up from your initial ship can be a little dull. This plugin gives you some alternatives for the starting character. The choices are:
- the standard starting character from the official version of Endless Sky.
- an adventurer with a good combat rating.
- an inexperienced youth with a trust fund.
- a merchant with a temporarily mislaid ship.

For the last two of these, you'll have to complete a simple mission.
