	description "A ship can run without batteries if its generator's instantaneous power output is higher than the total energy consumption of its systems, but batteries make it possible to store up energy when it is not needed and thus to use a much smaller and cheaper generator."

	description "The most powerful reactor known to humans, this reactor generates so much heat that it glows like a sun. Any attempt to reverse engineer this will not work, because the secret of it generating so much energy (and heat) is guarded by a built-in defence mechanism."
