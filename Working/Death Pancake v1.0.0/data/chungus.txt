	description "This familiar-looking battlestation piques your interest. As you look over the specs, however, it seems as if owning this has its pros and cons."
	description "To utilize this ship, you cannot use it as your flagship, as it moves at 0.01 mph. Instead, it travels system-to-system with you, serving as a stationary (ha) defense against any hostile ships in the system. Its hull and shields make sure that it can hold its own, and the Wanderer Sunbeam weapons make sure that those hostile ships don't stay around long."
	description "Since the ship doesn't move (and therefore land on a planet)s, you'll need to refuel it when it runs out of jump fuel."
	description "When the station launches, allow it some time to steady itself."
