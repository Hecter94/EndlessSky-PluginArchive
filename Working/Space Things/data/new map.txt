Low gravity, thin but breatheable atmosphere, and vast, rocky landscapes mean that all major players in the galactic ship trade have some production happening here. The only downside is its distance from galactic center. Luckily, resources from nearby systems are plentiful and well-armed convoys arrive often. `
	spaceport `The space porty is vast, with at least 100 hangars and several hundred more basic landing pads, most occupied with the latest vessels to roll off the production line.`

	description `Originally a Republic colony, the planet Reach is one of the closest solar systems to Sol. Knowing this, it is not surprise that Reach would be one of the first planets colonized by humanity. However, the planet was left unprotected and Republic law kept them from building strong enough forces to protect themselves from Pirates. This caused the colonists of Reach to revolt and create a new government: the UNSC.
	spaceport `Reach's spaceport is bustling with civilians. You see some guards patrolling the lines of ships and occasionally going aboard to check for anything illegal.'
	spaceport `The innerds of the spaceport are quite small but have plenty of business. You can tell that Reach has a great military presence, since almost every shop has a recruitment kiosk nearby. As you walk to a nearby glass wall, you can see a bustling and thriving city, laced with residental & industrial buildings. Far off you see what you can only imagine to be a military base. What goes on there leaves you wondering.`
