# ES-Andromeda
Coming eventually

## What is this?
ES Andromeda is (going to be) a plugin for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky) that expands the playable area out into the Andromeda galaxy.
Through a story that takes place in the Milky Way, the player (along with a few allies) will be able to access the Andromeda galaxy, exploring hundreds of new systems and all new alien races.
