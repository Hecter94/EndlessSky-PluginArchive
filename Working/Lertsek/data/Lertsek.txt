	description "Several years ago, while visiting a sweat lodge in search of spiritual renewal, Tarazed's chief ship designer fell into a trance and journeyed to a reality separate from our own. There he saw visions of a strange and elegant starship. Returning to his work with renewed purpose, he spent the next seven years making the Kestrel a reality."
	description `This model, however, was made by mistake, when someone accidentally mirrored the ship blueprint file before sending it. It was originally to be scrapped to build it properly, but its new design became popular among some, and its nickname "Lertsek" stuck.`
