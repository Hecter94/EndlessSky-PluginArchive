	description "With such a huge ship to worry about, one might think it a good idea to amp up the anti-missile systems of the Quaernan. The original designers of the ship seemed to agree, with these huge turrets providing not only direct anti-missile fire, but also radiator coils to reduce the ship's thermal footprint as well as radar jamming mechanisms."

	description "Though the Quaernan doesn't have many fixed gun ports, it makes the most of them with weapons like this. The weapon fires magnetized particle clumps extremely rapidly, forming a stream of dreadly projectiles that chase their targets. Seeking via magnetism, the projectiles are more effective the more massive the target is."

	description "These are the most common type of offensive weapon on the Quaernan, and it's easy to see why. They're reliably powerful, and are able to dispense projectiles over long ranges with aplomb. Aside from the colossal size, the weapon actually seems to share a fair bit of engineering with the Kraz plasma cannon."
	description "Judging by the designation, as well as the number, it's believeable to assume that these turrets are intended to heat up a target, making it more recognizeable for the Induction Missile."

	description "These appear to be somekind of plasma mortar mounted on a turret; slow to fire, but much more damaging than a Marker Turret, and with area damage to boot. Presumably, these turrets are designed to defend angles that the Rift Tearer might be too slow to fire at."

	description "If there's one thing you probably don't want to do, it's get closer to the Quaernan. That's why, despite its lack of direct damage, the Tractor Beam is so terrifying; able to reach out over extreme distances, the beam can leverage the Quaernan's sheer mass to draw its target closer to itself, pulling the target in range of more of the Quaernan's weapons."
	description "Thanks to the fact that the weapon does damage by exerting structural stresses on its target rather than more direct means, the target ship will take damage even through shields."

	description "This is the Quaernan's main gun, and it's more than just a mount for a weapon. It's a massive artillery battery with its own enormous capacitor bank, crew accomodations, and self-maintenance units built in. The guns have enormously long range, firing large swathes of charged particles that cause enormous damage upon striking something."
	description "Despite its obvious design as a self-contained system, the Rift Tearer doesn't have any power generation tech of any kind."

	description "The Induction Missile Launcher is one of the most powerful guns the Quaernan has, capable of rapidly firing a stream of fast, accurate, powerful missiles. It works in tandem with the numerous Marker Turrets on the Quaernan: their heat damage increases the likelihood an Induction Missile will retain a lock."
	description "Like the Beehive Cannon, the ship has all of the necessary internal machinery to manufacture the requisite missiles."

	description "At first glance, the Beehive Cannon might seem a little worthless, as it has no method of producing its own ammunition. You then go deeper into the Quaernan and find an entire assembly line for creating Beehive Munitions perfectly integrated into the ship, ready for operation. You need to dedicate crew to ammunition hauling, but otherwise, it's as easy as buying materials and letting the ship do its thing."
	description "The Beehive Munitions themselves are quite imposing; a thick shell that bursts into dozens of smaller units upon nearing a target. Considering the Quaernan's defenses, you can't help but wonder if they were designed explicitly to counter this weapon."
