		`As you bring the <ship> down to the alien spaceport, you count at least thirty to fourty other ships following you down from the sky. You touch down onto the landing area of the spaceport, and then shut down your engines. A few of the aliens step out of their ships--oddly human like creatures, with similarly human-like clothing, but green or black scales patch their upper arms and lower legs, and many of them are significantly taller than humans. You head for the airlock to exit the ship and confront them, but hesitate.
		choice
			`(Open the airlock door and confront the aliens.)`
				goto "Confrontation"
			`(Run back to the control panel, fire up the engines, and get the hell out of there.)`
				goto "Run"
		label "Run"
		`	You shoot over to the pilot's seat and prepare your ship to flee...`
			depart
		label "Confrontation"
		`	Hesitantly you open the airlock and exit into the musky, seemingly caustic atmosphere with your hands raised and palms facing away from you. The aliens don't appear to bear any weapons or firearms, but you still advance slowly and carefully in case any are concealed beneath their clothing. One of the aliens are waiting for you at the bottom of the airlock ramp. It is eerily silent, aside from the whirring of a distant starship engine--it begins to get to your head, and you hesitate once more. Perhaps this isn't such a good idea.`
		choice
			`(Run back into your ship and make a getaway.)`
				goto "Escape"
			`(Meet the alien at the bottom of the ramp.)`
				goto "Confrontation 2"
			`(Draw your sidearm and kill the alien.)`
				goto "Unwarranted Aggression"
		label "Escape"
		`	Surprisingly, you manage to get back up the airlock ramp and close the airlock ramp without getting shot, though you see one of the starship's weapons tracking you meanwhile. In a panic you scramble to the pilot's seat and prepare your ship to flee...`
			depart
		label "Confrontation 2"
		`	After a brief pause you continue heading down the ramp until you are face to face--well, looking up to the alien from a distance of only a few feet away, hands still up high in the air. They look at you quizzacly, and then chirp something in their own language, sounding something like "Evora Navaiya, evi arva v'di?"`
		choice
			`	"I do not understand you." (Die, because this is a test)`
			goto "die"
		label "die"
		`	You die.`
