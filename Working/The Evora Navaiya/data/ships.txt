	description "A light, inexpensive transport ship used by the Evora Navaiya to shuttle people to other worlds very quickly and avoid danger while doing so. It used to be popular as an exploration and scout ship, however, it is no longer used for such because of a pact no longer permitting any extra-territorial exploration."
