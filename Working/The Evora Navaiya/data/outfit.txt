	description "The most common weapon in Evora space, the Rapier is a powerful, small, versatile weapon commonly used on interceptors, fighters, and some light warships. They are incredible in the way that, even though the Evora haven't deployed new military technology in eons, these lasers do more than twice the damage of a standard Quarg Skylance and are less than a quarter of the size."

# Evora's generators---------------------

	"shield generation" 18
	"energy capacity" 6700
	"energy generation" 8
	"heat generation" 1.2
	description "A small multipurpose generator used by the Evora on most of their small transport and interceptor-class ships. While far more efficient than most generators of its size, the Evora's weapons and systems are so energy-efficient that they typically do not bother to employ anything larger, even in their capital ships, instead focusing on more constructive endeavors."
	description "This outfit requires an Evora Navaiya Civilian License to purchase." #Still being implemented

# Evora's engines--------------------------
		 
outfit "Spectra C-100 Thruster"

	"outfit space" -16
	"engine capacity" -16
	"thrust" 22
	"thrusting energy" 2
	"thrusting heat" 0.5
	description "Spectra thrusters are generally revered by the neighboring Doyek, whose thrusters are far less powerful for their size. These thrusters are made for interceptors and light transports."

outfit "Spectra T-100 Steering"
	category "Engines"
	cost 17500000
	thumbnail "outfit/unknown"
	"mass" 8
	"outfit space" -11
	"engine capacity" -11
	"turn" 800
	description "The smallest of the Spectra steering systems, mainly used in tiny craft like interceptors or fighters. However, due to the raw power of the Evora's engine systems most human light warships turn at the speed of a fighter with one of these equipped."

outfit "Space Rippler"
	category "Systems"
	cost 25000000
	thumbnail "outfit/jump drive"
	"mass" 16
	"outfit space" -20
	"jump drive" 1
	"jump speed" 0.1
	"jump fuel" 250
	"energy generation" -3
	"heat generation" 6
	"space rippler" 1
	description "The Space Rippler is even more enigmatic than the Jump Drive. Rumors say that the Pug may have created it and then abandoned it in a region of space where inhabitation was unlikely; though why they did so is still a mystery, and its purpose is unknown."
	description "While able to reach certain systems that an ordinary Jump Drive can't, it also consumes more fuel. It also draws power and exerts a significant amount of heat while idling."
