# The-Evora-Navaiya
This is a workspace for my mod for Endless Sky, the Evora Navaiya.

The Evora Navaiya adds two alien species to the southwest of Coalition space; the Evora Navaiya and the Doyek.
There are more spoilers belo


The Evora Navaiya are an isolated alien species, similar in structure to humans, though overall their skin tone is darker, they have colorful scales on many parts of their body, and they are much, much taller. Both males and females regularly grow in excess of eight feet tall and weigh over 500 pounds.
They live in a territory to the southwest of Coalition space but are isolated by a curious star system.

The Doyek neighbor the Evora Navaiya's isolated star system, being barely reachable from Human Space with a Jump Drive. They are a far younger species than the Evora, and not nearly as advanced. Biologically, they appear as quadruped dragon-like creatures, as if they came straight from the human world of Skymoot, but they aren't very large comparatively, only about 10 feet tall at most (with a large wingspan of about 25 feet), though they weigh in close to a ton. Unlike those Skymoot dragons though, the Doyek's intelligence is closer to the Skymoot dragons' ancestors, the Sheragi, or possibly smarter.
