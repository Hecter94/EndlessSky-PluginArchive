### hai.side.mission.unlocker
<br>
<br>
Unlocks following hai missions: Unwanted Cargo Trigger, Hiding in Plain Sight and Hai Reveal: Pirate Troubles [0]. If there are followups they work too. Also Devil-Run related systems are shown now.<br>
<br>
Currently these missions are either completely blocked or blocked after you start chapter 1 of hai reveal. This plugin fixes that.<br>
mission "Unwanted Cargo Trigger" (removed secret leaks)<br>
mission "Unwanted Cargo" (removed secret leaks)<br>
mission "Hiding in Plain Sight" (removed secret leaks & resolution)<br>
mission "Hai Reveal: Pirate Troubles [0]" (Scars Legion cut out of campaign)<br>
<br>
Also removes the hidden tag from system Devil-Run. It can be found near the core and opens the path to the Deep Space systems and the Devil-Hide system via wormhole.<br>
And removes hidden tag from "Devil-Hide" and "Al Hurr", both Hai Reveal systems.<br>
