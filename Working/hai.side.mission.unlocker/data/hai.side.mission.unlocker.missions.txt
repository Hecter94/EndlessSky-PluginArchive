The Navy estimates their numbers to be in the low thousands, mostly responsible for petty crime in the Far North and not a cause of too much trouble, but the files all date back to a number of years ago. Clearly something has changed in the time since these files were last updated if Scar's Legion is now powerful enough to even attempt to attack the Hai.`
