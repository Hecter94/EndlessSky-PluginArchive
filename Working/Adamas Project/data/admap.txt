	spaceport `The spaceport is just a few large buildings set in the center of large rings of landing pads. Large trucks carrying containers drive in every direction, driving into tunnels in the ground, where underground storage facilities are situated. Outside the landing pad rings are Adamas military garrisons, with private landing pads.`

Most of the habitation on the planet is Adamas mining facilities buried under the sand, with hatches towering up into the air, so that they are not buried.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is the only above ground structure on the entire planet, and for good reason - sand swirls wildly around the fortifications around the compound, and you continually hear the sound of rocks pelting the walls. The interior of the spaceport consists of tunnels leading underground to various different supply storehouses and quarters for the complex workers.`

It is both the diplomatic, cultural, and manufacturing capital of its region Adamas space, and houses over twenty billion Adamas. Many 'recycling' plants are visible from orbit, factories where Adamas corpses are broken down into raw material, then refined into weapons and machines.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is filled with autonomous vehicles loading and unloading cargo from Adamas freighters. You are made to land on the east side of the spaceport, called the Foreigner's District. The spaceport spreads out to three directions of you, in a seemingly perfect grid of buildings and landing pads. Signs in clear human writing tell what each building is. Directly across the street from your landing pad is a large 'Human Museum,' featuring countless human collectables from a millenia ago.`

	description `Crozonite is a planet comprised of two different types of land: sand and rock. Valleys of sand cover most of the planet, frequently rent with massive canyons and colossal mountains. The main industry here is mining, because the mountains are filled with valuable ore, although some hunting is done here, too.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is a double ring of landing pads around a mountain, with mostly-vertical elevators leading up to the mining outpost on top. From the observation deck on one of the buildings, all you can see in any direction is sand, swirling endlessly, and a single mountain standing on the horizon. The noise from the drills, even though they are deep underground, is deafening, and some kind of visible gas rises from the mining shafts.`

	description `Dolthtleh guards the sole entry to Adamas space, the Remembrance Vortex, as it is called by the Adamas. Because only one Adamas planet is suitable for agriculture, Dolthtleh was designed to hold massive districts of farmland, growing a highly adaptable food crop, which is distributed across all Adamas space. So much waste is produced and dumped, from the reactors powering the station, and from the abundant animals raised here, that the station has its own small moon orbiting it, made up entirely of this waste, and any space rocks that attempt to hit the station.`
	spaceport `The station's docking bays are located on the interior of its semi-circular shape, in hexagonal patterns. Ships that dock in them are tethered to each of the twelve vertices of the hexagon. The station is made of metal and crystal that is referred to by the Adamas as "recycled" metal and crystal - the biological metal and crystal which grows on Adamas, after the bodies of the dead have been melted down. This allows them to create larger and more durable structures, while saving the room which cemetaries would otherwise take up.`
