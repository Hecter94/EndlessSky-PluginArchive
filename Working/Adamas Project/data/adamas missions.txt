			`This station is filled with a strange kind of humanoid alien. They are of all different sizes, but all closely resemble humans, with one major difference: they are made of a metallic substance with strange, multicolored crystals running through them. As soon as you land, a very tall, thin alien with pronounced ribs moves quickly to you.`
			`	"On fen tlagn," it says, in a high, metallic voice, similar to the voice of the old human androids, before they were banned. "On fen kthest?" Seeing that it is making no progress in communicating with you, it shakes its head and says emphatically, "Quadol Nes'el Thoest," then walks away.`
