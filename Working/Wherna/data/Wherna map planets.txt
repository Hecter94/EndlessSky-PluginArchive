planet Tsaradian
	landscape land/badlands1
	description "This planet was considered to be the first planet the Wherna lived on. However, nobody really knows, and as most Wherna live on this planet, it is only considered such because the majority of Wherna here like to prove that their planet is best."
	description "Mining has improved this planet, as the considerable valuable astroids form precious deposits. Many Wherna are on the steep, dirty stairs down to the station, where a ship will take them to the city."
	spaceport "The spaceport is on the top of the highest mountain, rendering it visible from space. This also makes it subject to possible bombing, if an enemy happened along. The view from the spaceport is breathtaking, as many mountains, rocks and vegetation spread out below. Tsaradian's twin suns light this planet well."
	spaceport "Many captains are landing and taking off, and occasionally two ships will crash. Many other Wherna watch this as they wait for their ships or wait for refueling."

planet Tsadonless
	landscape land/forest3
	description "This is a popular tourist destination, but only because it has many warm springs, heated by deposits of molten gold, and the Wherna have found a way to extract it."
	description "The majority of Wherna on this planet live in solitude, among the strange flimsy plants, many of which have strange flowers of various shapes and sizes."
	spaceport "The spaceport is the fanciest one in Wherna space, since it is made of solid gold, although it is very dusty. Many captains are trading other metals for gold, where they will ship them to other planets."
	spaceport "The spaceport is dark and dirty, and the landing pads are few and cracked. Apparently, the Wherna government has given up on this planet, and the although buildings around most spaceports are terrible, buildings such as the ones here are rarely seen anywhere."

planet Horndom
	landscape land/forest3
	attributes "requires: heatlining"
	description "Broiling hot, this star is only suitable for ships to drift in, since many have attempted to land."
	description "Many strange light creatures are darting around in the extreme heat, which, even through the protective lining of your ship stops it, are trying to knaw on it. You are lucky that Sesilani only sent you here once."
	spaceport "The extreme heat and light on this planet hits you emergency ranscoop with such force that your fuel gauge jumps to the top, and you shield your ranscoop to avoid blowing your ship up."


planet Varnoka
	landscape land/snow0
	description "A snowy planet such as Varnoka is rare. Most planets usually have some amount of snow somewhere, but it looks as if all the snow in the universe was dumped right here, for no apparent reason then to make life miserable for the Wherna on Varnoka. Snowstorms frequently decimate every city, meaning many Wherna have moved instead to Wernoka, which, being so close and not as cold, is pleasanter to live on."
	description "The houses on this planet, if you could call them houses, are very sturdy and most of them have been around since at least 2912. They resemble from the air giant beehives, dumped on the surface of the never-melting snow."
	spaceport "Many Wherna have often questioned whether a spaceport is any use if you can't find it, and though the government hasn't given up on Varnoka yet, it is very probable that it soon will. The spaceport is mostly hidden under the snow, and snowstorms always cover it completely. Fortunately, a ship is employed in using its thrusters to remelt the snow as soon as possible after each snowstorm."

planet Wernoka
	landscape land/valley5
	description "Wernoka is the twin planet of Varnoka, and although warmer is still very cold. Many of the brightly colored salts on this planet form mines, where the salts are mined, and all of the Wherna wear spacesuits to protect them from the poisoness air."
	spaceport "The spaceport is brightly colored from the said salts, and it doesn't carry many ships-it only has docking for a few hundred Wherna. Unfortunately, the spaceport is shrinking each year because of the Wherna who take bits of it for antiques."

planet Roknos
	landscape land/badlands10
	description "This planet is covered in clouds of mist which do not blow away, but simply hang in the air. The gravity is low enough that if you jumped, you would most likely never come down again. The pressure, also, is unbearable, and the Rathalan's antigravity plates are weak enough that if they landed on any other planet they would be unable to take of again. Roknos was discovered by the Rathalan fleeing the Korath, and they have learned some of their unspeakable techniques, which's evidence is sprawled across Roknos."
	spaceport "The spaceport has refuse lying about everywhere, the smell is unbearable and weeping of captured Wherna echos through it. The spaceport itself is the only small one in Daroke space, and it only provides landing for close to a hundred Rathalan."

planet Jurnuri
	landscape land/sky8
	description "Jurnuri is a watery world, with rivers constantly flowing into the never-evaporating sea. The gas planet is slowly sending water through space to land Jururni. The astroids in this systems are only minables, as the astroids have been disolving for years under the steady onslaught of water that wears them down."
	spaceport "Jurnuri's spaceport is underwater, in a giant glass dome. This dome is rasied and lowered on pistons beneath and above the sea, which isn't salty, unlike most oceans. The dome slides open and closed to allow ships to enter or to forbid them from doing so."

planet Hilana
	landscape land/mountain41
	description "Hilana is a rocky, mountain world. The original inhabitants, the Rathalan, have been driven off. Even so, walking through Hilana someone might find some remains murdered in an unspeakable way."
	spaceport "Most visitors, on landing, ask where the spaceport actually is. The Wherna government has seen trillions of credits on Hilana's spaceport, yet the spaceport is rather bare and ordinary, making you wonder how much other, more lavish spaceports cost."

planet Torna
	landscape land/sky11
	description "This planet has an inspiring view at nighttime, as millions of shooting stars roar across the sky. Unfortunately, night only comes every six human years, and so its not very often that you get to view this wonder."
	spaceport "The spaceport has many, tall pillars with polished gems perched on top. A giant domed roof often appears and fades, foretelling the sequence of the moon that night-if night came."

planet Fornata
	landscape land/fog4
	description "A foggy, rocky world, Fornata's only tourist view is its precious ores. Many tourists claim they have seen ores that glowed, many different colors scattering and shifting. This report is undoubtedly false, yet the ores are very colorful."
	spaceport "Tilted on a cliff, some more superstitious Wherna claim that it will fall of some day. The violent south winds often do tilt it, but many supports underneath hold it up, thus giving no reason to fear."

planet Disna
	landscape land/beach8-sfiera
	description "Warm and sunny, Disna is a good planet for the Wherna weary of Varnoka's snowy attacks. However, the Rathalan make frequent raids here, rendering this planet dangerous. This system is a favorate vacation destionation for those overburdened with snow."
	spaceport "Pearched on the top of some strange plants on the seashore, you notice that most Wherna spaceports are on top of something. The Wherna seem to have a head for heights."

planet "Cardan"
	landscape land/desert7
	description "Cardan is hot, and its many rolling hills of rock can be very confusing to those unaware of the volcanic action beneath. As well as being heated by the huge sun, Cardan is also heated by the lava beneath, providing a broiling planet. The ovens here are made of element that takes heat and intensifies it, providing a burning hot surface."
	spaceport "The spaceport is one of the few buildings built on solid rock, its sides looking something like a normal building. However, the scale is about ten times larger."

planet Durna
	landscape land/water13
	description "Durna is a planet a few systems from any other, and the shipyard here doesn't have any other ships other then the Lasini, which only has one jump, and the Hurnisia. Therefore its ships are unable to get to any system except Hulaina. Therefore, the Wherna here have to depend on the supply fleets that come here every few months, as Durna's soil isn't fertile at all. Frequent raids from the Rathalan mean that the food is often short."
	spaceport "Many of the Wherna in the spaceport are lean, sullen and eye you meanly. You would not want to find yourself in a spaceport like this one if you ever forget your sidearm."

planet Kacka
	landscape land/fog1
	description "The Dorsa are probably kin to the Rathalan, but their complexion is darker and their planet cleaner. However, though the planet is such, the Dorsa are not. They don't get enough food or water, and therefore have to have survived by bullying other Dorsa smaller that themselves. They eye your sidearm rather nervously, and in self-defense you always point it as soon as you step off your ship. Many are small from their species, and many of the Dorsa are fighting in the confines of the crowded planet."
	spaceport "Dirty and always packed, this might have been painted once-but that was long enough ago that nobody remembers what color it was, or where the paint is. Its ceiling is low, and you almost bump your head after getting out of the hanger. Evidently it was build for the smaller Dorsa instead of humans."
