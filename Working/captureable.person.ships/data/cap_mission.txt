			`captureable.person.ships disables the old person ships, and creates nearly identically new ones. This is done because of the heavy problems with modifying npc/fleets. Anyways, just the names got changed. They have a "(C)" behind their names. So persons ships killed prior installing this plugin got re-added. The maximal spawn time, for a person ship in the system you are in, is 10 minutes.`
