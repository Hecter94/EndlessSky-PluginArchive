			`captureable.person.ships disables the old person ships, and creates nearly identical new ones. This is done because of the heavy problems with modifying npc/fleets. Anyways, just the names got changed. They have a "(C)" behind their names. So persons ships killed prior installing this plugin got re-added. The maximum spawn time, for a person ship in the system you are in, is 10 minutes.`

Just thinking about that evening in the bar on Starcross makes my blood boil. Well, the matter is now settled. Enclosed is a token of my appreciation. I wish you all the best. Kind regards, Captain Zuckung"`
