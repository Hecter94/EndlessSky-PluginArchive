	description `This module takes advantage of a fast-spinning wheel of a dense and durable alloy, suspended by electromagnetic bearings. By rotating the way the gyroscope faces on its gimbal, the wheel transfers some of its momentum to the ship, producing a turning force, without the need for thrusters.`
	description `	The motor used to spin the gyroscope also acts as a generator, able to both take energy out of the system and put energy into the system. It isn't allowed to take energy beyond a certain percent, as to save some speed to turn, but it can act as a battery when needed.
	description `	CMG Gyroscopes require an input of energy at all times, to power their electromagnetic bearings.`


#To store kinetic energy as a flywheel, and to produce torque. The motor that spins the gyroscope can either consume electricity to increase the gyroscope's speed, or resist that spin to return electricity, essentially making this function as a battery.`
#	description `Its second use is to produce torque. The entire module is mounted on a gimbal, which it can rotate to transfer some of the gyroscope's rotational energy to the ship, allowing the ship to rotate without the need for conventional thrusters.`

	description `Instead of using chemicals to store power, electricity can instead by converted to and from kinetic energy and stored in two conversely rotating flywheels. They consist of a reinforced, very dense metal inside a vacuum chamber, and suspended with magnetic bearings. Energy can be extracted using its internal motor-generator to generate a current by taking away rotational energy, or to use electricity to add rotational energy.`
