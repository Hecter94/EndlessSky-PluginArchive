			`Offers a mission to install a combat AI, which increases your ship stats based on combat experience.`
			``
			`You can get the mission to install the AI on any human planet.`
			`Every 3,000 combat xp you can choose between 8 basic updates, every 7,000 between 10 advanced updates, and every 11,000 between 14 special updates.`
			`Some updates have max ranks and others can get raised infinitely. These updates are done by adding invisible outfits with stats to the ship.`
			`If you change your ship or lose the unique combat AI outfit, a restoring mission installs everything that has been lost on the (new) ship.`
			`Some mechanics and ideas are inspired by Zoura's excellent plugin "Tales of Apoxys DX" . My plugin is less complex, doesn't need a fresh start, and is more flexible.`
