Apparently those people are in charge of maintaining the local spaceport, because no effort has been made to cleanse the pungent smell of animal from the halls and loading bays. Although it might also be due to the futility of the effort, with hundreds of head of cattle being moved through the port every day.`

You wonder if they have to import any food, or if they're completely self-sustained.`

	description `It wasn't easy to spot the small, heavily armed station orbiting around Proseon's tiny outer planet. It's covered with a custom cladding that absorbs electromagnetic waves, including visible light and radio frequencies, making it nearly radar-proofed and nearly invisible against the blackness of space. Only through occlusion or contact with one of their disguised radio beacons can the station be found. On top of that, the system's dense asteroid swarm defends it against unwanted intrusion or large-scale attack. Tethys is practically unassailable, making the pirates who inhabit it a power in their own right. Plundered cargo and stolen ships rest in the various docking bays, awaiting resale, ransom, or use.`
	spaceport `Every laborer in the Tethys port is wearing a steel helmet that covers their entire head and face, only allowing them to see out of a small, darkened glass slit. The weight and inconvenience of it appears to dramatically reduce reaction speed and situational awareness, and none of the laborers will stop to talk to you. Eventually you get a passing pirate captain to explain to you that the laborers are all serving at the pleasure of the station, until someone can pay their "ransom." Reading between the lines, those are slaves available for purchase. How wonderfully unpleasant.`

Besides, your little show in orbit lends credence to what would normally be insane ramblings. What's different about your reality?"`

				`"Well, the key thing seems to be that all your hyperspace links are gone. Ours go all over half the galaxy!"`

			`Karlsson looks at you quizzically. "Eight hundred years ago, we were barely outside of Earth. The first hyperspace drives were tested and a resounding success. Early recon indicated that there was a web of connections that would let us spread across the entire galaxy. The future was looking bright, but humans weren't the only ones with plans. Some sort of war had broken out far over our heads, starships were fighting with weapons we still don't understand. Whatever they were using, it destroyed that web, leaving only little pockets behind. Suddenly, our grand universe was cut down to seven habitable planets and a couple moons. This is taught to every schoolchild. Clearly, you do not share our history."`
			choice
				`"Who was fighting? Was it the Quarg?"`
			`"I don't know who the Quarg are. There seemed to be two factions. One had massive blue and black ships that looked almost like Terran plankton, which were few but powerful. The other had thin, yellow ships with massive barbs and fired electric discharges across space. Very few eyewitnesses saw them fight and survived to report their findings. I think as a species we just have to be thankful that they never chose to fight in Swol system." You notice that his pronunciation of 'Sol' is slightly different, but you can't imagine he's referring to anywhere other than the birthplace of humanity.`
			choice
				`"Listen, it's clear we're both over our heads. Do you have a science institute you could refer me to?"`
			`"Of course. I'll have you and yours registered in our system as 'Admiralty adjuncts' before you lift off, that'll prevent others from accosting you. If it's possible, I'd like to ask you to not use that special drive of yours while in our space, at least until these mysteries are resolved. You'll need to travel to Unified Maria, and look up Hector Colburn of the Maria Institute of Technology."`

I knew it. This is amazing. See, I did the analysis on the graviton transmitters you found, and they're... surprisingly crude. How could a race as powerful as the Pug manage to fall short like this? Questions for another day." You've never fully explained the capabilities of the Pug to Colburn or any member of the League. Another thing read directly from your computer core. This man really needs to learn how to respect a captain's privacy. "...so anyway we've loaded your ship with an improved version we fabricated. Use that jump drive of yours to the first planet of the Kuogel system, spin it up, and, uh, maybe stand behind something shielded." You look at your cargo screen and see that, indeed, a large device has been loaded and secured without your permission. Dammit Colburn...`

			`After sealing yourself into a suit and hauling the huge, unwieldy pieces of equipment out of your ship onto the desolate, sandy wasteland of Kuogel A (and putting them together with the instructions uploaded to your ship's computer), you're left facing a big, red button labeled "Push me." Well, nothing ventured... you punch the button and run for cover, closing your ship's hatch behind you and powering shields to full.`

				`(watch through the monitors)`
			`You watch the huge device as it activates itself, rumbling ominously, lights flashing on and off seemingly at random. The entire planet starts to shake and you're about to start an emergency takeoff when the tremors suddenly stop. There's a happy "ding" noise over your radio and the device's lights are all glowing bright green. Huh.`
			choice
				`(check your navigation computer)`
			`Your nav system confirms that not only was the universe not destroyed by the device, but that two new hyperspace links have come into existence, connecting the Kuogel system to other parts of the alternate galaxy. Which means that regular hyperdrives can now be used to travel to and from two groups of humanity in alternate realities. You're certain that won't damage the fabric of existence. Probably. It'd be best to go and report the success to Councillor Traft. Colburn can hire a regular courier to pick up his hunk of science.`

			`Your ship settles into you assigned landing cavern, where a well-maintained Argosy is being prepped for takeoff in the next landing pad over. Councillor Traft is waiting for you to disembark, supervising the crew performing double- and triple-checks on the Argosy. She turns as you exit the hatch of the <ship>. "Ah, Captain <last>. Are you ready to make more history? Professor Colburn's sensors say the device worked, and I've been appointed to be our first ambassador to your half of humanity. Everything we need for an embassy is already loaded and ready to go."`

			`As soon as the Nimble Mongoose drops out of hyperspace into Earth space, they begin rapid diplomatic communications with Earth. The only member of Parliament initially willing to listen is initially skeptical but selections of your ship's automated logs are enough to warrant a meeting at the very least.
			`	When you land, an honor guard just large enough to not be an insult to foreign dignitaries is waiting, standing at attention where the Mongoose's passengers will be debarking. A pair of staffers are waiting by <ship>'s ramp for you. They go over your ID and your ship's registry with a close eye for any hint of criminal activity before leading you to where now-Ambassador Traft is shaking hands with a member of Parliament in front of media camera drones. The news is already starting to spread about the existence of an alternate universe and the residents therein.
			`	When the photos stop flashing for a moment, Traft turns to you with a genuine smile on her face. She shakes your hand and slips you a credchip at the same time, before you walk back to your ship to let the politicians do their thing. Your part of this story may be completed, but today you've shaped how billions of lives will be led. Settling back into your ship, you slide the credchip into a terminal, and are pleasantly surprised by the contained amount: Two million, five hundred thousand credits. If nothing else, Traft was certainly good for payment.

event "learn alt history"
	planet Tinkour
		description `Tinkour's economy is based heavily on exporting refined industrial goods, which contrasts with the amount of time and space you see being spent on local food production and sustainability. It seems that the quality metal deposits of the planet were depleted over a century ago, leading to a dramatic retooling of infrastructure from supplying the industrial yards to remaining as self-sufficient as possible, to prevent economic collapse.`
	planet "Unified Maria"
		description `With no capacity for food growth and very poor raw materials, the only valuable thing that can come out of Terra's moon is the people living there. They took that as a challenge, and created the greatest educational institute in either your reality or this one. Despite having only a fraction of the population, the minds on Unified Maria have nearly kept pace with the technological advancement of your home reality. Among all the hab-cities of the planet, its widely regarded that the Maria Institue of Technology is the most prestigious.`
	planet Reliquary
		description `Reliquary may be marginally habitable at best, but that doesn't stop the locals from making the best of it. Hardy crops with surprising medicinal qualities are grown in the harsh soil, and several quality hospitals are found here, especially physical therapy clinincs for patients adjusting to or unwilling to get prosthetics.`
		description `	Smooth stone buildings are the norm, often painted with geometric shapes that trick the eye and make them seem to be physically impossible, in a fashion known as Escherism.`
	planet "Kraken, LLC"
		description `As an independently owned and operated space facility, Kraken is not only the largest producer of deuterium, but also the largest producer of recreational narcotics. The local black markets have plenty of designer drugs and party chems, but no dangerous weaponry or human trafficking, to avoid giving the police a worthwhile reason to cut through the red tape protecting corporate property.`
	planet Terra
		description `Terra is the greatest failure of resource management and social planning to date. The population boomed unrestricted, consuming the planet's once-rich resources and natural ecosystem, turning it into a barren cityscape, forced to import thousands of tons of food each month with no exports to speak of. Poverty is rampant, public health is terrible, and crime is a plague. The entire planet seems to be on the verge of collapse, the victim of the population's rapacity.`
	planet Hearth
		description `Hearth was the second world terraformed by humanity, after Mars, and the terraforming was focused on turning the pleasant world into a perfect one. Of course, five hundred years of society on a nearly perfect planet led to rather lax attitudes toward clothing. By and large, people decided that it wasn't particularly necessary to dress themselves on a planet with pleasant temperatures and almost no dangerous weather across the entire planet. Visitors mostly wear whatever they're most used to, so you're not pressured to go nude yourself.`
	planet New Olympus
		description `The first attempt at settling New Olympus through domed hab-cities like those on Unified Maria failed catastrophically after an unexpected dust storm destroyed irreplaceable equipment, leaving hundreds of colonists dead. The second, more successful, attempt involved burrowing into the rough planet itself, hollowing out vast tunnel structures, and pumping oxygen into those. Billions of people now live under the dry, desolate surface. Once possible, terraforming seemed unnecessary after the expense of the tunnels had already been paid for.'
		description `	New Olympus is now the de facto center of human government. Most important officials live and meet here, and the bureaucracy is centered in the deeper tunnels. While many official aspects of government have to take place on Earth due to ancient law and custom, the pollution and poverty of the human homeworld resulted in most of the wealthy and influential moving to more pleasant worlds.`
	planet Alda
		description `The rich metal veins of Alda are set to good use across the entire planet. Careful alloying and good architecture allows cities to be built across Alda's natural canyons, creating massive wind tunnels that are harvested for power by turbines built on the canyon floor. Several amusement companies that cater to daredevils feature shuttle rides through the turbines, carefully timed and measured to prevent any real danger to the passengers.`
	planet Mercurius
		description `Mercurius is largely pastoral, livestock being raised according to ancient custom. There are only a hundred or so different clans on Mercurius, and between them they own nearly the entire planet. Many of the families here are very secretive about their methods, but they produce excellent meat, real leather, and other animal products in enough quantity that nobody inquires too closely. According to a popular myth, cows outnumber humans on Mercurius ten to one.`
