outfit "Small EM Battery"
	cost 100000

outfit "Large EM Battery"
	description "This is a massive superconductive coil, capable of storing large amounts of energy in an electromagnetic field and discharging all of it in a fraction of a second. The magnetic field also provides a small boost to the shield regeneration of the ship."
	cost 750000
	"energy capacity" 62500

outfit "Small Hybrid Cooling"
	cost 180000

outfit "Fusion Drive"
	licenses
		"Sheragi Capital"
	description "The Sheragi engines are much more than simple tubes spewing fire; they are a collection of interdependent devices, providing increased efficiency at the cost of modularity. These include a hyperdrive, an enormous fusion reactor, and the most powerful plasma engines you've ever seen. It's all examples of relatively simple technology, but they have been refined and taken to their extreme. The engines are fundamentally connected to the fusion reactor, increasing their thrust even further and thereby allowing the Sheragi capital ships to fly at impressive speeds, traveling through interstellar space with relative ease."
	cost 40000000

outfit "Particle Waveform Turret"
	cost 1450000
	"mass" 45
	"outfit space" -45
	"weapon capacity" -45
	weapon
		"shield damage" 120
		"hull damage" 300
	description "This ancient Sheragi turret accelerates a dense packet of electrons that, while very ineffective against any kind of shielding, has a very long range and disrupts electrical systems. By the nature of these weapons, one can deduce that their tactics likely involved using large spinal-mounted weapons at long range to break the enemy shields and finishing them off at relatively close range with the Particle Waveform Turrets."
