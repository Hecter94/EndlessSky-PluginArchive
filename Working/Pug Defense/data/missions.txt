			`A great beacon of light, harmless radiation, radio waves, and every other form of long-distance communication your ship can detect are originating from an athmoshepre-less asteroid, near the edge of the nova from this system's unusual sextinary star system. Whatever it is leading you towards, it certainly cannot be natural, and most likely, neither are the positions of those stars.`
