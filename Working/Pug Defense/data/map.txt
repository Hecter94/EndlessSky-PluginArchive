	description `This ringworld seems to be completely abandoned, with it only caretakers being what appears to be roughly elephant sized metallic grey blobs oozing around like slugs, in their wake the floors and walls they glide upon seem to be cleaner and polished. They don't seem to be hostile, though you feel like you shouldn't try to do anything rash with them around. No traces of the previous occupents seem to be present, except for the shipyard, no matter where you look; though you could easily spend decades exploring due to the sheer immensity of the ringworld.`
	spaceport `The oddest thing about those blobs is made clear in the shipyard, where they continously and seemingly quite randomly disolve and reform into various Pug ships and outfits. As you approach, you get a strange feeling that they'd accept credits in exchange for some of their ships and outfits if you provided a fair price. Where that feeling came from, you have no clue.`
