Pug Defense is a small but extremely challenging plugin which adds a system to the south of the galaxy, accessible only by jump drive. In the system, corrupted pug fleets will spawn, extremely hostile and after your blood, however, should you be strong enough, you can challenge the planets and demand tribute. The defenders are like nothing you've ever seen before, including the peak of Pug technology, the Pug Perfecta.

To access the plugin content, first land on any planet to initialize the missions. Then go to the Sard system and jump south from there to a new system, Sylansia Lost. From there, landing on Monolith will begin the quest chain.
