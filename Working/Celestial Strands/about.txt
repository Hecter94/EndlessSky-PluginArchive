Celestial Strands by Saugia
This is a plug-in for Endless Sky that adds a new area of content based on the original Escape Velocity games, primarily Escape Velocity: Override. Currently early in-progress - please back up your save first.
To test the new content, you can either create a new pilot and select the Celestial Strands option, or visit the Horizo system that can be found near The Rim.
