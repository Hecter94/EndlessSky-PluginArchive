	description "The Tanager is a new model of transport ship from Tarazed Shipyards. More nimble compared to models of shuttlecraft from Betelgeuse, it is also supplemented with a greater capacity for defensive armaments; a necessity in the region of space that surrounds Tarazed."
	description "	The Tanager also comes with a decent amount of free space, allowing for a much greater level of customization."
