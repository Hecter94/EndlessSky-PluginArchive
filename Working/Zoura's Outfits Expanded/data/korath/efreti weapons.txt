	description "With the Quarg watching over them, the Efreti rarely endeavor to enhance their weapon technology. However, with occasional Mereti raids, some Kor Efreti have retooled the Grab-Strike to produce a powerful repulsive effect, allowing a ship to swiftly force attacking Mereti ships far from important vessels."
	description "	Sneakily, the Efreti have tooled this weapon in such a way that it has a small amount of damage potential even through shields due to how it interacts with ship masses."
