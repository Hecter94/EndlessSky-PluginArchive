	description "Inspired by the Wanderers' knowledge of biotechnology, the Mereti Collective has begun attempting to incorporate biotechnology into their usual ship systems. Among the first of these results is the Biothermal Cell, which uses extremophile colonies to operate at higher tempratures than a standard Biochemical Cell, allowing the cell to double as a heat sink."
	description "	On ships with particularly good heat dissipation systems, the heat capacity provided by the cell might just outweigh its running heat."

	description "This larger Biothermal Cell is more efficient and more powerful than its smaller brother, but is quite large by Wanderer standards. However, its heat absorption effect is quite potent on ships with good dissipation characteristics."

	description "The Model 512 is effectively a perfect ring of turrets, meaning positioning is far more important than the ship's exact orientation. This modified Korath engine system was designed solely for the largest Mereti warships, allowing even the heaviest vessel to carefully position itself as needed."
