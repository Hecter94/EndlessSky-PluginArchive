	description "Like a standard plasma core, this reactor relies on fusion. However, in times of dire speed or energy need, the ship carrying the device can dump hyperspace fuel into the reactor, providing extra medium to fuse before providing a large surge of thrust."

	description "The augmentations made to this Korath reactor allow it to be toggled to a higher gear by dumping extra hyperspace fuel in to fuse, resulting in a far greater level of output. Because the modifications affect the reactor's size so greatly, the Korath don't make a triple variant of this design."
