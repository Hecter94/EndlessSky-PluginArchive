	description "To ensure the large swarms of Kor Sestor fighters are able to return to their carrier for ammunition top-ups as needed, the Kor Sestor developed this large-scale ammunition storage system. With some crafty engineering, Piercer missiles can be cycled in and out of the ship's cargo bay, allowing Kor Sestor warships to make use of their moderately large cargo capacities for extra Piercer storage."

	description "Developed with Kor Sestor fighters in mind, the Piercer Pod is a smaller implementation of the Piercer Launcher found on Kor Sestor warships. While its fire rate isn't the greatest, when paired with a carrier with particularly large Piercer reserves, fighters equipped with these pods are able to deal considerable damage for extended periods of time."

	description "The Sestor Federation never figured out offensive beam technology by the time their war ended, but saw limited success with defensive beams that could burn through the Mereti Collective's minefields with ruthless effectiveness. These large anti-missile systems struggle to fit on most ships, but the effect on target is something to admire."

	description "Four thermal repeaters on one mount posed a significant logistical challenge to the Sestor Federation; the sheer heat produced in one firing cycle nearly melts the turret base. However, the resultant damage output is impossible to scoff at."
