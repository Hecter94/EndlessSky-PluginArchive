	description `The fighters the Korath fielded during their invasion of Bunrodea space lead to a need for powerful anti-area weapons. Formed of a tightly compacted nanite stream around small packets of motion-activated explosive, this weapon is incapable of damaging shields, but the nanite "blades" used in the area effect make it capable of shredding hull directly.`
	description `	Sadly, the weapon came too late to make an appreciable difference in the war; however, its powerful AOE strike means it will have no trouble against fighters when the time comes.`
