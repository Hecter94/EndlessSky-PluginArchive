	description `The fighters the Korath fielded during their invasion of Bunrodea space created the need for a powerful area denial weapon systems for the Bunrodean defenders. Formed of a tightly compacted nanite stream around small packets of motion-activated explosive, the Elytra Razor's nanite "blades" gives it the capability to bypass shields and shred a ship's hull directly.`
	description `	Unfortunately, the weapon came too late to make an appreciable difference in the war; however, its powerful AOE strike means it will have no trouble against fighters when the time comes.`
