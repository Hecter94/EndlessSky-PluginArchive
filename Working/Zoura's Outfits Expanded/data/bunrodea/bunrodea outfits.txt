	description "Bunrodean ramscooping technology isn't notably efficient, but it does allow ships using newly developed afterburners to replenish the small amounts of fuel they use in flight. The small size also allows small ships like fighters to store just enough fuel to make use of these afterburners, while not requiring space for a full fuel system."

	description "For their larger ships, the Bunrodea developed this larger Adaptive Engine set instead of forcing captains to just install more of the smaller model. Like its smaller cousin, this engine set possesses an extreme amount of customization potential; so much, in fact, that most Bunrodea ships can't use it."
