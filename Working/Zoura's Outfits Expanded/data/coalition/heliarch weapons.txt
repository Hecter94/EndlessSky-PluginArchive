	description `The popularity of "clip-on" pods in the Coalition's mercantile sectors have led the Heliarchs to adapt such technology for themselves. Though they couldn't make a workable turreted version, this socketed version of the Ion Rain Gun allows Heliarch ships to carry more equipment and gunnery, at the cost of cooling efficiency and imbalancing the mass of the ship.`

	description `This is a heavier, more powerful version of the Ion Rain Gun, developed by the Heliarchs in the event that a large scale riot by the civilian populace breaks out. In addition to stunning enemy ships in a wide area in front of the weapon, it also includes an ancillary shield matrix that recharges with each shot, allowing any Heliarch ship with one (or more) installed to resist greater punishment until reinforcements can arrive.`
	description `	As a response to outcry over the development of more powerful weaponry that could be fielded against civilians, the lethal effects of the weapon (particularly against the hulls of ships) have been significantly reduced.`
