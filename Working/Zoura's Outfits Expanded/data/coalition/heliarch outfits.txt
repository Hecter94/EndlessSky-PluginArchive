	description "Building on their fuel-efficient thruster design, the heliarchs designed this tiny thruster to rely on fuel to produce a much greater kick, while also being small enough to slot into fighters. To the end of allowing it to fit comfortably on fighters, it also contains a small reserve of fuel for emergency use."
