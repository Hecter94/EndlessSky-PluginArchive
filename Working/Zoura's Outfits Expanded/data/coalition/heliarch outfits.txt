	description "This is a piece of Heliarch shield modification technology removed from its original shield generator. It causes shields to draw greater amounts of energy and produce more heat - even while idle - but it makes up for these costs by allowing any ship to increase its shield generators' performance."

	description "Building on their fuel-efficient thruster design, the Heliarchs designed this tiny, fuel reliant thruster that produce a much greater thrusting force than standard Coalition engines. To the end of allowing it to fit comfortably on fighters, it also contains a small reserve of fuel for emergency use."
