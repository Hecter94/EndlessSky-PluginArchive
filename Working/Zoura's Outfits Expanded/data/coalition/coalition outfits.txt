	description `With nothing to use their ships' turret mounts on in peacetime, all the species of the Coalition have developed their own "clip-on" pods, using the turret floor as a base. The Saryds developed this versatile module as a way to expand outfit space, allowing their ships to install cargo expansions or extra bunk rooms to suit the task at hand.`

Additionally, as an external protrusion on the ship, it will hamper the ship's maneuverability.`
