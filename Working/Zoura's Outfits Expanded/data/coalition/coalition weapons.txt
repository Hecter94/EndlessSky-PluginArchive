	description "These oddly shaped starlets are the small rockets used in Celebration Modules. Despite their limited protection, the materials used are extremely stable, requiring a specialized electric shock to set them off. Upon detonation, however, they explode in a bright flash and disperse colourful propellant in all direction, producing a gorgeous display of many different colours."

	description "Though Coalition civilians are not normally allowed to purchase explosives of any kind, Celebration Modules exist in a legal limbo, as they are considered a form of artistic expression and thus are allowed to be sold in regulated venues."
	description "	As fireworks, Celebration Modules produce bright flashes and vibrant swathes of colour; though the Heliarchy has taken every precaution to reduce their potential danger, the fact remains that they still do spread fire in all directions, and the bright flash can cause issues with weapon targeting."
	description "	To reduce potential complications with starlets colliding with ships, the rockets contain a small proximity sensor that forces them to explode a distance away from potential victims."

	description `Celebration Modules have long since become associated with the Coalition's great sporting events; trained Heliarch fightercraft engage in "spectral dogfights," where the bright swathes of colour put on a great spectacle for the crowds during the downtime between athletic competitions.`

	description `Celebration Modules have a very long and rich past in the Heliarch legal system - so much so that, in many of the languages of the Coalition, these devices have taken on an alternative name invariably meaning "contraband." To this day, it still remains debated if civilians should be permitted to purchase them, but for now it seems the citizens of the Coalition are permitted to enjoy them (responsibly, of course).`
