	description "This odd Pug device seems to work by lifting a portion of a ship's shields directly from its hull and projecting it outwards towards nearby allied ships. Pug ships have powerful shields that recharge extremely quickly to safely operate this weapon, but there's nothing stopping a human ship from installing it."

	description "This is a sizeable piece of Pug hull, harvested from a destroyed or captured Pug ship. Divorced from the main body of its host ship, it isn't quite as powerful, but it still boasts a noticeably tangible energy field and is warm to the touch. It is, however, noticeably soft, and seems remarkably frail by itself."
