	description "This is a tiny, improvised weapon, hacked together from dozens of laser rifles (presumably stolen from boarded ships). The range is completely unimpressive, and the shots do almost no damage to conventional hull armor; however, the massive barrage of projectiles can cause notably high damage to shields, meaning that - when paired with a good anti-hull weapon like a beam laser - even small ships can make effective use of these niche weapons."

	description "This is a larger version of the Burst Scatter battery, designed to make better use of available gun ports. It's not quite as effective as a pair of smaller burst scatters, but considering the size, it's unlikely a ship will suffer from the reduction in space efficiency."

	description "This is the heaviest permutation of the Burst Scatter weapon used in human space; though it doesn't even match a Heavy Laser in size, the weapon's shield damage is extremely high, meaning any small ship equipped with one will see a great boost to its shield killing potential."

	description `This is two of the smallest Burst Scatter weapons placed on one turret. Though that might not sound very effective, it is a powerful tool for small ships, giving ships with lots of small hardpoints flexibility in combat.`
