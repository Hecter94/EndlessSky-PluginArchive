	description "This is a tiny, improvised weapon, hacked together from dozens of laser rifles (presumably stolen from boarded ships). The range is completely unimpressive, and the shots do almost no damage to conventional hull armor; however, the massive barrage of projectiles can cause notably high damage to shields, meaning that - when paired with a good anti-hull weapon like a beam laser - even small ships can make effective use of these niche weapons."

	description "This is a larger version of the Burst Scatter battery, designed to make better use of available gun ports. It's not quite as effective as a pair of smaller burst scatters, but considering the size, it's unlikely a ship will suffer from the reduction in space efficiency."

	description "This is the heaviest permutation of the Burst Scatter weapon found in human space; though it doesn't even match a Heavy Laser in size, the weapon's shield damage is extremely high, meaning any small ship equipped with one will see a great boost to its shield killing potential."

	description "This is a low-powered pneumatic launcher that sends six-ton reactor rods out into space. The resulting projectile moves slowly and has no sort of homing or proximity detonation, but if it hits its target, the subsequent explosion can cripple an entire fleet of small warships."
	description "	Using uranium reactor rods in this way, however, is a criminal offense, so a hefty fine awaits any captain intending on making heavy use of these improvised weapons."

	description `This unlicensed modification of the Energy Blaster doesn't increase the strength of the blaster's energy bolts, but instead shoots a rapid barrage of them at the cost of a long cooldown period. It is a weapon favored by pirates in interceptors to rapidly take down larger ships and retreat while it cools down.`
	description `	Because its housing wasn't made for dense burst fire created by overloading the energy bolt generators, the Burster tends to almost melt in a protracted firefight.`
