# ANTI-MISSILES
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles.

	description "The inability to purchase Anti-Missile Turrets without heavy import costs means the Southern Defense Pact needed an in-house Anti-Missile system to protect their merchant convoys from pirate attacks. Drawing on the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

	description "A heavy counterpart to the Marksman, this anti-missile pushes its range and precision to the limit, allowing a ship to provide a wide area of missile denial across its allied convoy."

	description "The plasma howitzer is an experimental augmentation of the plasma cannon that uses strong magnets to bind together an oversized plasma projectile, before stuffing the projectile with a bit of hyperspace fuel and launching it. These projectiles are highly unstable, to the point where even a bare graze is enough to release the plasma explosion."
	description "	To keep the magnets cooled enough to function, the weapon must directly tap from the ship's normal cooling systems."

	description "This turret places two Plasma Repeaters on one big mount, with a creative twist: The firing clocks have been tweaked so each individual gun fires slightly faster, allowing the turret to overall more effectively saturate an area. This technology is restricted to Free Worlds Militia ships only."
