# ANTI-MISSILES
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles.

	description "The inability to import Anti-Missile Turrets from Lovelace Labs without heavy import duties has forced the Southern Defense Pact to develop a local anti-missile system, so that they can more easily protect southern merchant convoys from the ever-increasing pirate raids. Drawing from the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed Corporation's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

	description "A heavy counterpart to the Marksman, Tarazed created the Sniper by pushing the capabilities of their anti-missile system to their limits. This anti-missile turret offers a wide area of missile denial owing to its long range and increased precision."

	description "The Plasma Howitzer is an experimental augmentation of the Plasma Cannon that uses strong magnets to bind together an oversized plasma projectile, before stuffing the projectile with a bit of hyperspace fuel and launching it. These projectiles are highly unstable, to the point where even a bare graze is enough to release the plasma explosion."
	description "	To keep the magnets cooled enough to function, the weapon must directly tap from the ship's normal cooling systems."

	description "This turret places two Plasma Repeaters on one big mount, with a creative twist: The firing clocks have been tweaked so each individual gun fires slightly faster, allowing the turret to overall more effectively saturate an area. Because of its effectiveness, the Free Worlds have restricted the sale of this weapon to its Militia only."
