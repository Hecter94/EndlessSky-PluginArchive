	description `"Fightershot" was developed by one of thousands of independent start-ups looking to create cheap and effective starship armaments by crowdfunding their research. While the turret being underfunded lead to it being less than its original creatores hoped it would be, the resultant weapon has some admirable traits: It's cheap to produce, runs on inexpensive materials, and is capable of being fielded by all but the smallest ships.`
	description `	As the name implies, the weapon fires a large spread of pellets; however, these pellets are injected with a small amount of hyperspace fuel between loadings, giving them an explosive bite. These traits, along with its ammunition being simple scrap metal moulded into hollow shells, make it extremely popular in the dirt belt where small pirate vessels are common.`
