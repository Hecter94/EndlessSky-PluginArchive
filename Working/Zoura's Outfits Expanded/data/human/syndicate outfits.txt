# SENTINEL REACTOR
# Just a larger reactor for Syndicate ships. They need more energy now that they use Electrostatic Engines; plus, it adds flavor and variety.

	description "Named for its intended use in the Vanguards and Protectors of the Syndicated Security fleet, the Sentinel Reactor is an enlarged fission reactor developed for heavy warships. It runs quite hot, but nonetheless serves its purpose quite well."

# ELECTROSTATIC ENGINES
# Retains the relatively low heat output of ions, but sucks down much more energy to deliver some good kick. They also require idle energy to maintain, making them exceptionally thirsty for power.
