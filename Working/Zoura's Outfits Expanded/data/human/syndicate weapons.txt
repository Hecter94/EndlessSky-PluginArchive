	description "This turreted pair of Proton Guns uses some crafty engineering to allow both guns to draw from a singular enlarged projectile generator. This allows the turret mount itself to be larger, permitting the whole assembly to turn faster than other turrets of its size."
	description "	The shared projectile generator also has some quirks; namely, the generator is prone to power overdraw - a bug since rebranded by the Syndicate's advertising department as an intended feature, as the overdraw tends to yield surplus proton projectile mass, increasing damage on target."

	description "In response to clusters of alien fighters, the Syndicate has developed a compact variant of the Proton Gun that uses proprietary projectile generators to splinter the shots mid-flight, causing area damage. When mounted on fightercraft in significant numbers, the resultant maelstrom of anti-crowd fire is both awe-inspiring and fear-inducing."

	description "When designing the Proton Flak, the Syndicate engineers responsible realized that such a small weapon would be an excellent fit for a turret for the Protector. This turret compiles 3 Proton Flaks on one mount, with extra turret mass spent on giving the turret a powerful motor to ensure it can quickly snap to approaching fighters."
