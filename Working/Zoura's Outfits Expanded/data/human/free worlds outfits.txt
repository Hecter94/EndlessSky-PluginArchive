	description `For some of their most fuel hungry outfits, the Free Worlds needed a fuel pod that would be able to store more fuel on smaller ships. The Compressed Fuel Pod does just that, but it comes at the expense of a small amount of energy to run the internal pump, and is more prone to fuel leakage and other failures.`

# These are civilian-style shield generators, but sized up to the extreme. They're almost exclusively found on Free Worlds carriers.

	description "Though the Free Worlds doesn't have access to advanced or exotic shield tech of the likes of the Navy or the Syndicate, their carriers do have a lot of space reserved for shield generation. This shield generator derives its power not from technological enhancement, but from its sheer size."
