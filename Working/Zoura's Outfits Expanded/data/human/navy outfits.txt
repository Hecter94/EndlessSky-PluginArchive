# SHIELD GENERATORS
# More powerful than civilian shields, but not quite as wasteful as Syndicate Regenerators.

	description "Navy ships have to deal with combat more frequent and dangerous than most civilian ships will ever see. As such, the Navy utilizes these more advanced shield generators to allow even their fighters to recover quickly."
	description "	Navy shield generators work by cycling far more power through the generator, providing an increase to space efficiency at the cost of consuming extra energy and producing heat while generating shields."

	description "The Navy lacks any sort of dedicated interceptor, so their shield technology skips a size of generator. These shields are capable of supporting most of the Navy's light to medium warships, providing an edge over any equivalent civilian shield generator."

	description "This is the largest and most powerful shield generator produced for the Navy, found exclusively on Navy Auxiliaries. It is capable of outperforming virtually any other shield generator in human space, while remaining relatively affordable in terms of energy and healing requirements."

# COOLING
# A mix of passive and active cooling. Is always partially active, but ramps up to 2/2.5x its base value in accordance with standard active cooling logic.

	"cooling energy" 1.5
	description "The Navy's shields, weapons, and reactors produce considerable amounts of heat. This heat transfer unit works by moving internal heat to the exterior of the ship for radiation, which is always active at some level, but it can also ramp up to twice the power when the ship needs to vent a truly enormous amount of heat."

	description "This larger variant of the Navy's heat transfer tech is not only more effective, but has a higher overclock ceiling, working up to two and a half times the normal limit. It does, however, consume more energy as it ramps up."

# ADVANCED REACTOR
# Developed after the Alpha/Sestor invasion of human space, along with a new turret to go along with it.

	description "The Valkyrie Reactor is an example of the Navy's engineering division pushed to its absolute limit. Designed for large warships, the Valkyrie Reactor supports an anomalously high output potential, allowing particularly hungry weapon systems to be installed more efficiently. These innovations come at the cost of an increased space requirement, and a slightly worse output-per-space ratio than the Armageddon Core. It is most frequently paired with heavy energy weapons such as Electron Beams or the newly-developed Particle Tempest Turrets."
