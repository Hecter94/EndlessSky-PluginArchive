	description `The Particle "Tempest" Turret was designed as a response to an incursion of highly-advanced, dangerous alien vessels. Combining three Particle Cannons on one mount, this extremely heavy turret is designed to push the Particle Cannon to its limit. The resulting turret fires an intensely powerful (though marginally less accurate) burst of intense Particle Cannon fire, followed by a recuperation period. The increased ferocity of the particle accelerators' output increases the recoil and range, while also requiring a greater energy supply.`
