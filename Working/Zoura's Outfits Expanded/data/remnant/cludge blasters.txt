	description `The Cludge Blaster seems like an odd weapon for the Remnant; it has no special qualities, and isn't even particularly effective or deadly. Its true purpose is as a teaching tool; Cludge Blasters are purposefully cheap and somewhat weak so engineering students (or even simple hobby tinkerers) can use other salvaged parts to modify them to improve their performance.`
	description `	Because Cludge Blasters are intended to be upgraded, there are several variants that have since become common in remnant society, and many hobbyists produce these in their free time as a source of income and recreation.`

	description `	This modified Cludge Blaster has had an EMP effect baked into its projectiles, causing it to drain the target (and any very close by ships) of its energy. However, retooling the projectiles in this way did significantly impact its anti-shield performance.`

	description `	This turret features a pair of optimized Cludge Blasters hooked up to a simple automated target acquisition system on a fast-swivelling turret mount. Its small size means even fighters can theoretically make use of it, though it still serves best on larger craft.`

	description `	This Cludge Blaster has had its internal systems completely reworked to fire missile-destroying beams instead of the standard anti-ship projectiles. Though it doesn't have the same punch as a proper Point Defense Turret, it has similar range, and is capable of being comfortably fitted on all but the tiniest of ships.`
