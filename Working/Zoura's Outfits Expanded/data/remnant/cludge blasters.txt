	description `The Cludge Blaster seems like an odd weapon for the Remnant; it has no special qualities, and isn't even particularly effective or deadly. Its true purpose is as a teaching tool; Cludge Blasters are purposefully cheap and somewhat weak so engineering students (or even simple hobby tinkerers) can use other salvaged parts to modify them to improve their performance.`
	description `	Because Cludge Blasters are intended to be upgraded, there are several variants that have since become common in Remnant society, and many hobbyists produce these in their free time as a source of income and recreation.`

	description `	This Cludge Blaster has had its internal systems completely reworked to fire missile-destroying beams instead of the standard anti-ship projectiles. Though it doesn't have the same punch as a proper Point Defense Turret, it has similar range, and is capable of being comfortably fitted on all but the tiniest of ships.`
