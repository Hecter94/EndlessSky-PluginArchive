# Shield Engines
# These provide mediocre thrust, but provide shields while moving.

	description "Though the Remnant have always favored speed and agility over heavy staying power, there are some Remnant engineers who attempt to reconcile the gap. Magnetic Engines work in part by producing a powerful magnetic field, which allows them to stabilize a ship's shield matrix while operating."

	description "Iron-sized Magnetic Engines are designed for medium warships or large freighters; they consume quite a bit of power when running, but provide a powerful shield restoration effect."

	description "The Remnant generally don't use the largest-sized magnetic engines due to their preference for smaller, sleeker ships. For a ship with the space and energy to use them, however, these engines can bolster recovery speed significantly."

	"steering flare sound" "plasma medium"
	description "Magnetic steering systems are generally less resource-intensive than standard Remnant ion engines, but their lesser thrust-per-ton means that they often don't move ships as fast as some captains would like."

	description "Almost as large as a set of Smelter-class thrusters, this steering system guzzles a significant amount of energy while moving. However, the durability boost they provide when tangling with other ships is not to be ignored."
