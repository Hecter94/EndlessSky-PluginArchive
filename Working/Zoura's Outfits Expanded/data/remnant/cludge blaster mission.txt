			`As you browse the available jobs, you notice a few of the Remnant hauling a sled around with what appears to be a variety of modified weapons. Do you want to investigate?`
			choice
				`	(Yes.)`
				`	(No.)`
					decline

			`	You approach the Remnant, and a couple of them look back at you. "Are you interested in these Cludge Blasters?" the leading Remnant in front of the sled chants.`
			choice
				`	"You bet!"`
					goto sale
				`	"Those don't look anything like the Cludge Blasters for sale in the outfitter."`
			
			`	He smiles at your response. "That is because they have been modified by my students," he explains. "Every year, an engineering student's final project is to modify a Cludge Blaster using parts sourced from salvage and occasional military excess; we then sell them to fund next year's projects. Would you be interested?"`

			`	"I'm sure you'll find the modifications fulfil roles not easily found in smaller weapons," the leading Remnant replies. "For you, we will give four for a million credits. Is that acceptable?"`
			choice
				`	"Sounds like a fair deal."`
				`	"If it'll support the future of the Remnant, I might as well."`
				`	"That's a bit outside my price range right now."`
