	description `This is the first generation of the Gegno Vi's "breach sealant" outfits, a relatively new technology that allows a damaged Vi ship to seal any larger wounds in its hull over time. This system is very low-tech, relying on small welding arms placed throughout the ship, but the ability to recover mid-flight is a game-changer in Gegno space. Sadly, most Vi captains don't seem convinced that the tradeoff in firepower is worth the capability to repair mid-flight.`
