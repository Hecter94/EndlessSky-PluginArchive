	description `With the success of their new shield technology, the Gegno Scin needed a quick and easy way to refit many of their ships to use this new technology while the Vi had yet to develop an effective counter. This outfit is, quite literally, just a Halite's shield matrix adapted for installation over a larger ship.`
	description `	It does add quite a bit of mass, and a small amount of drag to the ship it's installed on, but allows any ship of any size to increase its overall shield durability (if only slightly).`
