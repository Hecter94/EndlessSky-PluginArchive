	description "These are pre-charged cells manufactured on-world by the Gegno Scin, for use on warships. One Praeparit Cell can power a large burst of projectiles, though how much effective damage lands on target is up to more luck than most Scin would like."

	description "The Gegno Scin have tried a number of different ways to accelerate the deployment of their plasma-based weaponry. Praeparit Punts utilize pre-charged capacitors to supplant a ship's on-board generation. While this requires an initial spark of on-board electricity to function, the overall operation results in a small amount of energy being returned to the ship."
	description "	The excess in energy tends to overwhelm the Scin's lower-power plasma coils, so the resultant blast of plasma pellets suffers from highly variable range and velocity."
