	description "This large lathe is usually seen on planetside industrial districts, but some of the Gegno have begun using it as a mining tool because it has a longer range than mining drills. The Persistence Lathe is almost completely ineffective against shields, but it does considerable damage to any sort of rock or metal it manages to land on."
	description "	Although crude, the lathe exhibits some odd abilities; the tightly focused beam is capable of partially ignoring shields, but the weapon requires a significant cooldown period between shots."
	description "	The Gegno Civilian populace don't normally have any ships that can use these lathes; instead, careful modifications of the Gypsum are needed to employ them effectively."
