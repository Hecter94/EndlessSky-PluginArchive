	description `This is a Gypsum that has been modified to use Persistence Lathes instead of an Excavator Drill for mining tasks. It features a second gun port and increase weapon space to account for the size of a pair of lathes, but the necessary modifications to increase its outfit space dug into its cargo capacity, and the ship no longer has the ability to use a drill.`
