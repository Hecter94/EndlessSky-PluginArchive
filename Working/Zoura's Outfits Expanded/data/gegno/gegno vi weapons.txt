	description "The Irate Cannon is generally too small to modify extensively, but the simplest trick is to just increase the powder load of its projectiles, increasing velocity, range, and even damage slightly. Overloading the cannon in this way requires an on-ship crew to refurbish the barrel between engagements."

	description "This turret sports a pair of Irate Cannons and the necessary crew to refurbish the barrels between engagements. The increased velocity and damage from the extra powder shines on a turret like this. The size difference between this turret and the larger, more effective Choleric Cannon turret renders the use case of Magnum Irate Turret questionable, but it is an effective replacement should a ship be saving the space for something larger."

	description "Magnetized Rounds are on the higher-tech side for Vi weaponry, but the effects of such magnetization manifest as an attraction to the rounds' targets. Extra care is needed to safely load the specialized rounds, but the bonus to hit probability, range, and shield damage is generally worth the tradeoff."

	description "A modification to the Ballistic Cannon that trade singular, large shells for many smaller ones, utilizing beehive-style munitions. The beehive rounds boast greater velocity and marginally increased damage per shot, but the inevitable spread means that the full payload has trouble hitting at great ranges."

	description "Mounted on a turret, a spray of powerful anti-ship shot is a fearsome prospect. This turret gives the devastating waves of shrapnel the ability to track their targets, allowing for a ship to more effectively fire at large or clumped targets for maximum effect."
