	description "Except for the Vi and Scin, the Gegno do not have many options to improve their ships' surviveability without a more formal refit. As such, one of the few modifications they do make is to simply backfill armor from an open engine port into the main body of the ship, increasing its resilience to hull damage."
	description "	Though this solution works fine enough, it does somewhat hamper the effectiveness of hull repair, and adds quite a bit of mass to the ship."
