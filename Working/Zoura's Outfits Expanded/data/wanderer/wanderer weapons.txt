	description "For millennia the Wanderers have based their entire military strategy around the use of the Sunbeam, which has given rise to support weapons such as the Eclipse Rangefinder. This outfit is designed to hold a target at the perfect range from where they can be hit by Sunbeam fire, while also keeping them far enough to ensure they cannot strike back with shorter-ranged weapons."

	description "When word of the Hai's Flea drone spread to the Wanderers, there was a concern that the Flea's primary armament may not be able to effectively tackle the thicker shields of the Unfettered's new ships. The Effusebeam is derived from the Sunbeam; much smaller, and running at lower power, with a greater emphasis on focusing optics. The result is a relatively easy-to-field beam that can take full advantage of the Flea's tiny gun ports."
	description "Taking inspiration from the Skipper Railgun's recoil system, the Effusebeam also allows a small ship to move away from its target without turning away, though it does this less effectively (but more controllably) than the Hai's own offering."

	description "The Rolling Thunder was, once upon a time, a precursor to the Thunderhead. The concept was simple: Fire a continuous barrage of missiles in such a volume that an anti-missile system would be unable to fight them off."
	description "While the Thunderhead is widely used in space nowadays, a modern-day equivalent of the Rolling Thunder is typically fashioned by splitting Thunderhead missiles into their constituent submunitions and calibrating both the missiles and the launchers to accommodate. Additional armor is often applied in key pieces of the missile, providing a modest amount of extra resilience against anti-missile fire with minimal effect on the missile's performance."

	description "While not especially useful on most Wanderer Ships due to their limited size, the Rolling Thunder has seen a significant resurgence in popularity due to the Flycatcher drone. A pair of Rolling Thunder Pods, even on a relatively cheap and space-inefficient turret platform, makes for a substantially effective long-ranged weapon for planetary defense drones."

	description "To solve the problem of the Rolling Thunder Launcher being too small, the answer was obvious: Simply add more to the preexisting turret design. Five Rolling Thunder launchers work in a tightened burst pattern, perhaps ironically emulating their successor, the Thunderhead. Despite your asking, no answer has been given to the question of why the Wanderers don't just make a Thunderhead Turret."
