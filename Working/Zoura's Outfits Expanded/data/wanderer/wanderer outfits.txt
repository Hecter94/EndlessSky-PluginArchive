	description `The Wanderers' shield generators consume enormous amounts of energy, and while this is suitable for civilian ships, military ships may be forced to eschew shield regeneration for more powerful weapons, decreasing their survivability. In this situation, a shield regulator can be very useful; in exchange for consuming a small amount of energy idly, the regulator sharply reduces the energy draw that occurs while a ship is recharging its shields.`
