	description `This is a shelf-stable gas that the Hai developed as a crowd control tool. Able to be dispersed in great quantities from their ships, it is a rather effective method of controlling the pace of battle, allowing Hai ships to escape through a cloud of thick, electrified smoke when needed.`

	description "This essentially one of the standard tanks from a Charge Gas Sprayer separated into its own dedicated unit, with some slight adaptations to allow it to dispense or receive Charge Gas to and from standard gas canisters."
	description "	Because the gas requires special conduits to connect properly to the main sprayer, some of said conduits must be installed in the ship's weapon section."

	description `Charge Gas was developed by the Hai during their war with the Korath as an easily implementable way to force Korath ships into unfavourable combat conditions. The basic principle is simple: An easily producible, stable gas that holds an ionizing charge for long periods of time, deployed in broad sweeps to inhibit enemy movement. When dispensed from a fast moving platform like a Lightning Bug, it becomes a very effective crowd controlling tool.`
	description `	The Charge Gas storage, containment, and launching network has some curious traits to it as well. In particular, stored charge gas can act as a reserve ion sink; a small amount of gas can't noticeably dissipate much, but a full tank will quickly absorb any ionization affecting a ship. Additionally, if not allowed to spread out and set properly, the Charge Gas won't be as effective.`
