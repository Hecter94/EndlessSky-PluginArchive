	description "To tweak their ships' performance to perfection, the Hai have designed these tiny regenerators. They don't generate much shield by themselves, but they allow smaller ships to adjust their shield matrix's durability as needed."

	description "The Vibrissae Shield Buffer is a compact outfit suitable for any Hai captain who wants to upgrade their ship's shield matrix, boosting its durability significantly. This upgrade, however, comes at the cost of requiring more energy to recharge the ship's shield, and generating extra heat while the shields are recharging."
	description "	Because it must be installed near the exterior of the ship's hull to provide its shield-bolstering abilities, it must replace some of a ship's standard hull armor."

	description "While an old technology for the Hai, shield buffers saw a resurgence during the Korath raids when Hai ships had to be rapidly adapted to be able to take on the more technologically advanced ships of the Anatruskor, and have been continuously used in the conflict with the Unfettered. One Pelage shield buffer can improve the base shield matrix of a Shield Beetle by nearly fifteen percent."

# LABOR ENGINES
# Bulky engines with reduced power over atomics, good for freighters thanks to their increased cargo capacity.

	description "Many Hai live in regions where commercial efficiency is more of a worry than needing to rush either to somewhere or away from something. Labor Engines aren't as powerful as atomic engines, but are more efficient, and grant small bonuses to a ship's cargo space."

	description "Labor Engines carry a significant amount of dead weight to shield cargo from potential damage caused by being near the engine bay, but many Hai consider the extra capacity worth the loss in speed."

	description "The extra bulk added by these engines is hard for most ships to ignore, but the resultant cargo space is comparable to some small freighters in its own right."

	description "A labor engine of this size is more or less just bolting a light freighter to your engine block. The Hai are in disagreement over if this is a positive or negative description."

	description "The smallest labor steering doesn't really give an appreciable amount of cargo space, but when combined with its sister thruster, can still extend the courier ability of most small ships."

	description "Labor Engines generally feel underpowered relative to their contemporaries, not due just to their reduced power, but also the excess weight they add to a ship. The inertia they add, however, means ships generally don't suffer significant top speed losses."

	description "For a steering system, this engine is overkill for most ships. However, the extra cargo space it packs allows flexibility among ships. The Hai will occasionally equip Shield Beetles with these engines, allowing them to haul cargo in addition to defending more dedicated freighters."
