	description "The Unfettered needed a higher-energy-density reactor for their fighters, but ran into the issue of high energy reactors being too hot to run on their ships. This reactor naturally runs very hot by Hai standards, but can modulate its performance, allowing it to self-cool to suit a host ship's needs."

	description "The Unfettered's reliance on their Solifuges and the Violin Spider fighters they carry means that they have a vested interest in micromanaging ships to be well-optimized. This cooling system is half the size of the Hai's smallest cooling system, but provides just over half the cooling."
