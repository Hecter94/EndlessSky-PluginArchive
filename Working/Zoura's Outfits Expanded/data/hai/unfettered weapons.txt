	description `The Unfettered have had no qualms with tweaking Hai technology for their own uses, and this weapon is a good example of that. Essentially an ionic grenade launcher, the simple fabricated canisters fired are under high pressure and likely to explode long before they reach their target, but the unfettered's actions to reduce the size as much as possible by cutting out some of the tanks have resulted in a potent fighter weapon.`
