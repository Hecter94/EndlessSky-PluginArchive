	description `The Unfettered have made a point of tweaking and improving Hai technology for their own uses, and this weapon is a good example of this strategy. Essentially an ionic grenade launcher, this weapon fires Charge Gas canisters that are under high pressure, making them likely to explode long before they reach their target. By re-engineering the Charge Gas Sprayer into a smaller weapon and cutting out an integrated storage tank, the Unfettered have created a potent fighter weapon out of a system typically reserved for larger ships.`
	description `	Though not a significant factor in the weapon's effectiveness, the frangible canisters fired deal minor damage to the target, making this weapon significantly more effective against hull.`

	description `The compact and greater-ranged nature of the Charge Gas Grenadier means it is a suitable candidate for being mounted aboard turrets. The Charge Barrage turret fires tight bursts of eight Charge Gas grenades in rapid succession, bombarding the target with ionic gas and shrapnel, before a somewhat lengthy reload period.`
	description `	To make better use of the larger size of turret-wielding ships, the turret includes an auxiliary gas tank.`
