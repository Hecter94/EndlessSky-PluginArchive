	`Sorry, can't get you out of here; I just run the bar. What I can do, though, is teach you how to play, since this is a pretty hack-job minigame.`
	`	You'll spawn on Dying Flame, which is your hub of sorts. From there, you can take on new levels, manage your weapons and ammunition, and so on. It's also where you'll leave from and return before and after each wave, so pay attention.`
	`	Your Hull bar represents your health; straightforward enough, but your Shield bar represents your stamina. This is largely used for sprinting; zombies will move faster than your default speed, so sprinting is critical in being able to maintain distance. Each of these statistics will regenerate over time after a delay; pretty simple, if I do say so myself.`
	`	During gameplay, zombies will drop flotsam boxes containing coins; coins can be sold here in the outfitter for credits, which in turn can be exchanged for guns and ammunition; guns in the gun store job, ammunition in the outfitter itself. Completing a wave, however, earns you a far more valuable token. Tokens can be used to buy a menagerie of different perks through the token shop (in Dying Light's job board), ranging some simple pocket upgrades to deepen your ammunition capacity to special perks you can only buy once.`
	`	Each wave will spawn a fixed amount of mission target zombies for you to have at; however, there are naturally spawning low-level zombies around for you to farm some cash from if you run low on funds.`
	`	I think that's it for now. Any other questions? No?`
