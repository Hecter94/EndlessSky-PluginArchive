	description `At first, Zavatta Station looks like any old, almost abandoned station that lay in almost ruins. The docking port and fueling station are still functional, but that's all that can be said... That is, until you hear squeaking. Map says there's an outfitter and spaceport, but...`
	spaceport `The spaceport is bustling. Absolutely bustling. With the sound of bike horns and squeaking. There's clowns everywhere. Some of them seem to be working on cars. Except one of the cars just took off. You're not sure how. Best not to question anything here.`
