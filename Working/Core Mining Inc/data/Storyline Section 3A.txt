			`	"Didn't you have any idea he was planning this?" asked a technician.`
			`	"I had some idea that he wasn't very happy with the aboveboard way I was running the company, but I never thought he would go this far." Michael replied.

That, and the fact that he also hired other people friendly to him also helped his cause."`

"How many of you want some time to think about it?" No one raised their hand. "Who all wants to stay?" Every person in the lounge raised their hand. "Thank you all for the vote of confidence." Michael says.`
