	planet "Stormhold"
		description `A cold planet, with dense, foggy atmosphere. Stormhold used to be under pirate control but was liberated by Core Mining, Inc. in their quest to eliminate the pirate presence in the area. It has now been made quite decent looking, with many of the reminders of the pirate presence gone.`
		spaceport `The spaceport is a large town, consisting mainly of workers for the newly begun mining operation on the planet. Of course, several off worlders have settled in the town and started shops and stores, several of which serve fairly good food.`
