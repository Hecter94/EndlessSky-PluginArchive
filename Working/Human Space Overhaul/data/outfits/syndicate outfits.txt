	description "Though the Syndicate does offer their warships and advanced outfits to anyone who joins their security forces, they also offer a non-binding form of license that allows any captain willing to pay both an appreciable upfront cost and continuous fee to get access to their non-civilian outfits. This is popular with some captains; but incredibly despised by others."

# BATTERIES
# Better than standard human batteries, but quite dense.

# SENTINEL REACTOR
# Just a larger reactor for Syndicate ships. They need more energy now that they use Electrostatic Engines; plus, it adds flavor and variety.

	description "The shared projectile generator also has some quirks; namely, the generator is prone to power overdraw -- a bug since rebranded by the Syndicate's engineers as an intended feature, as the overdraw tends to yield surplus proton projectile mass, increasing damage on target."

# ELECTROSTATIC ENGINES
# Retains the relatively low heat output of ions, but sucks down much more energy to deliver some good kick. They also require idle energy to maintain, making them exceptionally thirty for power.
