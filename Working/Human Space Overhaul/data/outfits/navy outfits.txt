	description "Navy ships have to deal with combat more frequent and dangerous than most civilian ships will ever see. As such, the Navy utilizes these more advanced shield generators to allow even their fighters recover quickly."
	description "Navy shield generators work by cycling far more power through the generator, providing an increase to space efficiency at the cost of consuming extra energy and producing heat while generating shields."

	description "The Navy lacks any sort of dedicated interceptor, so their shield technology directly jumps up to a more middling size. These shields are capable of supporting most of the Navy's light to medium warships, providing an edge over any equivalent civilian shield generator."

	description "This generator is designed to service the Navy's capital ships, consuming considerable energy and potentially requiring extra cooling. However, it vastly outperforms any civilian shield generator for its size, making it valuable for military craft like the navy's Cruisers and Carriers."

# COOLING
# A mix of passive and active cooling. Is always partially active, but ramps up to 2/2.5x its base value in accordance with standard active cooling logic.

	description "The Navy's shields, weapons, and reactors produce considerable amounts of heat. This heat pump works by moving internal heat to the exterior of the ship for radiation, always working at some level, but ramping up to twice the power when the ship needs to vent a truly enormous amount of heat."

	description "This is a larger variant of the Navy's heat pumping tech is not only overall more effective, but has a higher overclock ceiling, working up to two and a half times the normal limit. It does, however, consume more energy as it ramps up."
