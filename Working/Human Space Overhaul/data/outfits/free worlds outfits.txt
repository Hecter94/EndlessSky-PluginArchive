# ANTI-MISSILES
# The south doesn't have any planets that sell anti-missiles separate from ships. While it's not impossible to import things, it makes more sense to me to have them make their own anti-missiles.

	description "The inability to purchase Anti-Missile Turrets without heavy import costs means the Southern Defense Pact needed an in-house Anti-Missile system to protect their merchant convoys from pirate attacks. Drawing on the Quarg's long-ranged anti-missile systems, Tarazed's new offering focuses not on delivering as much anti-missile as possible, but firing more accurately over longer ranges."

# SHIELDS
# These are civilian-style shield generators, but sized up to the extreme. They're almost exclusively found on free world carriers.

	description "This is a turreted version of the Plasma Repeater. Due to issues with getting the firing clocks working synchronously, the turret fires tighter volleys of shots with a brief cooldown between each half-dozen projectiles."
