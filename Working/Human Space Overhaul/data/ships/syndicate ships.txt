	description `Voted the "ugliest ship in the sky" by Stars and Starships Magazine, the Protector is a typical example of brutally efficient Syndicate engineering. It is basically nothing more than eight turrets attached to a set of engines and crew's quarters, designed as a defense platform that can accompany merchant convoys.`

	description `The Vanguard is Syndicated Systems' newest warship intended for the heavy anti-pirate defense market. Vanguards offer an unusual feature set, focusing on powerful fixed guns and featuring Syndicated Systems' latest automation technologies, resulting in an atypically low crew complement for a ship its size. Few capital ships will endure for long under the withering fusillade of gunfire that it can unleash against those in front of it.`
