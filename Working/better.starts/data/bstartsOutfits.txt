	description "Although humanity is now capable of producing antimatter in relatively significant quantities when compared to a thousand years ago, it is still nothing next to the output of the Quarg, who can produce enough antimatter to outfit even civilian ships with an extremely compact Antimatter Core. This device releases extreme amounts of energy in a simple, elegant package, all while producing surprisingly little waste heat."

	description "Quarg thrusters are quite powerful for their size and produce very little heat, but at the cost of consuming immense amounts of energy. The mechanism by which they produce thrust is unknown, but it is rumored that the passing of a Quarg ship wreaks havoc on every gravitational wave antenna in the system."
	description "	They also have strange capabilities which seem to violate the laws of physics as humanity understands them. Ships with these engines accelerate faster under their own power than one would expect, while also taking less impact from external forces."

	description "According to rumor, some Quarg ships have their steering engines installed internally, with no need for external thrusters. Much like a gyroscope, they can seemingly orient a ship from anywhere, but unlike them they never seem to saturate or become locked."
