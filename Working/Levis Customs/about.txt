Ever wanted a Leviathan that would carry you nicely into midgame? No? Well, too bad! At Levi's customs, we prioritize making stellar-quality Leviathans at affordable prices. Well, as affordable as they come, anyhow.

To get started, visit Bluestone (in the Bellatrix System; north part of Syndicate space) to get started! Fair warning, the ships are sold with sparse outfits; you could end up spending more money on outfitting them than actually buying the ships!
