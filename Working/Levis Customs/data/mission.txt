			`You land on the planet, looking around for this so-called "Levi's Customs" you've heard about. You're approached by a large man in a welding apron, who wastes no time introducing himself: "Welcome to Levi's customs, home of the finest augmented ships this side of the galactic core," He greets, "I'm Levi Hangam; the third. My family's been modifying Leviathans since before I was born, and if I may be so bold, I'd say we're among the best at it," He states with a proud chuckle.`
			`"So you make marauder-type vessels?" You ask. Levi chuckles and shakes his head, "We go much further than a typical marauder work crew," He states calmly, "We go through the Leviathan and rebuild it plate by plate, to the exact specifications of our customers," He explains, "Hardpoints, hull integrity, and even special features not found elsewhere in human space; each Leviathan we put out is unique as it gets," He details, pausing for a moment, before adding a sly, "So, can I interest you in a custom worked Leviathan?" He asks, "We start at 20 million credits."`

			`"It's pricey, sure, but you won't find better quality in human space, I assure you. They may start out as humble Leviathans, but once we're done with them they can easily go toe-to-toe with the republic's mightiest ships," Levi states matter-of-factly.`

			`"Alright!" He cheers, grabbing a notepad from his desk, "So, for starters, we offer hardpoints in sets of two: Two guns, two turrets, or two bays for fighters. You get to pick up to three pairs of hardpoints to be added do your new ship; we'll handle the logistics," He states.`

			`You tilt your head, "Can't you do it right away?" You ask.`
			`Levi shakes his head, "Company policy; I don't need you to fly it for long. Just hop into it as if it were a new, shiny flagship, take off, and land back here. I don't even need you to really go anywhere; just departing and landing right away is fine by me."`
