	description "This ship has been modified by the Unfettered Hai, after that they succesfully invaded Wanderer space. Their primary intention was to increase the weapon space to install more Ion Cannons, but since they were unable to do much they focused on the Solifuge development and, after it was completed, they tried to increase the other attributes instead with good results at the cost of manuevrability and heat control."

	description "Compared to the other freighter used by the Remnant the Swan is an old and outdated design: developed at the same time as the agile Starling, but without any integrated cloaking technology. Its main purpose is hauling large quantities of goods between planets, where, if needed, it can land to repair the hull or use its firepower to join the defense fleets."

	description "Most of the ships the Unfettered had back when they splitted from the rest of the Hai weren't usable as missile boats, and for a while they had to rely heavily on pulse weapons instead. Only after some decades of hard work they were able to take the Sea Scorpion into mass production, but it was worth it: its low price and high number of gun ports make it perfect for its role, at the cost of a weak hull and shielding."
