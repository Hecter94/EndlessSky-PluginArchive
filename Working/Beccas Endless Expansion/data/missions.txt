This time, you don't even have to give your name to the receptionist; as soon as she sees you, she says: "Welcome, Captain <last>! Barmy Edward is waiting for you in building 13, second floor, room 9." The whole buliding 13 reveals to be a weapon testing laboratory, with the second floor being focused on rifles testing. Barmy is in front of the room's door, with a smile on his face. He looks quite excited. "<first>! Long time no see. Are you ready to see the most beautiful thing in your life?"`

The room is a rifle range, with some targets on the far side that start moving on some rails as soon as Barmy presses a switch. "For many decades, here at Kraz, we tried to understand enough about the Heavy Lasers to improve them. The Deep, once again, beat us with their fantastic Electron Beam. While we haven't been able to replicate them, our previous studies on the laser technology haven't been a total waste of time, but I guess you will judge that yourself." He opens a safe box and takes out a large rifle.`

"Not to mention," he adds," the fact they are barely legal, and could be banished one day. At least, I wouldn't start launching explosives in a ship where the smallest hole would kill you soon. Anyways, you can try it yourself. Shoot at those moving targets."`
