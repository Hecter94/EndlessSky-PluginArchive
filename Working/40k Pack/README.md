Currently have:
-15 Imperial Navy ships + outfits
-2 Tau ships + outfits

Currently only Imperial ships and outfits can be purchased at forge world Pifitus at system Pyherrus south of Syndicate space. To access Tau ships and outfits AES Omnis is required.

Notes:
Stats are not 100% accurate to lore, most are somewhat reduced so Endless Sky can handle it, for example the number of crews are significantly reduced, most are slaves and servitors you don't really pay anyway. Mass is reduced so ships do not experience "bounce back" glitch when exiting hyperspace. Ships scales are half-calculated half-eyeballed to be a bit more practical in Endless Sky (tiny) scale. However, worry not about the weapon, they still pack the punch they should.(Thanks to their sheer scale compared to Endless Sky.)
