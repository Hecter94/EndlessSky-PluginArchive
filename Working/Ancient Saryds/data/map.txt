planet "Old Bright Echo"
	attributes saryd urban
	landscape land/snow21
	description `Because this world was always planned from the early days of Saryd Culture, it is of little surprise to you that - though less developed than its modern day counterpart - Bright Echo retains most features of its modern day self. Like all Ancient Saryd buildings, however, it does bear a certain "rustic charm".`
	spaceport `The spaceport is ironically far more developed here than modern day Saryd culture, mostly due to the presence of turntables for commercial ships to quickly cycle their loads of incoming goods. It is a simple but robust solution to the problem of how to unload the massive amounts of goods trainships can hold; however, it does beg the question as to how the Saryds ever evolved out of their "train phase".`

	landscape land/myrabella0
	description `Unlike most planets in Ancient Saryd Space, Cool Forest seems to serve almost exactly the same purpose as its modern incarnation, though the building and clothing styles - as well as the demographics present - here are noticeably different.`
	spaceport `With more and more processing taking place directly on Diligent Hand, Cool Forest is less-freqently visited by ships. However, Cool Forest is the premiere source for advanced outfitting equipment in the system; much to the chagrin of some.`

planet "Old Diligent Hand"
	attributes factory saryd inconsistent
	landscape land/badlands12
	description `Though this planet is still a factory world, the methods used are far less refined than that of the modern day's. Work here is done by Saryd hand in large, collective workspaces, where steam-driven conveyors ensure all the components and machines produced are collaborated on with minimal effort on the part of the workers. Though solar power is not present in its modern incarnation, large solar boilers dot the surface, driving steam turbines without quite as much fuel burning during daytime.`
	spaceport `The spaceport on Diligent Hand is vastly more robust than the modern day; instead of simple landing pads, large turntables allow the rapid, efficient cycling of incoming Tranship cars for ones pre-loaded with machinery on-world, making for a surprisingly efficient system that rivals modern day loading methods.`

	attributes farming saryd urban
	landscape land/mountain15-sfiera
	description `This planet seems to have been settled for quite a while, and the Saryds have wasted little time in turning it into a highly productive agricultural world. Though there is little in the way of tourism, the spaceport is very busy, with massive moving crews loading and hauling large carts towards the hangars where trainships configured for hauling duty await their payload of fresh produce.`
	spaceport `The spaceport resembles its modern counterpart quite well, save for the distinct lack of Kimek or Arachi. Though the planet doesn't host any turntables for trainship reconfiguration, it does have a particularly well-stocked outfitter.`

planet "Old Flowing Fields"
	attributes farming hunting saryd inconsistent
	landscape land/dune0
	description `Though this planet is a farming world like its modern day counterpart, the vast biodiversity have attracted a particularly interesting subset of the population: Hunters. Many bands of Saryds looking to take a week's sabbatical find this world irresistible, purchasing large caliber hunting rifles and shotguns to shoot something particularly exciting. The planet's tourism agency reports a surprising lack of casualties, though a few more honest associates admit that missing bodies are not counted in the mortality reports.`
	spaceport `With the thriving hunting scene, the spaceport almost always has a crowd of volunteers lining up to shoot any creatures that dare to encroach on the open-stalled market, selling various goods of both the farming and hunting variety. This is one of the few non-military worlds where high-powered, military styled firearms like machine guns or even explosive launchers can be purchased.`

planet "Old Glittering Ice"
	attributes saryd hunting
	landscape land/snow7
	description `Though no warmer than its modern day counterpart, the more weapons-free culture of the Ancient Saryds means that this world has a sizeable population of hunters looking for a good catch, or simply some serene time out in nature. ...With guns.`
	description `	It's an understandable industry, as even a couple of the creatures here likely yield enough meat to feed a family for weeks.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is moderately busy, with a small open market taking advantage of the harsh cold, keeping food frozen without any input from the Saryds themselves. Teams of Saryd hunters can be seen hauling massive, heavyset creatures to butcheries for carving, and the mood of the spaceport is quite jovial; several Saryds come up to offer you a piece of their newest hunt as you look around.`
	security 0.3
	
planet "Old Mystery"
	attributes moon saryd
	landscape land/canyon05
	description `This moon is not particularly well-developed, but the Saryds still host some trading here due to large quantities of raw resources being mined up from the dust. Working in the mines is dirty, unflattering work - but the Saryds doing it have certainly developed quite a lot of muscle, despite the low gravity.`
	spaceport `The spaceport here is small, with just enough room for the steady trickle of cargo trainships that export large quantities of minerals from here. Most exports go directly to the main planet, Saros.`


	
planet "Old Saros"
	attributes "ancient saryd"
	landscape land/valley12-harro
	description `This appears to be the homeworld of the Saryds, but it lacks much of the modern refinement of the present day. The Saryds here also wear different clothing, and the machines seem far more robust; large steam engines can be seen plowing both along the surface and into space, and the planet bares the distinct scars of a species that has only recently realized the importance of taking care of their planet.`
	spaceport `The spaceport bears little resemblance to a modern spaceport; large rockets are stationed to aid ships into orbit, as repulsor technology doesn't seem to be particularly advanced yet, and the steam engines the Saryds are using - though impressive - lack the grunt needed to push a ship in space without assistance. Your advanced ship with its repulsors draw a large amount of attention.`

planet "Old Secret Sky"
	attributes research saryd
	landscape land/sea13-sfiera
	description `Much of the vegetation here seems to be overlooked in terms of the ways the Saryds of modern times use them, but the planet is still a highly research heavy world; however, in the time of the Ancient Saryds, the tests here are conducted by many scientists looking to improve Saryd technology for the better, be it via improvements to well-established steam technology or experimental forays into steamless alternatives.`
	description `	Security here is extremely tight due to the fact that many of the most forward thinking Saryd scientists "go silent" shortly after researching their greatest works. Whether this means they're found dead or are simply gone missing, most Saryds refuse to clarify for you.`
	spaceport `Because the research here is so closely guarded, Secret Sky hosts a surprisingly large militia presence; comparable to some of the largest Heliarch Military fleets in modern times. This spaceport is equipped mostly for servicing militia vessels, though a few smaller turntables are reserved for transport vessels.`

planet "Old Revelation"
	attributes moon saryd inconsistent
	landscape land/canyon0
	description `Despite the fact that the landing of the first rocket should be very recent according to the fact that the Ancient Saryds are still using steam, Revelation shows signs of great development not present in the modern day: A small shipyard and outfitter, located in a carefully constructed sealed building, sit readily, allowing Saryd captains to quickly swap out their fighters or buy fresh Trainship Engines on the fly.`
	spaceport `The spaceport is not remarkable, save for the fact that it seems beyond the technology of the time. Saryds walk around in special suits with emergency respirators in the event of a breach, but apparently there hasn't been any major damage to the facility since it was first built somewhere over a century ago.`

	description `The Ancients' version of Vibrant Water has been settled drastically differently than its modern counterpart, to the point where it's difficult to tell it's even the same planet. Most of the occupation here takes place in the form of enormous oil rigs the size of large cities, organizing millions of individuals on one highly engineered structure. The industry here is remarkably robust to boot, supporting multiple large trainship yards and a thriving foray into early hydroponic farming.`
	spaceport `The spaceport rigs are built near the oil rigs; carefully considered platforms with great turntables on them, hosting a commercial presence beyond any comparable human world. The Saryd presence here is indeed so great that Vibrant Water has its own private militia, beyond any requests from an interplanetary authority.`
