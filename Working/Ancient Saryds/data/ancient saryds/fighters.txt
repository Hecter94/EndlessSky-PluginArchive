	description `Compared to modern fighters, this Ancient Saryd fightercraft is clunky, and somewhat difficult to maneuver. However, it boasts an incredible degree of versatility, being able to not only carry nearly a dozen crew, but also a small amount of cargo, as well as an array of weapon setups due to its hardpoint arrangement.`
