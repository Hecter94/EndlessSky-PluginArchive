	description "This small thruster operates using the venting of steam through mechanical apparati to generate thrust. Though the engines themselves are fairly small and uncomplex, the necessity of having a large boiler to fire them offsets their lightness."
	description "	Steam engines require a pittance of energy and actually help a ship vent heat by forcing hot steam out of the craft, but require functional boilers to source the steam needed for their operation."

	description "This large steam thruster is the primary mode of locomotion for the Ancient Saryds' great trainships. Its steam usage is nearly greater than an entire Hitchhiker-class fighter, but it is nonetheless a necessity for moving the hefty hulls of the trainships at any decent speed."

	description "This innovative engine design uses a bit more energy and much greater steam pressure to produce a far greater amount of thrust than their earlier generation alternatives."
	description "	Pressure engines consume much more steam and produce far more heat than their lower-powered alternatives, but produce vastly greater thrust despite their smaller size."
