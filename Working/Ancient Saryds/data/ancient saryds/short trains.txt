	description "Though the basic train chassis isn't remarkable, it is notable for being surprisingly large considering the rudimentary methods the Saryds have to get ships into space. Of course, the empty trainship is just that: empty. It has no cars to speak of, and thus relies on its own adequate features to stake its own claim."

	description `This is an Ancient Saryd Trainship outfitted in a "Short Cargo" configuration, which means it has two cars swapped in for carrying large amounts of cargo across space. The scope of the cars is massive; each provides the same amount of cargo space as more than two Syndicate Freighters, while also providing its own defensive turret points and a large amount of armor and shield emission.`

	description `This is an Ancient Saryd Trainship outfitted in a "Short Freight Carrier" configuration, meaning it has one freight car and one carrier car, granting it greater capacity than a carrier train while having more versatility than a cargo train. It is this modularity that makes the trainships so valued in Ancient Saryd culture, begging the question as to why the Saryds ever switched to fixed-feature multipurpose craft.`

	description `This is an Ancient Saryd Trainship outfitted in a "Short Battlefreighter" configuration, meaning it has one car for battle and one car for hauling freight. The mix of on-board weaponry and generous capacity makes this the only choice for a cargo train in the eyes of the Ancient Saryd Militia, and makes it a good choice for anyone looking to ensure a large payload gets where it needs to go.`

	description `This is an Ancient Saryd Trainship outfitted in a "Short Carrier" configuration, meaning it has two cars that each hold 4 fighters in flight. Though fighters are beginning to fall out of favour with the Ancient Saryds, they still support these impressively rigged ships. The carrier cars don't give quite as much of a boost to hull armor, but provide a further increase to shield strength than a cargo or combat car, and the ability to easily swap fighters in instead of arduously trading train cars does have its perks.`

	description `This is an Ancient Saryd Trainship outfitted in a "Short Combat" configuration, meaning it has a pair of cars designed for the rigors of battle. Combat cars do not have the capacity of cargo cars or the flexibility of carrier cars; instead, they provide the most (literal) bang for your buck. A single combat car has the firepower to rival a human warship of similar size, and a pair attached to a trainship are a force to be reckoned with.`
