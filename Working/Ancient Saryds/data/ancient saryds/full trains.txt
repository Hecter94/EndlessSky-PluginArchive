	description `This balanced configuration of the Trainship includes one of each car: Combat, Carrier, and Cargo. The result is a very well-rounded ship used all over Ancient Saryd space, bringing all the benefits of each car type to the forefront without comrpomising on any other attribute... Except speed.`

# Cargo configuration - Because the deep river was overrated anyway.

	description `With three cargo containers, this full-configuration cargo trainship is a beast to control, but provides unparalleled cargo capacity among Ancient Saryds or even their more modern, coalition-integrated counterparts. However, the limited mobility makes the ship an easy target, and not all Saryd planets are built to easily handle a 3 car layout.`

# Carrier configuration - Twice the Skein's capacity, with better HP to boot.

	description `With three combat cars, the trainship becomes a weapon to surpass even the greatest human ships. Over a dozen turrets, powerful armor and shields, and plenty of space for all the bells and whistles needed for a combat vessel. This configuration is favoured by some members of the Ancient Saryd militia, but its weight and cost make it a hard sell for most.`
