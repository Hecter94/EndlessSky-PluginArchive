			`As you close in on Old Secret Sky, Omaba directs you not to the usual spaceport, but to a more secluded location, being heavily patrolled by a screen of fighters and turrets on the ground below. You can't help but feel a bit nervous, as if you're about to be blown to bits by a stronghold's defenses, but then a translated voice comes through the radio: "You are cleared to land, outsiders," It says, as the fighters briefly part just enough to allow your ship through.`
			`	When you land, your ship is approached by a number of heavily armed and armored Saryds, and are subject to a thorough patdown; Omaba is subject to the same. Walking inside the spaceport once you're clear, you come face to face with a Saryd in what appears to be a body plan-adapted labcoat; she's visibly younger than Omaba.`
			`	"So, arrived the outsider finally has," The Saryd says, "Papilana am I, doctor of engines." The translator seems to be having some trouble with her speech, as Omaba gives the device around your neck a perplexed look, but the other Saryd keeps speaking.`
			`	"A request of you I have, one of very vast importance. My greatest triumph is on my eve..." Papilana keeps speaking, but the translator stops for a moment, eventually cutting back on, "...Need a courier, I do," She finishes, leaving you a little lost without the translation.`
			`	"She's on the eve of a great advancement for their steam powered engines, however, many prototypes get smashed before they can be shipped out for production," Omaba fills in, taking a moment to inspect your translator for damage.`

			`"Some time. Days numbering in several, perhaps," She says, "Enough time to call about manufacturing I must have. Careful we must be; in my mind no doubt you will be stopped there is. Fleeing your only respite may be," Papilana warns, "Beyond time, plans and prototypes end up on Diligent Hand for manufacturing they must. Go there directly you will, for of the greatest essence time is," She says sternly, going so far as to grab you by the collar of the shirt to look you eye-to-eye, "Communicate with me you will not. Go directly you will to Diligent Hand.`
			`	Omaba looks at you for a moment. "Hmm... Perhaps we could do a round trip of sorts; to Secret Sky in the present, then back to the past," She says, turning to Papilana, "That should give you a week."`
			`	Papilana nods, "Time enough that should be, for your help I thank you. Five million credits up front, yours will be; come when the engines are put in service more payment will," She says.`
			`	You and Omaba thank her for her generosity, and return to your ship, where the prototype engines are already being loaded.`

"A great service, you have done us," They say, "Understand you are being paid by Doctor Papilana, I do, but my own contribution to your cause, I make," He says, handing you what seems to be a check for something along the lines of 3 million credits.`
			`	"Expect them in outfitters by, when can we?" Omaba asks. The director thinks for a moment, "Long it will be not," He says, "Well-organized lines, I run. First copies in a couple days, we will make."`
			`	Omaba nods and looks at you. "I will find my own way back to Saros. Thank you for your help," She says, giving you a small smile as you prepare to take off.`
			`	You can't help but wonder why you weren't stopped on your way in or out. Perhaps you just got lucky, or perhaps nobody suspected an outsider to be moving technology around.`

You give your translator a few pre-emptive disciplinary taps, since it seems to struggle with Papilana's particular brand of Saryd.`
			`	Speaking of, Papilana smiles as she sees you. "Ah, welcome back here you are, Outsider. At home do make yourself, please," She says, gesturing to a chair that's clearly meant for Saryds and not people. You opt to stand politely, and Papilana accepts this (if begrudgingly, judging by her expression).`

Alas, secrets I cannot divulge; too sensitive, even for the outsider that is our most trusted," She says.`
			`	She thinks for a moment, "The latest generation of standard steam thrusters was of my research; emerged as an experimental offshoot, pressurized engines did. Great success they are seeing; glad I am, and grateful to you I am doubly so. Without you, never be completed my research would."`
			`	You thank her for the opportunity (and the generous payment). She smiles at you, "Anything further, ask would you like to?" She asks.`
				goto questions

			`Papilana thinks for a long moment, "Many factors contribute," She says, "Reliable, steam is, and much do we have to explore before we hit the ceiling. Just with the pressure engine release, did a comeback of reboilers did we see. Endless possibilities, there are not, but plenty for years to come there are," She explains.`
			`	"Plus... On a less lighter note, disappear do many researchers who go beyond steam," She explains, looking around a bit, paranoid, "Why I had you safeguard the engines, that is," She explains. You nod a bit, promising her that you'll aid her however you can, and she thanks you.`
			`	"Anything else, did you want to ask?" She asks.`
				goto questions

			`Papilana chuckles softly, "Ah, a workaholic I am," She admits, "Love my job and what it entails, I do greatly. But, when forced out of the office by worried colleagues I am, Alothikwatching I do greatly enjoy. Away it gets me from the stiff pace of research," She explains. You have no idea what an "Alothik" is, but considering the context, you assume they're allegorical to terrestrial birds.`
			`	Papilana continues, "Occasionally, clear my head I must. Stormy ocean worlds I visit, where the turmoil in waves matches the turmoil of my mind," She explains, "Good for the mind, ambient change is. How I retain my mental youth, it is."`
			`	You nod. "Anything else, would you like to ask?" She asks.`

			`Papilana chuckles, "Rare it is that I am paid directly; a budget, I must follow. Covers work, personal, and other expenses, it does. However, rest assured, pay you well for your services, I may," She promises, giving you a wink that you have a hard time reading the meaning of. If only the funny box around your neck could tell you expressions, too.`
				goto questions
				
			label lovers
			`It's a good thing you asked this question before the tea was served, because judging by the shocked expression on her face, she would've ended up spitting it at you. After a brief pause, she laughs somewhat awkwardly, "Oh, goodness me, Outsider. No lovers do I have; only family and close colleagues. Cherish my work relationships, I do very much, haha..." She wipes some laughter induced tears from her eyes, "Not so old, you know I am. Much time do I have before worrying about what or who I leave behind," She says, seemingly trying to play off your question.`
			`	"Please, take this not as rejection, but, of me to begin a 'private relationship' with our first outsider would look very abusive," She attempts to explain, seeming almost... A little disappointed.`
			`	"Anything to ask, would you like else?" She asks.`
				goto questions

			`She nods a bit, perking up as the kettle begins whistling. She gets up, pouring you each a cup of boiling water, "A favourite of mine, this tea is. Sweet without additives, and light on the tongue," She explains, gingerly handing you a cup. You take a sip of the tea... It's sweeter than soda, as if a child had gone and dumped a liter of sugar in what can't be more than half that volume of tea.`

			`What was perhaps supposed to just be a short visit ends up lasting close to two hours as you and Papilana share stories of your early lives with one another. As it turns out, she grew up during a major technological revolution, when the Ancient Saryds went through a major update to their core boiler systems. This fostered her early love of science, and - in her excitement - ends up letting it slip that the Ancient Saryds (emboldened by the successful deployment of her new engines) are planning several new technological expansions in the coming months or years.`
			`	In turn, you tell her about your humble beginnings working in the dirt belt; a backstory she is surprisingly empathetic to, despite her much richer upbringing. It's a very relaxing afternoon; the most relaxed you've felt in years. For just an afternoon, it feels like the real world has backed off to let you breathe.`
			`	Eventually Papilana checks the time, eyes widening slightly, "Ah! Late it has gotten; away from me, time has become," She expresses, standing up, "Appreciated this greatly I have, Outsider, but duties I must attend to I have," She expresses.`
