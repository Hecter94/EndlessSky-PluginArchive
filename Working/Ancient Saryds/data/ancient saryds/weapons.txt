	description "A ship-grade autocannon used by the Ancient Saryds. This is their primary shipboard weapon, in favour of their still-developing energy weapons. It boasts good range and damage on target, feeding from 50 round belts of high caliber ammo."
	description "	As is Saryd culture, the weapon is designed to be operated by a team of 3; a gun commander and a two-man reloading crew."

	description "This simple turret is an Impact Driver mounted on a snappy turret base. The entire assembly is quite a bit heavier than its non-turret counterpart, but the long range and ability to rotate in any direction make it a valuable addition to any ship with the ability to use it."

	description "Some Ancient Saryds believe that the push for weapons that don't require physical ammunition is pointless, but those who don't have bound together this bizarre weapon. It appears to be an attempt at a large-bore cannon, but the large globs of superheated water vapor tend to break apart in flight, sharply reducing the weapon's effectiveness at great ranges."
	description "	Because it fires steam, it draws directly from the main supply on the ship, though the weapon thus fires cooler than most comparable weapons due to venting some heat each shot."

	description "This is a modification to the Geyser Flux Cannon, allowing it to swivel and fire in any direction, greatly increasing its usefulness. Though somewhat unreliable, Geyser Flux cannons are proficient at spraying fire over a wide area at midrange, so many Trainship conductors opt to delegate some steam to powering the weapon."

	description "This is what can be described as a heavily modified version of a common laser cutter developed by the Ancient Saryds during one of their latest electrical revolutions, greatly scaled up and adapted for offensive use. The weapon is vastly inefficient, but applies its tightly focussed beams of energy in precise points, allowing it to cut through shields in addition to ship hulls. The result is a weapon that, though somewhat crude by human standards, can nonetheless inflict severe damage."

		"piercing" 0.5
	description "Though the original stormcutter design was a remarkable success, some Ancient Saryd militia captains were worried that the smaller size of the Stormcutter meant that some of their weapon space would be going unused if the turrets were massed. As such, some crafty militia fighters hooked two of the Stormcutter lathes up to a slightly larger turret base."
	description "	Instead of just alternating the firing cycles, the two Stormcutters are designed to fire through a secondary amplification chamber, combining into a singular, far more powerful beam with improved range and shield piercing ability."

	description "Like any species, the Saryds' early generation energy weapons were low-powered, inefficient, and somewhat cumbersome. However, the Saryds have found success with energy based anti-missile; this turret, though short-ranged, is a very useful piece of equipment for shooting down debris headed towards the ship."
