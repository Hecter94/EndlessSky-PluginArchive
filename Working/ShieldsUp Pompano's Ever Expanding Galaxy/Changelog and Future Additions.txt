Changelog

													0.5.1 Tuk'ux Revival Update
													
													
	Thats right baby, we are back!!! I know I know, I slacked off. Its a habit. But its back and believe me, I have huge plans.
	Now, most of the changes in this update, these are all thanks to Derpy and FallenCat. Without them, this mod would still be
	at a standstill. FallenCat has helped slightly nerf a few of the outfits, mainly the Ion Torpedo Launcher and Shield
	Decimator, and has refined the images of the Decimators laser and impact. Thanks to Derpy for compiling all of the coding
	together, and for calling my ships ugly *cries in corner*. But in all honesty they were a bit ugly with that purple tint. So
	thank you Derpy for your help with that as well. He also helped seperate the coding and fixed the issue with the wormholes
	not having a purple line connecting them.
	
	Now some of you might be asking, 'Well Pompano, what if you suddenly stop working on it again?' And my answer is simple. I
	won't. I don't want Derpy screwing things up <3. A sneak peak into next update: Tuk'ux Fighter and it's outfits are reworked
	and should actually work this time. No more spoilers for now :P
											
										0.5 Tuk'ux Special Update Additions/Bug Fixes
											
											
	Added the Tuk'ux alien race. This currently includes 4 new ships; the Tuk'ux Battle Cruiser, Tuk'ux Battle Carrier,
	Tuk'ux Frigate, and Tuk'ux Cargo Ship. There were plans for a Tuk'ux fighter that will be spawned in with the Battle
	Cruiser however I ran into a bug with coding the ship and I was unable to fix it. A fighter will be included in later
	additions. I will put the current code at the bottom of this page so if anyone wants to help figure it out, they can.
	
	Along with 4 new ships, I added 2 versions of every necessary ship outfit and the Internal Security Measures. I have
	also added 2 new weapons, the Tuk'ux Plasma Laser and the Tuk'ux Quad-Blaster Turret. I have also given the Tuk'ux the
	Shield Decimator, and the Ion Torpedo bays.
	
	The Tuk'ux will currently have 7 Systems and 1 planet in each system. Check by Gammi Corvi if you are lost.
	
	As for bug fixes, luckily I haven't had too many problems so far. Special thanks to Toilethinges for pointing out a bug
	with me labeling the Riot Shield as Riot Gear in Delta V Outfitters.
	
	
															Alpha Additions
															
															
	Im just going to go read off the list. Added the Quarg Skydagger, Ion Torpedo Bay, Ion Torpedo, Tuk'ux Shield Decimator,
	Cellphone, Spy Watch, Spy Pen, Laser Pistol, Riot Shield, Basic Energy Shields, Advanced Energy Shields, the Skylance Rifle
	and the Skylance Rifle Rack, the 2 Quarg ships Quarg Rover and Quarg Warbird.
	
	
														To Do/Future Plans
														
														
	As of right now I plan on adding another Alien Species, more planets and ships and outfits (of course) and various missions 
	and storylines. Of course I welcome any and all images for outfits, ships, and coding help. I do currently need help fixing
	the Tuk'ux Fighter. I will put the coding below the end of this paragraph. Let's see where this mod goes!
