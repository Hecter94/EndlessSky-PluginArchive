# Endless Sky Korath Automation Upgrade
A plugin for [Endless Sky][endless-sky] which adds a new Korath Warship after the end of the Korath/Wanderer Co-Op Mission

Easier to capture than a Worldship, this 2.3 Tier Ship is obtainable after aiding the Wanderer/Korath in disabling the Kor Automata.
It does not replace the Korath Raider but rather complements it. If you do the Remnant Storyline after the Wanderer one, you will have an extra challenge with a few of these monstrosities. This Mod adds some challenge after beating the Automata out of Kor Efreti space
