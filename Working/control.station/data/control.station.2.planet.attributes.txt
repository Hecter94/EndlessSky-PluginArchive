event "remove planet attributes"
	planet Aava-Aasa-Khora
		description `This planet is the collective seat of what are known as the Old Houses, the noble families who held territorial claims to this region of space before the collapse of the Predecessors' empire and the arrival of the so-called New Houses fleeing their crumbling society.`
		description `		While today the planet is geologically stable, it has experienced major tectonic shifts in the past, folding the planet's surface into a number of visually spectacular canyons and mountain ranges. Since it serves such an important political role, tectonic activity on this planet is closely monitored, and even though there have been no major earthquakes since the Successors settled here, most of the buildings here are built to withstand even large and destructive geological shifts.`
	planet "Ablub's Invention"
		description `This ancient and quiet world, orbiting a dim red sun, is home to the microchip foundries of House Idriss, the Arach guild that specializes in computers and advanced electronics. Outside of the cities, which are clustered around the equator, Ablub's Invention is uninhabited except by the native lifeforms, including strange, spindly-legged quadrupeds, awkward birds with leathery wings, and amphibians with webbed feet and long, whiskered snouts.`
	planet Ada
		description `Ada is the home planet of Lovelace Labs, one of the most highly respected designers of starship systems and weaponry. Ada was originally settled as a mining planet, and the mines here still produce a steady stream of metal to supply the Labs and the many other industrial companies here.`
		description `		From above, the planet looks almost lifeless and barren. Most of the major cities on Ada are built into the walls of the canyons, where they are protected from the high winds and occasional dust storms that sweep across the surface.`
	planet Aera
		description `Aera is a large tidally locked ice giant close to its parent star. Its methane atmosphere is dominated by a titanic hurricane covering the dayside half of the planet, the result of tidal forces drawing streams of air and clouds into a planet-sized storm. The eye of the hurricane is surprisingly calm, but the heat of perpetual daylight drives temperatures higher than what is habitable for most life.`
	planet Aetuah
		description `The close proximity of Aetuah and the neighboring ice moon causes various ebbs and flows in the storms on the gas giant as well as constant reshaping of the moon's surface. The ice moon may have been captured by Aetuah in times past as a rogue planet, and the distance of the gas giant from the system center suggests it might be a rogue planet itself as well. In time, the gravitational force exhibited by Aetuah will tear apart the ice moon, plummeting it into the abyss.`
		description `		The most striking features of Aetuah are large oval-shaped organisms inhabiting the upper atmosphere. These lifeforms resemble some of the space fauna of nearby systems, and have a strange behavior of slingshotting themselves away from Aetuah once they reach a certain size through some unknown propulsion method.`
	planet Ahr
		description `The homeworld of the Arach people, Ahr is a metropolitan world with nearly nine billion inhabitants, enough that they cannot all be fed by what this world produces. The government maintains a storehouse with a month's supply of food in each major metropolitan center, as well as a collection of bioreactors, built according to Kimek designs, that can produce a tasteless but nutritious paste as emergency rations in the unlikely event that shipments of food from off-world are somehow disrupted for a prolonged period of time.`
	planet Aksaray
		description `At first glance, Aksaray appears to be a fairly generic moon formed from eons of dust and debris compressed into a tight ball by constant gravitational pressure. What is not commonplace is the presence of almost perfectly pyramidal piles of regolith scattered across the world. Querying an orbiting Remnant satellite suggests that these are believed to have been remote mining sites for mineral processing.`
		description `		A brief consultation of your navigational computer's economic database, however, indicates that all the minerals present in this variant of regolith are very common across the galaxy and have an extremely low value.`
	planet "Aktina Cylinder"
		description `The Aktina Cylinder is an incomplete space station of an enormous scale. Two dozen kilometers in diameter and three times that in length, when complete it will be able to house tens of millions of Avgi in urban conditions. Thousands of cylinders like these were built over the years in the Avgi core systems, but limited resources have constrained the Avgi in the Tangled Shroud to only building one over the last decade.`
		description `		With resources frequently reallocated towards new warships and mining installations, many wonder if the cylinder will ever be completed, which would provide enough space to allow the millions of Avgi in cryogenic storage to be revived. The main habitat body is still open to space, and the only area sealed against vacuum is a relatively small section tucked under what will be the habitat's "floor."`
	planet Alathil
		description `Eons later, Alathil still resonates with the shocks of the supernova that reshaped the Tap system. The entire atmosphere is still in turmoil, with layers of gas upturned upon themselves. These exposed layers are the source of Alathil's vibrant coloring, which is both beautiful and deadly.`
		description `		The planet's magnetosphere is grossly deformed, distorted by Tap's own powerful field and twisted by the shocks still resonating in Alathil's metallic hydrogen core. This bends streams of deadly charged particles emitted from Tap directly into the atmosphere, scouring seemingly random bands across the planet's surface.`
	planet Albatross
		description `Albatross is a cold ocean world orbiting a small, cold sun. The first settlers on Albatross were anarchists who believed that in a society free from unnatural laws and constraints, everyone would happily and freely work for the common good. The next settlers were pirates who believed that a planet free from laws and constraints would be a great base of operations.`
		description `		The anarchist farming communes, each operating independently but trading with outsiders to gain necessary supplies, are clustered in the barely temperate climate near the equator. The pirate bases, having a much more ready source of supplies, are located wherever there are flat landing areas close to craggy, defensible mountains.`
	planet Alexandria
		description `At the height of the Alpha Wars, the government of the Deep constructed Alexandria as the galaxy's largest storehouse of human literature, scientific writing, and technology. It also houses a vast museum of cultural artifacts dating back to long before the start of the space age. Today the station is mostly populated by visitors looking for particularly arcane writings or information, and librarians who have devoted their lives to keeping the archives well-indexed and up to date.`
		description `		Entire sections of the station are off limits to ordinary visitors. There are many rumors about what those restricted areas contain.`
	planet Alfheim
		description `Alfheim is a world of wide grassy plains, deserts, a few small oceans, and scattered rainforests. Not a pleasant enough planet to support large cities, it is instead mostly a site for oil drilling and manufacturing. So far only a tiny fraction of the surface has been developed, mostly clustered around the sites where the largest oil deposits have been discovered.`
		description `		Settlements show up as small bright points on the dark side of the planet - not from city lights, but from natural gas burnoff at the drilling stations.`
	planet Alix
		description `Alix is a small moon of the gas giant Pathera, lacking a breathable atmosphere but rich in minerals. While settlements on the moon have been destroyed to the extent that all that remains are debris scattered across the terrain, some automated facilities are still functioning and see a constant flow of cargo drones that stop by the moon to gather raw materials before quickly bringing them to the nearby station's reserves.`
	planet Allhome
		description `This Earth-like planet has been settled both by human beings and by the Hai, the species that controls this region of space. The human settlements are relatively small, mostly farming communities founded by people who came here to escape the chaos and uncertainty of human space. More substantial urban settlements exist, particularly near the spaceport, but from the air they appear to exist within strict boundaries.`
	planet "Alonis Observatory"
		description `Decades ago, this large observatory station was constructed in order to peer into the anomalous region known as the Ember Waste. Before the Avgi were able to harden their ships against the prevalent ion storms, this was their only way to extract its secrets. An array of advanced telescopes covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum sits side by side with more exotic equipment, from gravitational wave interferometers to neutrino detectors.`
		description `		After Avgi starships advanced to the point of being able to reliably withstand ion storms, it was trained deeper into the Ember Waste, looking further back in both space and time. It gathered an impressive amount of data before the Incursion forced its abandonment, though fortunately the telescope seems to have been left unscathed.`
	planet "Alta Hai"
		description `This is a complete Quarg ringworld, the product of millennia of construction effort which has consumed every other stellar object in this system in order to provide the raw materials. The inner edge of the ring is filled with solar panels, hydroponic gardens, living quarters, and sunlit common spaces. The outer edge contains hangars and docks for ships, and storage facilities for cargo.`
		description `		Massive station-keeping thrusters on the ring's exterior keep its orbit from becoming unstable.`
	planet Alvorada
		description `Formerly "Fortaleza da Alvorada," Alvorada was hollowed out centuries ago to make an extensive network of bunker complexes that used to house the Politburo of the CCOR and the extensive computer system they built that administered their centrally-planned economy. Rumor has it that, in the deepest reaches of the complex where no pirates have yet been able to breach, they're still there, having adapted the system to instead direct the guerrillas in the reestablishment of their homeland.`
	planet Amathil
		description `As far as desert worlds come, Amathil is merely dry and sandy, with a mild surface temperature that is surprisingly uniform across latitudes thanks to high altitude winds. While unattractive for settlement due to the scarcity of greenery, Amathil is still home to the descendents of those who arrived on the first few sublight starships, back when little was known about the planet besides that it had an oxygenated atmosphere. The unique culture that has since grown here, under a unified planetary government, emphasizes a sense of community and generosity - or at least that is how the locals like to be perceived by outsiders.`
	planet Amazon
		description `Amazon is a lush, green, tropical world, a popular tourist destination for many who live in this region of space. The indigenous forests are dense and hardy enough that growing human crops here is a constant battle, and none of the native plants or fruits are edible. Aside from tourism, most of the planet's income is from petroleum mining.`
		description `		The forests are home to a stunning variety of wildlife, some of it dangerous but most of it entirely indifferent to human presence. Plant life is so abundant here that even the oceans are green rather than blue, teeming with kelp and algae.`
	planet Anatrefo
		description `Anatrefo was discovered mere years after the Avgi discovered the hyperdrive, and was soon considered the most momentous discovery in Avgi history. An intact alien station, albeit one stripped of any advanced technologies, proved once and for all that the Avgi were not alone in the universe. Even more significant was a long, slender megastructure near the station, appearing as though construction on it had barely been started.`
		description `		While study of the station's structure was hoped to provide insights into advanced alien technologies, it has so far proven stubbornly difficult to understand or reverse engineer, with some Avgi scientists remarking that even the station's materials appear to intelligently circumvent attempts to probe their internal structure.`
	planet Angko
		description `Angko is a massive industrial world, with most cities on its surface supporting vast manufacturing sectors, factories, and warehouses. The level of industrial progress has not gone without its environmental impacts, however. At some time in the planet's past, the ice caps melted, causing sea levels to rise globally. The Bunrodeans have since moved to less environmentally negative practices, but the damage was already done, and the planet hasn't been the same since.`
	planet Anitlos
		description `The surface of Anitlos, the largest moon of Oura, is a smooth landscape of ice pierced by rocky, metallic protrusions. These surface metal deposits, brought by a late asteroid bombardment a few hundred million years ago, served as one of the best sources of material for the cylinder habitats that clustered around Oura, its moons, and its Lagrange points.`
		description `		The other moons of Oura, while not quite as rich as Anitlos, are nonetheless a bounty of rare materials. Notably, rare elements like boron and beryllium, only produced by cosmic ray spallation of elements like oxygen, are produced at elevated rates in the ice of certain moons due to the trapping of charged particles by Oura's magnetic field.`
	planet Antipode
		description `Antipode is a world of creeping glaciers and year-round snow, orbiting far enough from a dim star that even when the sun breaks through the clouds, it brings little warmth. The few settlements that exist here are built near surface deposits of rare earth metals that were discovered recently, and that are mined for use in electronics and equipment throughout this sector.`
		description `		The inhabitants of Antipode are among the best downhill skiers in the galaxy, and they have made some attempts to draw off-world tourists to the ski resorts here, but the weather is so hostile that they have had very little success.`
	planet "Antivli Station"
		description `Once one of many, this was an enormous synchrotron particle accelerator several kilometers in diameter, dedicated towards the industrial production of large quantities of antimatter. With beamed power provided by the thousands of solar collection satellites around Anax, enough antimatter could be produced each year to supply both Avgi research and industrial efforts. The discovery of the hyperdrive nearly wiped the antimatter economy out overnight, with interstellar travel now almost trivial.`
		description `		Combined, the amat farms around Anax once produced several tons of antimatter each year. The economic crash caused by the hyperdrive brought production to its knees, but the final death of Antivli Station appears to have come at the hands of the Aberrant.`
		description `The docks once used by specialized antimatter transport ships are wrecked beyond recognition, with only a small trickle of energy available. Beyond this, the beamlines once used to produce antimatter are broken and shattered - the antimatter plant is certainly beyond recovery.`
		description `		The station's stockpile of antimatter, hundreds of tons held in reserve as antihydrogen ice plated with a thin layer of antilithium, appears to have likewise been lost to the Incursion. Whatever happened to the antimatter, it is at least certain that it did not breach its magnetic levitation containment tanks, as otherwise nothing of the station would be left but vapor.`
	planet Aqra-Kvel-Taaq
		description `While this planet may have a rocky surface deep down, it is covered by kilometers-thick glaciers composed of water ice. Near the equator, a ring of craters push the ice up into circular ridges that cast long shadows across the landscape.`
		description `Covered in glaciers miles thick and bitterly cold, this planet is little more than a bleak ball of ice too far from its sun to be habitable. In the past, the Successors attempted to set up a shipyard here, but it eventually proved too costly to maintain and too poorly positioned to make up for it. Since it was abandoned, the Successors have made no further attempts to establish facilities here.`
	planet Arabia
		description `Arabia is an uncomfortably hot and humid world of deserts, savanna, and a few small and scattered rainforests. Large herds of bison-like animals roam the plains, providing the locals with a steady source of food. Occasional stampedes, involving tens of thousands of these animals, have been known to level entire towns here.`
		description `		Aside from hunting, most of the industry takes the form of harvesting and refining petrochemicals to make plastics, polymers, and oils. In some parts of Arabia, the pumpjacks outnumber the people a hundred to one.`
	planet "Arachne Station"
		description `Arachne Station is privately owned by Tarazed Corporation, and there are no services available here for people who are not Tarazed employees.`
	planet Araio
		description `Araio is a relatively small world dominated by a single supercontinent. Continental uplift has made much of the land characterized by mountainous highland, scattered with numerous springs and lakes. Though the air is thin and the soil is rocky, hardy plants and woody trees cling to life, breaking up the landscape of rocky mountains with colorful meadows and bountiful forests.`
		description `		Araio garnered a reputation as a frontier world ripe for plucky pioneers, reminiscent of an oft-romanticized era on Aviskir. While rich in gemstones, natural stones have not been competitive with nanofabricated alternatives since long before the planet was settled, and thus the economy on the surface is almost completely dominated by homesteads and small frontier towns.`
	planet "Aresepru Nat"
		description `Now that the Korath are gone, the oceans on this planet have begun to teem with fish and other living creatures once again, and the levels of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide are slowly swinging back into balance. Species of algae and bacteria that are able to metabolize the plastics and chemicals that the Korath left behind have spread throughout the oceans.`
	planet Arroharg
		description `Arroharg is a low-gravity moon that the Quarg have converted to some sort of harvesting grounds. Massive machines that dwarf your ship seem to be displacing mountainous formations while smaller ones collect from the zones left behind. Most of the architecture here is Quarg-like and is not designed in a way that welcomes visitors very comfortably. The lower levels of the outpost seem to dig deeper into the surface of the moon, but the farther they go down, the more complex they become. There's no telling how deep into the moon they go, as they are restricted to everyone but the Quarg.`
	planet Asgard
		description `Asgard was one of the first worlds to be settled in the Deep. It is now home to many crowded cities, with soaring skyscrapers that are made of lightweight composite materials rather than the steel and concrete so commonly used elsewhere.`
		description `		This is also the home of Deep Sky, a manufacturing firm that produces a wide variety of expensive and useful starship equipment.`
	planet Ashkelon
		description `An otherwise mundane rocky world, Ashkelon is littered with thousands of basalt monoliths. Most are cracked, many others reduced to rubble, and a scant few are intact enough for the deep carvings that cover their surface to be read. These glyphs were seemingly designed to be easily translated, which Avgi researchers quickly did. There was much excitement when it was realized that the monoliths contained instructions and advice on various technologies, but this quickly turned to disappointment when a years-long survey revealed that no monolith had information on anything more advanced than the steam engine.`
		description `		Whoever left the monoliths here either never documented their more advanced technologies, or someone went to the trouble of destroying the monoliths that contained them.`
	planet "Ashy Reach"
		description `The thin, unbreathable atmosphere and low gravity mean that Ashy Reach will never become popular as a residential world, but it serves a useful role as a hub for shipping and commercial exchange. There is only one settlement here, built around the spaceport, and consisting mostly of pressurized underground caverns. Outside the settlement, the planet's surface is drab and almost lifeless.`
	planet Aspar
		description `A rarity in the Tangled Shroud, Aspar is a habitable moon with a temperate climate and a thriving ecosystem. Widespread settlement has been prevented, however, due to the unfortunate fact that life on Aspar uses proteins with the opposite chirality to those used by life on Earth and Aviskir.`
		description `		As a result, the native flora and fauna are mostly inedible, sometimes even poisonous, and the composition of the soil is such that imported plants tend to be stunted even if they manage to survive.`
	planet Asphodel
		description `Despite being nominally in the habitable zone, this planet's surface is continually scorched by the stars of Gacrux and their solar flares, steadily blasting away its atmosphere. A joint venture of three major universities from Chiron has placed some small research stations in orbit around Asphodel, and while they provide valuable insights into the nature and behavior of flare stars, the researchers generally avoid descending to the planet's surface unnecessarily. None of the stations appear to have the facilities to service your ship, however.`
	planet Aspiration
		description `The world of Aspiration appears to be a mild, habitable world, but one currently in an advanced ice age now slowly retreating. The equatorial region of the planet is warm and comfortable, a cool temperate at the present time. The native biosphere seems to be mostly grasses and something resembling pine trees. In a few thousand years, it might look similar to Earth before it was paved over. For now, it's a sparse world with a single major town built on a promontory, overlooking a wide river mouth which carries runoff from continental scale glaciers to the sea.`
	planet Asterus
		description `The seas beneath the frozen surface of this ice moon are home to a thriving ecosystem full of species entirely unlike any observed on other, more habitable worlds. The best known of these is a species of large fish-like creatures with flowing bioluminescent fins that glow in ethereal pinks and purples, the beauty of which prompted many citizens of the Paradise Worlds to demand that Parliament designate the entire moon as a nature preserve in the 2900s.`
	planet Avalet
		description `Avalet is a hot ice giant, similar in size to Neptune but orbiting far closer to Anax. Tidally locked, one face of the gas plant is heated to incandescence while the other experiences temperatures cold enough to freeze the water and ammonia out of its mostly hydrogen atmosphere. This drives a cycle of winds that ring the entire planet, producing immense cyclones capable of throwing clouds to the edge of space.`
		description `		The erosion of the solar wind against Avalet produces a bright cometary tail visible from Aviskir, and in multiple Avgi mythologies the planet occupied a role of preeminence: a messenger, or a king, or even a creator. In more modern times, the antimatter trapped by Avalet's magnetic field fueled Avgi starships until Antivli Station was built, a fading reflection of its mythological significance.`
	planet Aventine
		description `This is not a particularly warm world, but it is the best that the first Remnant refugees were able to find when they explored the Ember Waste. It is here that they built their capital, in a deep valley that is almost always shrouded in clouds. In meadows farther up the mountain slopes, a few particularly hardy food crops are grown, but for the most part the Remnant rely on artificial greenhouses or cultured yeast for protein supplements. Remnant cuisine is unlikely to ever become a draw for tourists, even if their isolation here is broken.`
	planet Aviskir
		description `Aviskir is a world of sweeping mountains and sparkling oceans. It also happens to be the Avgi homeworld, bustling with nine billion members of the species. Civilization has concentrated largely around bountiful mountain valleys and fjords, many warmed by hot springs and geothermal heat. The largest cities are built around the smaller peaks, laced with slender bridges and bright skyscrapers. They stand in contrast to the rural valley settlements below, which are said to offer simpler, more traditional lives.`
		description `		The Incursion has forced the remaining Avgi on the surface to dedicate a large part of their industry towards building defensive missile systems and banks of lasers, all in the hope of turning away the attack runs the Aberrant sometimes make on the surface.`
	planet Babiali
		description `Babiali's surface is a bona fide example of cataclysm. Ice and rock extends from horizon to horizon, with vast networks of cracks and fissures suggesting it was subject to some kind of sudden force fairly recently in its geological history.`
		description `		At present, Babiali has a regular stream of mining and research craft systematically flying over the crust looking for rare metals or anything else of value. Despite the activity, no one has bothered to set up anything resembling a spaceport.`
	planet Baianus
		description `From a distance, this large, icy moon is superficially reminiscent of Enceladus back in Sol: it is similarly exposed to its giant parent's radiation belts, and scans indicate countless tantalizing traces of chemicals that suggest there may be something more to the moon than it appears.`
		description `		Unlike Enceladus, however, the surface of Baianus is regularly wracked by both waves of heat and energy. A stay of any length on the surface is likely to see waves of auroras swirl through its unbreathably thin atmosphere, accompanied by glows and sparks rippling across the terrain. Your environmental system strongly recommends remaining inside your ship whenever ion storms are active.`
	planet Bailey
		description `Bailey is a dead, nearly tidally locked world scarcely larger and more habitable than Mercury. As the planet slowly rotates relative to its host stars, its hot side is blasted into a molten wasteland, while its cool side hardens into a mineral-rich crust, a rarity in this region of space.`
		description `		Like aphids sucking the sap from a plant, semi-mobile mining stations strip and refine the minerals, a method originally developed by the Confederated Councils. Since their fall, the pirates of the region have maintained the stations - although with considerably less organization than what was upheld by the central government.`
	planet "Bank of Blugtad"
		description `This idyllic planet is home to almost as many Arachi as their homeworld in the neighboring system. It is also home to House Plumtab, the Arach guild in charge of banks and finance. Because pretty much every other sector of the Arach economy depends on loans from House Plumtab and trades stock on their equity exchanges, this House is quite influential throughout Arach space.`
	planet "Belug's Plunge"
		description `Although it is in Arach territory, Belug's Plunge is a cold enough planet that most of the native population is Saryds rather than Arachi. Most of the industry here focuses on mining metals and exotic elements to be used in building new extensions to the Rings. There is also a Saryd materials research lab trying to learn how to duplicate the advanced composites used by the Quarg. But Belug's Plunge is best known for the Academy, where cadets for the Heliarch defense forces are trained.`
	planet Beryl
		description `Beryl is a small space telescope deployed by the Gegno Scin to observe a nearby section of space home to mysterious dark nebulae and black holes. Only select Scin scientists are allowed to acquire research data from Beryl, which is otherwise not publicly accessible.`
	planet "Big Sky"
		description `Big Sky is a warm and fertile world, teeming with indigenous life. It would be an ideal farming world if it were not for the fact that the native plants are so abundant and so well adapted to this environment that they can take over an untended field in a matter of months. Farmers typically start the growing season by slashing and burning the plants that have taken root in their fields over the winter, and even so they must be constantly vigilant for weeds throughout the summer.`
		description `		The Big Sky government recently financed a major project to genetically engineer a goat species so ravenous that it can control the growth of local vegetation. These "ubergoats" pose so great a threat to the typical biosphere that they are export-controlled as biological weapons.`
	planet Bivrost
		description `Bivrost is the one planet in the Deep where heavy metals are relatively abundant. What began as a mining colony has developed into one of the most prosperous worlds in the region.`
		description `		Unlike most worlds that are strip mined for uranium, the environment outside the cities is relatively unspoiled. Strict controls are placed on the emissions and waste products of the local manufacturing plants to ensure that it stays that way.`
	planet Bloodsea
		description `Bloodsea is nearly uninhabited, except for a few pirate outposts. Its name comes from the planet's oceans, which are blood-red due to rhodophyte algae. Although the climate is temperate and there are many white sand beaches, no one comes here hoping to go swimming.`
		description `		The pirates have no industry of their own, but instead make a living by reselling stolen cargo from raids on merchant fleets.`
	planet "Bloptab's Furnace"
		description `The surface of Bloptab's Furnace is rich in mineral deposits but too hot for any but the hardiest plants and insects to survive. The locals live deep underground in caverns carved out by the same automated mining machines that are used for collecting ore on the surface. When maintenance is needed for the surface robots, crews of engineers will wait until nightfall and then emerge from underground and do their best to complete the repairs before sunrise.`
	planet "Blubipad's Workshop"
		description `Dozens of small cities dot the valleys and hilltops of this warm and pleasant forest world. Due to a high tech manufacturing industry, there is plenty of work here for all the inhabitants, who hail from planets throughout Coalition space. With broad streets, ample parks, and gleaming skyscrapers, the cities bear witness to the very best of what Coalition society can accomplish when the three species work together.`
	planet "Blue Interior"
		description `Blue Interior is a strikingly beautiful earthlike world, covered mostly in oceans but with regions of rainforest, desert, mountains, and frozen tundra. Billions of Kimek live here, and there are also large Saryd and Arach populations in the cities whose climates are most agreeable to them. The Coalition often presents this world as a model of how their three species can benefit from sharing space with each other.`
	planet Bluerun
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Bluerun seems to have been mainly built for civilian habitation, but extensive mineral processing facilities indicate that ore refining was once a sizable industry here. No doubt the designers of this station sought to take advantage of the large number of metallic asteroids in this system and process ores stationside.`
	planet Bluestone
		description `The sunlight that filters through Bluestone's atmosphere is too dim and reddish for ordinary Earth plants to thrive. The native plants, mostly grasses and lichens, have adapted their own unique chlorophyll-like molecules in response.`
		description `		Bluestone is sparsely populated. Aside from one small research village dedicated to cultivating edible hybrid crops that can grow on similar worlds, most of the industry here is focused on drilling and refining oil to make a variety of plastics.`
	planet Bosunothro
		description `Bosunothro is a major mining world, and also home to some of the largest shipyards in Bunrodean space. Larger shipyards than the ones found here only exist on the capital world of Erabuthro.`
		description `		The planet's success as a mining world can be owed to its many deep canyons found across most of the planet's above water surface, which allow for easier access to mineral-rich deposits in the crust. The major shipyards developed alongside these mines allowed for easy transportation of material directly to the shipyards instead of requiring lengthy journeys through space.`
	planet Bounty
		description `All the land near Bounty's equator is desert, but closer to the poles, the weather is temperate and there is enough rain for farming. The land near the northern pole is sparsely populated, but the other hemisphere is quite well developed, with many of the inhabitants now working in factories that produce fancy watches and intricate electronic components.`
		description `		The focus on skilled manufacturing has had a dramatic effect on both the local education system and the sports scene. One can garner great respect - and a sizable income - simply by being the best at folding tiny paper cranes by microscope.`
	planet Bourne
		description `Bourne is a well-developed industrial world that was first settled four centuries ago. Its cities are home to some of the richest individuals in this section of the galaxy, but also home to tens of thousands of homeless people, and many others whose factory jobs are barely providing enough to make ends meet.`
		description `		Outside the cities, the climate is somewhat dry, but the deep valleys and some coastal regions are suitable for farming. Very little of the planet remains that is untouched by human hands.`
	planet "Brass Second"
		description `This is a farming world. In the century prior to their discovery of space flight, billions of Kimek starved in a series of increasingly severe global famines. Fourteen thousand years later, their culture is still haunted by fear of not having enough food, and in response they have developed enough farms in their region of space to feed a population three times their size. Much of the food that they produce each year is either put into storage or simply recycled back into fertilizer for next year's crop.`
	planet "Bright Echo"
		description `This is the first world that the Saryds colonized outside of their own solar system. Although somewhat colder than their native planet, it developed into a thriving metropolitan world. The original settlers planned out in exacting detail how every part of the planet's land mass should be used, in order to satisfy their aesthetic ideal of blending residential areas with parks and farms. Large areas have also been set aside as undeveloped wilderness.`
	planet "Buccaneer Bay"
		description `Pirates who have struck it rich dream of retiring on Buccaneer Bay. It is a warm ocean planet, with many places reminiscent of the islands in the ancient Caribbean where humanity's greatest pirate fleets sailed.`
		description `		Many of the inhabitants are in fact not pirates, but their descendants, and these children and grand-children of anarchist outlaws have built a system of regional government that oversees hospitals, schools, and other public services, all created without funding from the Republic or taxes paid to it. The planet even sports its own shipyard, although many of the ships built here are, not surprisingly, based on designs pirated from the Syndicate and Republic shipyards.`
	planet "Builder Settlement"
		description `This asteroid has seen hundreds of thousands of years of excavation done by swarms of Ka'sei drones. Although its size rivals that of a small moon, a large section has been hollowed out by the Builders to be filled with iridium, presumably as a long term storage facility. Due to its very low gravity, the asteroid is permanently covered in clouds of dust that hover only a few meters above the surface.`
	planet Bunthro
		description `Despite being a pristine world for colonizing, Bunthro appears to be almost entirely untouched by the Bunrodea. Aside from the spaceport, there are hardly any structures on the planet, most that you can find being small shrines built atop high locations such as hills or mountains.`
		description `		Permission to land is even more restricted than the capital; the entire world of Bunthro appears to be a religious site of some sort to the Bunrodea.`
	planet Burthen
		description `Burthen is only sparsely populated due to crushingly high gravity. The locals - exceptionally strong and short - take a stoic pride in this misery and the many health issues that result.`
		description `		The land in most regions is suitable for farming, but mining of heavy metals is the primary industry, and the source of ready wealth that ties people to this uncomfortable planet.`
		description `		Some of the excavation vehicles used here are as large and costly as a capital starship and as noisy as a volcano. Vast scars of strip mines span across the landscape. On this planet the environment is something to be endured rather than cherished.`
	planet Byruca
		description `Judging by Byruca's distance from its host star, you would assume that the planet would be habitable, albeit a little on the hot side. But as you approach, you find nothing but a lifeless wasteland; the surface of the planet looks as though it once harbored a teeming ecosystem, but now there's nothing but dead trees and deserts.`
		description `		As you observe more of the planet, you even managed to find evidence of intelligent life in the form of entire towns and cities of buildings, but they all seem long abandoned.`
		description `		Your ship's sensors detect high levels of ultraviolet radiation, and cursory scans of the atmosphere reveal a distinct lack of ozone or any other gas that would prevent the nearby star's UV light from reaching the surface.`
	planet Caelian
		description `When the first members of the Remnant discovered this region of space, Caelian was the only habitable world they found with enough insolation to be able to operate solar-powered factories and bioreactors. The first settlements were scattered widely, with the houses hidden underground in order to be less visible from space, because they feared that the Alphas would overrun human space and eventually find their way into the Waste. Centuries later, when they learned that the Alpha Wars had ended, they began to expand the factories and settlements more openly.`
	planet Calda
		description `Calda is a tropical resort world, a pleasant place to unwind after a few days skiing on its sister planet, Vail. The most popular tourist destination is the hot springs, and the spa complexes that have been built up around them. Constant pesticide use has nearly eliminated insect pests. Because of the uncomfortably warm and humid summer months, the very rich view Calda more as a tourist destination than as a place to live.`
		description `		In Calda's early days as a spa planet, a nearly silent eruption of carbon dioxide filled a resort valley and suffocated the whole population. This incident shocked the Paradise Worlds and led to a very large drop in tourism here. Fortunately for Calda's economy, this effect ceased within six months, which was about how long it took for most potential tourists to forget about the incident.`
	planet Calesi
		description `Calesi is a binary planet, orbiting a common barycenter with its sister world, Pelesi. While Calesi is a molten world, heated by tidal forces, Pelesi remains cold enough for its surface to be covered in a thin layer of ice.`
		description `		Despite this, Calesi remains the more hospitable of the pair, as the powerful magnetic field generated by its molten core focuses charged particles from Soar onto all parts of Pelesi's surface, painting it with a deadly flood of ionizing radiation.`
	planet Canyon
		description `Canyon is a large world, with gravity near the high end of what human beings can comfortably bear. Much of its surface is sandstone, leading scientists to believe that the planet was once home to large oceans, before some cataclysmic event, perhaps a rogue star drifting through the system, caused much of the planet's water to boil away. The few settlers who live here mostly farm the deep canyons; the mesas above are dry and almost lifeless.`
		description `		The angular rock formations that cover most of the mesa land are identified in local mythology as the ruins of an unspeakably vast and ancient alien city. A gullible tourist can find any number of opportunities to tour these alleged sites. Off-world science has been largely skeptical of these claims.`
	planet Capitoline
		description `The harsh landscape of Capitoline is a demonstration of the forces of nature at work. Lava flows and eruptions are regularly seen, and seismic activity is a daily occurrence. As a result, the surface is of comparatively recent origin. Despite this, you can spot a small survey station in the middle of an old lava field. In response to your landing computer's query, the transponder issues a terse statement about the automated scientific station and a warning that its defense systems are active.`
		description `		Heeding the warning, you land over the horizon from the station. Stepping out onto the surface, you can feel the rumble of the planet beneath you. Despite the ever-present seismic heaving, it feels like you can pick up a subtle pulse in the vibrations. The impression never goes away, but neither you nor your sensors can determine an actual pattern.`
	planet "Carbuncle Station"
		description `Carbuncle is a tiny station owned and operated by Lovelace Labs. You assume that like most such stations, it is primarily a deuterium refinery, but aside from the docking bay the rest of the station is closed off to visitors. Given the reputation of Lovelace Labs for exotic research, there could be almost anything beyond those sealed-off bulkheads.`
	planet Cassandra
		description `In the late 2300s, Cassandra was the subject of one of the most ambitious terraforming projects performed by humanity up to that point; an attempt to rapidly modify its biosphere and jumpstart the process of making the planet more than perfect for human habitation.`
		description `		The project never came to be. For an as-yet-unexplained reason, some collapse or chain of destruction occurred during the terraforming project that made Cassandra uninhabitable, and ever since Cassandra has been discreetly left out of the public record by the terraforming industry.`
		description `		This appears to have been an ocean-covered planet when the terraforming project was initiated; almost everywhere you go is a dry and dead salt flat in every direction, occasionally rising steeply up into pale watersheds and ranges where rivers and islands once were.`
	planet Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej
		description `This planet is hot and dry, and holds on to only a tenuous atmosphere. Several enormous alien installations are present on its surface: semicircular bubbles that smoothly emerge from the rock as if they were grown from it, dotted with small pores which are each large enough for a starship. Inside them, the temperature is surprisingly quite habitable and you can observe the remains of what look like mines and industrial facilities within.`
		description `Once an important industrial planet for the High Houses of the core systems, Cavasaa-Vasa-Tej was a hub for the mining of rare elements and for the growth of exotic metal in the superheated corona of the Kasii-Cavaasa star. Shipments from here continued even as the hyperspace links from it started to deteriorate, leaving many freighters stranded in deep space after they fell out mid-jump. Without maintenance, most of the stellar metallic gardens here have long since fallen into Kasii-Cavaasa's outer layers, but the few that have survived by chance are now completely overgrown with threads of hyperdense alloy; enough to supply the facilities of Cavaasa-Vasa-Tej's industry for years, if they were still operational.`
	planet "Ceaseless Toil"
		description `The Saryds prefer to build their largest factories on sun-drenched, uninhabitable worlds, in order to allow more hospitable planets to be used for residences and recreation. Where possible, their factories harness solar power: either using mirrors to concentrate sunlight for solar foundries, or collecting energy through large fields of solar panels. The factories are almost entirely maintained by robots, which are capable not only of repairing damage but also of constructing entire new factories according to predefined plans.`
		description `		The solar collectors are mounted on frames about ten meters above the shifting sand dunes. In addition to turning to face the sun, they can be turned upside-down as necessary to dump off any sand that accumulates on them.`
	planet Ceilia'sei
		description `Apart from one large, solid module, very little of this space station remains intact: the cloud of debris surrounding the core makes docking with it very difficult, and one side of the station even appears to have been blown up. The other part, however, has suffered much less damage, and the surface bristles with dozens of well-maintained turrets.`
	planet Celeatis
		description `Celeatis is a barren planet with mountains covering most of its surface. Even in the few flat highlands, the terrain is too sterile for any kind of vegetation to grow naturally. On some slopes, the outline of an outpost can still be recognized, but they are all uninhabited: some of the villages have been partially destroyed, and large amounts of dust cover the remains to the point that the original color can't be recognized anymore.`
	planet "Celestial Third"
		description `Celestial Third is the breadbasket of Kimek space. Most of its land mass is used for farming, augmented by seaweed farms and fisheries in the oceans and factories near the equator producing yeast and bacterial cultures as nutritional supplements. The first settlers came here more than thirteen thousand years ago, at a time when their home world had run out of arable land for farming and food was desperately needed.`
	planet "Charon Station"
		description `Charon Station provides hyperspace fuel for much of the southern galactic rim. It is a tiny, cramped, and aging station, with twice as many workers here as it was originally designed for.`
		description `		Centuries ago, before much of the Dirt Belt was settled, this was the first spot below Algorel where merchant caravan fleets from the Deep could stop over on their way to the worlds farther up the Rim.`
		description `		The close quarters have fostered an extreme scrupulosity about personal space. It is unnerving to walk down a densely crowded hallway and fail to make eye contact with anyone.`
	planet "Charybdis Station"
		description `Charybdis Station is privately owned by the Syndicate. It is a massive deuterium refinery, with harvester drones constantly flying in and out to scoop hydrogen gas out of the upper atmosphere of the planet below. If you need to repair or refuel in this system, you will need to visit the neighboring world of Delve, instead of this station.`
	planet Chiron
		description `Chiron is the only planet outside the solar system that was colonized by humanity prior to the discovery of the hyperdrive. It is now the second most populous planet in the Republic, with many sprawling cities and a burgeoning pollution problem.`
		description `		Although Earth still has the most prestigious universities in the galaxy, Chiron has become the de-facto leader in higher education, catering to those who value excellent teaching more highly than an illustrious name. As a result, off-world students form a noticeable fraction of the population.`
	planet "Chosen Nexus"
		description `The Saryds established a trading colony here in the early days of their era of space exploration, when they first made contact with the Quarg. When the Quarg gave them the gift of a small number of jump drives, in order to build relationships with the neighboring species, Chosen Nexus grew into a far larger and more important trading hub.`
		description `		It has now been many millennia since the Quarg were driven out and free travel began between the members of the Coalition, and Chosen Nexus now has nearly as many Arach and Kimek inhabitants as native Saryds.`
	planet Chyyra-Raaqa-Tuur
		description `This snow-covered planet orbits a dim star, making its surface dark and bitterly cold. Near the north pole, there are signs of large-scale excavation, possibly for materials to construct the station that orbits it.`
		description `During the arrival of the New Houses, this planet was briefly considered as a location for permanent habitation. However, the dim star it orbits produces very little heat and makes the planet uncomfortably frigid, even for the cold-tolerant Successors. Furthermore, its lack of substantial natural resources exempted it from use as an industrial or mining planet, and it continues to remain uninhabited.`
	planet Cipi
		description `Cipi's forests and mountains are a suitable place for the Gegno Scin's less active population, home to more quiet industries. The population of this planet is limited, and architecture is built high in mountain ranges to avoid hurting the natural landscapes of the planet. This provides the Scin with healthy crop and hunting seasons to supply their main population without the interference of polluting industry.`
	planet Clark
		description `Clark is a recently settled world, and most of its surface remains covered in dense forests and uninhabited mountains. Because clearing new land is so difficult, agriculture here has not grown far beyond the level of subsistence farming. But the temperate climate has drawn tens of millions of settlers, most of whom work in factories that have been planted here by off-world corporations to take advantage of the cheap labor.`
		description `		The low cost of living and virtually zero unemployment rate make poverty and crime relatively rare occurrences. Instead there is a pioneering spirit, a startup-world attitude that anything is attainable with a bit of hard work and frugality.`
	planet Clink
		description `About a decade ago, a mining corporation from Zug planted a colony on Clink for harvesting some rare earth minerals that are present in this moon's crust due to its unusually high rate of asteroid impacts. The atmosphere here is too thin to breathe without a respirator, and because of the low gravity, the dust raised by the mining operations hangs perpetually in the air.`
		description `		The miners who work here are a tight-knit group, since most of them were part of the original colonization team. They are not particularly open to outsiders, and the facilities here are so rudimentary that they do not even stock fuel for visiting ships.`
	planet Cloudfire
		description `Cloudfire's atmosphere is unusually hazy, with almost constant cloud cover, making agriculture unproductive here even though it is a warm and damp environment. There are several major cities here that were abandoned centuries ago, due to conflict with the Unfettered. The one major city that remains is the closest thing the Hai have to a military base, with new supplies of weapons and ammunition constantly pouring in from the rest of Hai space.`
	planet "Cold Horizon"
		description `In the early mornings on Cold Horizon, the trees are often coated in a thin layer of glittering frost that burns away a few hours after sunrise. In the short summer season, flocks of migratory birds arrive in the forest, bringing a cacophony of music and a riot of color to the otherwise serene woodlands.`
		description `		Half a billion Saryds live here, drawn not so much by the planet's resources, which are scarce, as by its natural beauty.`
	planet "Cool Forest"
		description `Much of Cool Forest's land mass is covered by the sort of temperate woodlands that the Saryds prefer to build their residential neighborhoods in. The total population is over a billion, but living in small settlements so well integrated with the surrounding forest that from space only a few major cities are visible.`
	planet Cornucopia
		description `Cornucopia is a mostly agrarian world, and like several of its neighbors it has been inhabited since the early days of interstellar travel, when settlers seeking to get as far as possible from old Earth and its troubles landed here.`
		description `		Through careful stewardship and attention to the rhythms and balances of nature, generation after generation of farmers have transformed this world into one of the most fertile in human space. The Cornucopia College of Agriculture is famous, and justly so.`
		description `		From orbit, most of the landmass seems covered with a bizarre pixelated pattern. On approach, this resolves into a vast patchwork of fields and irrigation circles.`
	planet "Corral of Meblumem"
		description `The Corral of Meblumem is home to two major industries: uranium mining, and longcow ranching. The long lifetime of the longcows means that their bodies can easily accumulate dangerous loads of heavy metals if exposed to them, so the two industries are kept separated by conservation zones dozens of kilometers wide. The dark strips of primal forests separating the red-brown pit mines from the tan and light green of the pastures makes the land look like a stained glass patchwork from above.`
	planet Covert
		description `Covert is home to a powerful mining cartel, operating outside the control of Republic law or any other external authority. It is rumored to be one of the few planets in human space where weapons-grade uranium and plutonium is mined and enriched. Any goods for sale here were most likely produced by slave labor, often by survivors of ships that have been captured by pirates. A massive pirate fleet is docked on the outskirts of the spaceport, a warning to any private pilot who might think of cheating or opposing the cartel.`
	planet Crataegusa
		description `At a distance, Crataegusa has a plain appearance, with linear shear cloud lines circling the planet. Beneath the surface, however, the atmosphere is a turbulent maelstrom of cyclonic winds at odds with the surface appearance.`
		description `		As you skim through the clouds your sensors report intense energy fluctuations from all directions, some of which echo the readings from the wormholes.`
	planet Crossroads
		description `Crossroads is a thoroughly unbeautiful planet. The scrawny local vegetation has blue and purple leaves, shocking to your human eyes, and grows only reluctantly, leaving the land looking like a blighted wasteland.`
		description `		The Syndicate's vast operation strip mining for uranium ore does nothing to improve this situation. They say that sandstorms were frequent here even before the Syndicate arrived, but the storms have gotten far worse in recent years, with some storms now reaching several kilometers high and dozens of kilometers in diameter.`
	planet Cyife
		description `This lonely, icy moon is the only non-gaseous celestial body within this rather quiet star system. Although there are no signs of life here due to the extremely low temperatures, certain parts of the surface glimmer oddly compared to others, as if to imply something may once have been here before.`
	planet Cyreal
		description `Cyreal was one of the first extrasolar worlds to be colonized by the Avgi, and, as with the other neighboring worlds, it was settled by slower than light starships. During a period of widespread scattered settlement, this low-gravity moon's sharp mountains and tall forests became popular with asteroid miners grown weary of cramped spacecraft. When the hyperdrive brought unprecedented immigration from other worlds, conservationists set aside large swathes of the moon as natural preserves, concentrating most residents in a small group of dense cities.`
		description `		While somewhat metal-poor itself, by exploiting the asteroids and other bodies in the Span system, Cyreal developed a robust industrial base that allowed it to weather the economic shock that came with the invention of the hyperdrive relatively easily.`
	planet "Dagon Station"
		description `Originally built in the 25th century as a corporate military outpost, Dagon Station's notoriety stems from its past as a privateer base; its infamous mercenary fleets all but decided the victors in the constant wars in this region during the 26th and 27th centuries. As those conflicts subsided, those privateers began turning towards piracy. Their influence was brought to an end when a fleet from Earth took control of the station, later becoming a military base for the fledgling Republic.`
		description `		In the 29th century, control of Dagon Station was passed to the Syndicate, who eventually vacated the station due to its age. Local laws prevent landing on Dagon Station without a permit, but the Syndicate doesn't pay close attention to whether or not anybody lands here, anyway.`
	planet Dancer
		description `Dancer is a resource-rich world, but with unusually violent weather and strong atmospheric convection, which leads to lightning storms stronger than on any other settled human world. Straying outside on foot is unthinkable, and it is not uncommon to find a small crater blasted out by a particularly energetic strike.`
		description `		A fair number of scientists have settled here to study the planet's weather systems, as well as others who do not mind, or who even enjoy, the wild weather. It might be possible for terraforming to moderate Dancer's atmospheric activity enough to make it a less dangerous place to live, but the cost would be prohibitive.`
	planet Darkcloak
		description `Darkcloak is a world that is almost always obscured by a thick layer of clouds, making it difficult to produce food here.`
		description `		Although the Hai tend to be an easygoing and nonviolent species, there are always a few in each generation that yearn for excitement, warfare, and conquest. These "Unfettered" Hai have built a major military base here, and they launch raids from here on convoys traveling through the nearby systems.`
	planet Darkmetal
		description `Darkmetal is a cold, dry mining world, the source of much of the heavy metals that are used in Hai space. A haze of slightly radioactive dust hangs in the sky whenever it has been more than a week since the last rainstorm. Most of the mining is carried out by slow-moving vehicles the size of a small city, which ingest layers of dirt and bedrock, crush it to extract any valuable elements, then mix the remaining material with water to form a concrete-like slurry that can be extruded in solid blocks, to reduce the amount of additional dust that is added to the atmosphere.`
	planet Darkrest
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		The presence of a solemn plaque that takes up a sizable portion of the nearest wall seems to commemorate an engineering malfunction that occurred thousands of years ago, when this station was still inhabited. In a freak accident, an entire habitation section of Darkrest lost power and depressurized, causing the deaths of countless civilians. Thousands of years later, no one knows for sure what caused the incident. Legends, stories, and conspiracy theories have blossomed from the event.`
	planet Darkstone
		description `Darkstone is a rainy, mountainous planet. The major continents are spidered with rivers and green valleys. A few enterprising settlers have built farming communities here, but the population remains low because of the threat of piracy from neighboring systems.`
		description `		Among the farmers who choose to stay, the attitude seems to be that piracy can't last forever, but good land will always be good land. Despite some low-level cynicism and bitterness, there is surprisingly little outright anger at either the pirates themselves or any government that might have been expected to control them.`
	planet Darkwaste
		description `This planet seems to have all the conditions necessary for a vibrant, Earth-like ecology. The gravity and temperature are moderate, and there is a fair amount of surface water, although the oceans are quite small. However, aside from a few stunted plants and lichen, there is almost no native life here. Given how skilled the Hai appear to be at terraforming other worlds, it is strange that this one has been left barren.`
	planet "Deadman's Cove"
		description `Deadman's Cove is an ocean planet; the continents take up only a tenth of its surface area. Legends tell of massive sea creatures hiding in the deeps: serpents hundreds of meters long; colossal sea turtles; strange tentacled monsters and exotic fish.`
		description `		One island archipelago is home to the spaceport, the only part of the planet where it is safe to land uninvited. The other islands - even some that seem from a distance to be uninhabited - are often used as staging bases for pirate fleets, who guard their secrets closely.`
	planet Deep
		description `Deep is a sparsely populated world of small island archipelagos surrounded by vast expanses of empty ocean. There is not enough land for any large cities or serious industry to emerge, so most of the inhabitants live in small fishing villages. The climate is temperate and Earth-like, but the sunlight is somewhat dimmer than you are used to.`
		description `		The fishing settlements are actually the second colonization attempt on this planet. In the early days of hyperspace travel the Kingsburg Corporation sent out what was then one of the largest and most technologically advanced colonization fleets, penetrating deep into the then-unexplored southern galactic rim. After two centuries of sporadic and guarded contact, the colony fell silent, and when human expansion finally reached this area again, no trace of the original colony was found.`
	planet "Deep Treasure"
		description `Thick layers of kelp and plankton sediment have gathered on the floors of Deep Treasure's oceans over the eons, leaving behind rich deposits of oil that the Saryds harvest to make plastics and other hydrocarbon products. In the shallower seas, shoals of fish swim among some of the most varied and extensive coral reefs found anywhere in Coalition space.`
	planet "Deep Water"
		description `The upper layers of Deep Water's mantle are unusually hot, resulting in continuous volcanic eruptions that shroud its skies in ash and particulate matter. Aside from one small continent most of the surface is ocean, but the volcanoes have formed hundreds of separate island chains and archipelagos, each of which is home to unique plant and animal species.`
		description `		To preserve the planet's rich biodiversity, the Saryds do not allow permanent settlements to be built on the islands, but village-sized research stations have been built that can be anchored near an island while scientists work there.`
	planet "Deka Dathnak"
		description `For whatever reason, someone has gone to the trouble of bombarding this gas giant with thousands of nuclear warheads. Swirls of radioactive isotopes are plainly visible in the lower atmosphere, and the amount of soot floating around points towards a large amount of some material having been incinerated in the recent past. The Korath were presumably the ones who decided to drop several gigatons worth of nuclear weapons into this gas giant during their civil war, but exactly why they did so remains unknown.`
		description `		Unfortunately there is no eerie green radioactive glow to illuminate the layers beneath the clouds. Instead, your ship is shrouded in shadow and ash, plunging your viewports into darkness.`
	planet "Deli Kasi"
		description `Deli Kasi is a world of vast oceans and mountainous continents. At many locations across the planet, the tall mountain ranges trap moist air from the oceans, causing large amounts of rainfall in concentrated areas. This, combined with snow melt from the mountains, creates large fertile plains across much of the habitable land area, which has led to Deli Kasi becoming a major farming world.`
	planet "Deli Kat"
		description `Deli Kat orbits the dimmest star out of any of the inhabited systems in this region of space, a star not too dissimilar to Sol. Although the planet orbits farther from its host star than Earth does, its slightly thicker atmosphere seems to balance that out, resulting in a mostly Earth-like climate. The planet's many vast plains and river systems additionally help to make Deli Kat a fertile farming world.`
	planet Delodir
		description `Delodir is proof that life can exist even in the most unlikely of places. Despite the moon's lack of sunlight, given that the Mote system has no bright, luminescent star, life has managed to thrive at the bottom of Delodir's subsurface oceans, buried deep beneath a thick layer of ice. Energy is trickled into the biosphere from hydrothermal vents, which are in turn powered by tidal heating produced by the gravitational influence of both the brown dwarf and gas giant within the system.`
	planet Delve
		description `Delve is a world of towering mountains and valleys so steep that some slopes never see the light of the sun, where snow and ice remain on the topmost peaks year-round.`
		description `		The Syndicate's mining operations here are among the most extensive in the region, with some shafts descending several kilometers below the surface. Some of the mines are as large as a city, and in fact many of the mining cities are under ground, built in sections of old mines that have long since run out of useful metals.`
		description `		With all the mines and underground cities reliant on mechanical ventilation from the surface, the miners live in constant fear of two things: cave-ins, and power failures.`
	planet "Delve of Bloptab"
		description `This is a mining world, hotter than even the Arachi would prefer but still much more habitable than its sister world of Bloptab's Furnace. It is home to House Ablomab, the guild of mining and metalworking, and the dry climate makes it possible to store stockpiles of iron, steel, and other metals here without worrying about rust. Supposedly the warehouses here contain enough raw materials to double the size of the Heliarch war fleet if needed; the Arachi like to be able to trust that they are prepared for any eventuality.`
	planet "Desi Seledrak"
		description `Plumes of soot and ash rise from a cluster of several dozen volcanoes on this planet's main continent, shrouding the planet in a thick layer of clouds and choking out the sunlight. The ruins of several Korath cities and the geometric grids of cleared land surrounding them show that this was once a farming world, but now few plants are able to survive and kilometer-high glaciers have begun creeping down from the poles. It may be centuries before the skies clear and this world begins to thaw.`
	planet Devil-Eye
		description `There are a few sturdy mesas on which to land, but most of this planet is rough rock and dirt. Despite the lack of sunlight, the surface is warm. There must be internal processes in the planet generating heat. The scanners on your computer show a network of caves reaching deep below ground. There's high radiation in the caves, too much to support human life. Crystalline formations that coat the cave walls block detailed scans. Advanced geological scanners might enlighten you further.`
		description `		There are automated deuterium refineries on this planet, siphoning deuterium from cave walls. The refinery equipment looks Hai in origin. Some mesas have fuel pumps, filling containers with fuel for later transport to the planet's moon.`
	planet "Devru Kaska"
		description `The Kor Sestor prefer to develop planets rather than planting stations in space, but this is a necessary exception: a deuterium refinery that harvests hydrogen both from the gas giant it orbits, and from the strong solar wind from this system's primary star.`
	planet "Diligent Hand"
		description `On this factory world, robotic workers operate the factories, repair themselves, and keep the solar power stations free of sand with very little direction or assistance from their Saryd creators. Each factory complex has its own landing pads for the freighters that drop off raw materials and receive the processed goods.`
	planet Disara
		description `Disara is a highly developed world, with multiple large cities on each of the planet's continents. Each of the cities spread out into more suburban-like regions, which extend further into rural and wilderness zones. Unlikely many other worlds, Disara has no one primary industry that it dominates in. Instead, the planet does a bit of everything, having a rather strong internal economy.`
	planet "Dlia Jzaur"
		description `Dlia Jzaur has a few hotter seasons than normal due to the binary stars at the system's center, where beautiful eclipses can be seen weekly. The much smaller secondary star is believed to be a rogue captured by the larger one, but it is slowly drifting away. There seems to be evidence of recent colonization efforts by the Gegno, but they appear to have been abandoned due to increasing warfare in nearby systems.`
		description `		Oddly enough, Dlia Jzaur has many unnatural looking formations on the surface that seem to reach up to the sky in areas where eclipses often occur. The formations are hollow underneath, but show no signs of Gegno involvement.`
	planet "Dokimi Range"
		description `This distant planetoid, far from anything of importance, has been designated as the Twilight Guard's dedicated weapons proving ground. Aside from a small outpost, which hosts a laboratory exclusively geared towards data collection and analysis, the surface is a barren wasteland of gleaming nitrogen ice and reddish tholins.`
		description `		From orbit, the scars of previous weapons tests are subtle. A grid of craters in an unusually regular pattern, large boulders reduced to heaps of slag, clear lines of bright ice sliced across the reddish surface: the Avgi have left a mark upon this world, where no one exists to complain about it.`
	planet "Double Haze"
		description `The haze that perpetually blankets this world is actually an organic soup rich in nutrients and airborne bacteria, and the rain that falls here forms a sort of natural fertilizer. The entire planet's surface, including every quiet nook or alleyway in the cities, is covered in moss, grass, shrubs, or other green and growing things.`
		description `		Billions of Kimek live here, working either in the farms or in the mines and factories that operate in the hill country where harvesting crops would be more difficult.`
	planet "Drekag Firask"
		description `Much of the surface of this world is covered in water. Ships the size of small cities float in the oceans, carried by the tides. The ships are designed to incubate algae and other microorganisms that once provided the Korath both with food and with a source of mixed hydrocarbons similar to petroleum. With the Korath gone and the food no longer needed, many of the ships have fallen into disrepair, or have drifted into the polar regions and been crushed against icebergs.`
	planet "Dueitch Ae"
		description `In order to pursue biological and other important scientific research, this green, lush world was designated as the Gegno Scin's capital. Much unlike the heavy industry of the core Gegno worlds, Dueitch Ae's surface still supports many natural ecosystems, and most importantly, is home to a notable amount of water bodies. The Scin effectively limit their expansion on the planet, even at the cost of their population's growth, in order to preserve the flourishing life on it as long as possible.`
		description `		Although preservation is a primary goal, the Scin still manipulate the planet for the sake of research. Even if it's not harming the environment directly, patches of the planet have been converted into large experimentation grounds, some a bit less humane than others.`
	planet "Dueyu Eitch"
		description `The historic homeworld of all Gegno, Dueyu Eitch is a rugged, rocky world covered with enormous metropolises and megastructures. Each city is based on an elevated platform, and starting from the bottom up, the buildings are more advanced the farther they reach into the sky. Larger cities are lit by the varying reds and oranges of industrial forges, and more urban areas are speckled with yellow and green. Beneath the heavily populated surface are traces of enormous cavities, suggesting the Gegno began a majority of their ancestry in the ground.`
		description `		Three distinct subspecies can be seen walking about: one that is very bulky and scaly in appearance, another slimmer and more bony, and the third a combination of the first two; all stand at heights varying between those of a human being and a Quarg.`
	planet Dune
		description `Dune is a mostly desert world, which was uninhabited until very recently when geologists discovered that the bedrock under the desert is home to many rare mineral deposits and gemstones.`
		description `		Most of the inhabitants live deep underground to avoid the hot sunlight and frequent sandstorms. It is a dangerous life; cave-ins are common in the mines, and the sand on the surface can shift so suddenly that it is not uncommon for one of the underground villages to find its surface entrance buried, and to need to call for help from another village. But the mines operate with a joint ownership model where all the workers profit equally, so working here pays well. Many of the miners stay here only for five or ten years, while sending money back to their families off-world.`
	planet "Dusk Companion"
		description `Dusk Companion's moon is so large and orbits so close to the planet that the tidal forces even affect the planet's plate tectonics. The skies here are frequently blanketed in a volcanic haze. This world is rich in oil deposits, a relic of a past when more life flourished here, but drilling for oil is costly because the shifting ground can damage drills or seal up previously productive bore-holes. Since this also makes processing difficult, the oil is exported off-world for processing into plastics, instead of having the manufacturing performed locally.`
	planet Dustmaker
		description `The surface of this planet, when it is not obscured by dust storms, receives enough sunlight to power not only large solar farms, but solar furnaces as well, which the Hai use for manufacturing a large variety of goods. Some of the solar farms are so large that from orbit, the light reflecting off them could almost be mistaken for lakes and small oceans. However, there is almost no water on the planet's surface except near the poles.`
	planet "Dwelling of Speloog"
		description `With a wide band of tropical rainforests around its equator, this planet's climate is ideal for the Arachi. Several billion of them live here, and many of the workers assisting with the expansion of the Heliarch ringworlds come from this planet.`
	planet Earth
		description `The ancestral home world of humanity, Earth has a population twice that of any other inhabited planet. Sprawling cities cover large portions of its surface, many of them overcrowded and dangerous. Some people work to scrape together enough money to leave, while at the same time others, born on distant worlds, make a pilgrimage of sorts to see this planet that once cradled the entirety of the human species.`
		description `		Earth is also the capital of the Republic. Representative government becomes complicated when one planet has a greater population than a hundred planets elsewhere. As a result, settlements of less than a million are grouped together into planetary districts that elect a single representative between them - a source of much frustration in the frontier worlds.`
	planet Eavine
		description `Although its climate is very cold and most of the surface is covered in snow, Eavine has a crust rich with rare metals and minerals hard to find elsewhere. Entire valleys on the surface have been completely stripped of their resources, likely used in the massive complex of half buried buildings which appears to be the only settlement on this moon that remains today.`
	planet Echo
		description `This is a small Quarg outpost, which you suspect was built mostly to keep an eye on Tarazed Corporation and their alien-influenced research on the planet below. Like most Quarg worlds, the gravity is much too low here for it to be a feasible human colony, and although there is an atmosphere, it is too thin for a human being to breathe. Supposedly the Quarg have lungs designed for a continuous one way airflow, like a bird's lungs, rather than the ordinary in and out flow of human lungs; this is what enables them to survive on low-gravity, low-atmosphere worlds.`
	planet "Eeu Mnai"
		description `In contrast to the flourishing world of Mnai, Eeu Mnai is a dull dwarf planet composed mostly of rock and stone. While still within habitable range of the system's binary stars, the surface of this world is rough and jagged, and is dominated by cold fall and winter seasons. This environment is not inhospitable, however, as various forms of life, such as subterranean mammals and insectoid creatures, have adapted to these conditions.`
	planet "Ef Aourtdye"
		description `Ef Aourtdye is primarily a factory world where a large portion of mined materials are refined, processed, and re-distributed across parts of Gegno space. Large factory and refinery structures can be seen engraved into the mountainous surfaces of the planet, with some cities found in less crowded valleys. Once home to a much larger population, a major portion of the cities are now desolate as efforts have been pushed to either more distant planets, or pulled back to the ever-growing homeworld of the Gegno.`
		description `		A majority of the mining, cargo, and refinery vessel shipyards in Gegno space are also found here, newly constructed out of the freshly processed materials and quickly prepared to be put into service.`
	planet "Ef Osch"
		description `Ef Osch is the first world found by the Gegno to have a substantial part of the surface covered in water. Pristine beaches surround tropical land masses, and many strange creatures occupy the depths. Despite being appropriated by the Gegno Scin, there is a relatively low amount of construction work done on the mainland. Most industrial work takes place on large, vessel-like complexes that travel the oceans.`
	planet Eldergrasp
		description `A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. There is a generously appointed reception area with an orderly on duty who informs you that this is a respite home for the elderly, and unless you have family here, you will not be permitted to wander the station.`
		description `The spaceport is virtually non-existent, with just a single cafeteria, a fuel pump for the desperate, and a dedicated loading area for loading and unloading the facility's regular deliveries. Despite its small size, everything is in excellent condition.`
	planet "Elek Kartanu"
		description `You have no idea what has happened to this planet, and you are not sure you want to know. The atmosphere is unusually hot and wet for a planet this distance from its sun, and the ocean levels seem to have dropped significantly in the recent past, leaving barnacles and bleached coral exposed to the air all around the shorelines. The wind is frenzied and full of wild energy, and the fog moves like a living creature.`
	planet Elenchus
		description `Beneath the surface of this small moon, there is a network of corridors and large rooms. The architecture looks mostly human, but with a hint of Hai. Most are blocked off by sturdy doors with keycard access and plentiful security cameras. Frequently, you see a symbol similar to the Syndicate logo. Everywhere you walk, a security camera turns to track your movement. You get the feeling that you're not welcome here.`
	planet Elthe
		description `Elthe's parent gas giant, Sef, hosts a rich system of rings and moons chock-full of valuable minerals. Lucrative returns made by independent miners attracted many settlers from Araio who became discontented with planetary life, leading to the rings of Sef becoming a wild frontier, one with orbital tether robberies and mass driver shootouts.`
		description `		By unspoken agreement, the airless moon Elthe, which was found to contain the only significant deposits of fissiles around Sef, became something of a neutral ground. Settling old scores or resolving disputed claims the "usual" way is heavily frowned upon here, and as such offworld companies felt safe enough to establish trading posts here to ship out the vast quantities of minerals mined around Sef.`
	planet "Ember Gegno"
	planet "Ember Graveyard"
	planet "Ember Reaches"
	planet "Ember Threshold"
	planet "Ember Twilight"
	planet "Ember Wormhole"
	planet Eminonu
		description `Eminonu's notably green rocks show a remarkably high copper content and the historic presence of atmospheric water. Scattered vegetative debris suggests that this world was, until recently, some variety of garden planet, albeit likely a cold one. Today the vast majority of moisture is locked up in ice fields, and the ambient temperatures are far too cold for even hardy lichens to survive.`
	planet Enbye
		description `A cold, mountainous world on the very edge of the binary system's habitable area, Enbye maintains the massive shipyards of the Gegno Vi, using raw resources gathered from the nearby volcanic planet to churn out hull after hull for warships. Many large canyons decorate the surface and are used as weapon test sites, and in one of the largest canyons lies a shipyard several times larger and older-looking than the rest.`
		description `		On closer inspection, the method that created the canyons does not seem entirely natural, and there are slight glints of light shimmering down in the deepest regions. You haven't seen anything like this on other Gegno worlds.`
	planet "Enn Bue"
		description `Lengthy oval-like shipyards speckle the surface of this otherwise inhospitable desert planet, home to most of the Gegno Scin's ship production. A majority of material wealth comes from the neighboring gas giant's moons; however, the strong gravitational pull occasionally generates natural disasters that ravage the surface. Despite all of this, the Scin remain vigilant and efficient in their craftworks.`
	planet Entantel
		description `Entantel is notable in that it is almost entirely comprised of water ice. With a diminutive rocky core, its low average density results in a very low gravitational acceleration for its size.`
		description `		Because of its shallow gravity well and abundance of volatiles, Entantel was one of the biggest exporters of water ice in the outer Anax system, where it was largely used as cheap propellant or to fill the numerous cylinder habitats with artificial lakes and rivers.`
		description `The spaceport here launched most upmass via a space elevator that was destroyed in the Incursion. Enormous blocks of ice would often be shipped wholesale, with little refining done on-site, and so despite the abundance of water, there is barely enough deuterium fuel stockpiled here to fill a few large tankers.`
	planet Erabuthro
		description `Erabuthro is the capital of the Bunrodean Hegemony, home to the throne of the Queen. Only those with the blessings of the Queen are allowed to set foot on the planet's surface, although receiving such blessing doesn't necessarily guarantee a warm welcome.`
		description `		Much of the planet's land area is covered in a hexagonal pattern of city and wilderness, with every hexagonal urban area bordering an area of wilderness, as if the planet consisted of one giant city with hundreds or maybe even thousands of parks scattered across it.`
	planet Eragarthro
		description `Eragarthro is a large ocean moon of a moderately sized gas giant in the system of Eragaru Le. Although orbiting a gas giant means that the moon is often cast in shadow for multiple days at a time, the planet that the moon orbits is also firmly in the nearby star's habitable zone, making it a not too unpleasant place to live.`
		description `		This moon is also home to the Bunrodea's most prestigious academies, including the Royal University of Dogen and Military Academy of Fuhtiiski.`
	planet "Ergastirio Station"
		description `When Consonance researchers' need for plentiful space and isolation outgrew what was available on Peripheria or Navigeo, dedicated as they were to habitation and shipbuilding respectively, this mid-sized station was built to accommodate a state-of-the-art collection of laboratory facilities. The work here is largely aimed towards weapons research, a necessary consequence of the fight against the Aberrant.`
		description `		The facilities are surprisingly comfortable for what you might expect from a research station, a deliberate attempt to boost the productivity of the scientists that live and work here. Labs for all sorts of applied energistics, nuclear research, and even hyperspace experimentation form wings around the central habitation core, which is home to tens of thousands of scientists and engineers as well as a sizable support staff.`
	planet "Esayaku Fen"
		description `The Kor Mereti robots seem to prefer to build their factories and refineries in space rather than on planets, harvesting their raw materials from asteroids so that they do not have to deal with gravity, or atmosphere, or rain, or sandstorms. They have left this desert world unoccupied.`
		description `		The deserts here are home to an unusual number of plant species, which have adapted to survive the occasional catastrophic flash floods.`
	planet "Esek Stovar"
		description `This Kor Mereti outpost is far enough from the front in their war with the Kor Sestor that it has fallen somewhat into disuse. The largest docking bays are still kept open for refueling and repairs, but the sections of the station that used to be living quarters have been sealed off.`
	planet "Eskar Kortuka"
		description `This is a barely habitable frozen world. The Korath built nothing here except for a few small mining facilities, now abandoned. There is no sign that the occupants were forced to leave by violence. Rather, it seems that they simply packed up their things one day and moved out. The buildings they left behind are now half-covered by snowdrifts.`
	planet "Esperaktu Station"
		description `This small space station has plenty of blast marks on its outer hull, but they have all been patched and the interior still holds atmosphere. But although still intact, the station is entirely abandoned.`
		description `		For food, the Korath set up vats of photosynthetic yeast and bacteria in some rooms on the outer shell of the station. In their absence, the bacterial soup has worked its way through the ventilation system into the rest of the station and formed a thin layer of slime on almost every sun-facing wall.`
	planet Esquiline
		description `Esquiline's wispy skies billow with raging winds and continuous storms. The Remnant have discovered that its upper atmosphere contains a useful source of certain chemicals. Although few spacecraft can penetrate its depths, specially-designed aero scoop drones can be seen regularly dipping into the atmosphere for shipments to Aventine.`
	planet Essime
		description `Starting from an early age, most Vi devote their lives to their endless trials of survival, finding themselves either on the frontlines of conflict or in the backlines of industry. As they grow old, they retire and spend the rest of their lives on green planets such as this one, where they hunt animals for food and till acres of land.`
	planet Esstch
		description `This hot desert world is the first world the Gegno left their imprint on outside of their home. Littered about with various recording instruments of times past, Esstch represents a historical stepping stone for the Gegno. However, due to the proximity of the system's star, it is too hot to be colonized.`
	planet Everhope
		description `This station consistently has a large number of Hai warships docked at it, and further investigation reveals that it serves as the principal supply of fuel for the Hai military, as well as the staging point for resupplying ships heading to defend Wah Ki from the Unfettered. A monument beyond the docking area entrance attests to its history performing a similar role during the Korath raids before that.`
	planet "Factory of Eblumab"
		description `The tiny sun that the Factory of Eblumab orbits is too small to provide much power, so the manufacturing plants here are mostly powered by nuclear reactors running on radioisotopes that are mined and refined locally. It is a hot, dry, and mostly barren world, and most of the workers here are young and single, hoping to build up enough wealth to move somewhere more pleasant.`
	planet "Far Garden"
		description `Saryd culture places high value on connection to the natural world and to settings suitable for silent reflection. This is one of their most populous worlds, but even in the cities more land is set aside for parks and wild spaces than for buildings.`
		description `		Farther out from the city, the Saryds live in communal buildings that each house up to a dozen families, surrounded by gardens and cultivated forests. Unlike on many human worlds, here the most remote real estate locations are often the most valuable.`
	planet "Far Home"
		description `The weather on Far Home is a nearly perfect blend of what is most comfortable for each of the three member species of the Coalition. The mountains and boreal forests have been settled by the Saryds, the grasslands and savanna by the Kimek, and the rainforests by the Arachi, even though this is technically part of Saryd territory.`
		description `		This world is also home to the annual Coalition Games, where athletes from throughout Coalition space compete. The winners become eligible for immediate elevation to Heliarch rank.`
	planet "Far'en Lai"
		description `When the Korath were banished to the Core, they were left with only one living world, a planet they call "Far'en Lai," meaning, "the last candle-flame." Afraid that this planet's biosphere will turn to dust in their hands like all the other worlds they once controlled, the Korath have left Far'en Lai entirely unsettled and unexploited. It is rumored that the terms of their exile dictate that if Far'en Lai withers and dies, the remaining Korath exiles will be exterminated, but that if they can learn to make the planet flourish, their place in the galaxy will be restored.`
	planet "Fara Skaeruti"
		description `This station serves both as a deuterium refinery and as a factory. A large number of small spires protrude from the hull of the station, each carrying fuel pipes, so that ships can simply dock with one of the spires to refuel instead of having to navigate inside a hangar.`
	planet Farpoint
		description `Farpoint, on the northernmost end of human space, is a rocky desert planet home to a Republic Navy base and not much else. Farming is possible only within greenhouses, and this system is too far from the galactic center to be desirable for trade or industry.`
	planet Farseer
		description `With enough money, you can buy a sunny day. Farseer is an ocean resort world, where much of the local tax revenue is spent on the terraforming equipment that moderates the weather. Real estate prices fluctuate wildly in times of political anxiety, because the idyllic climate exists only by government fiat.`
		description `		Industry here mostly takes the form of executive offices for interplanetary banks, law firms, and software companies. Strict zoning laws limit construction of skyscrapers or factories to the continents that are in the less pleasant polar regions.`
	planet Farwater
		description `In human space, this system would probably have been left unsettled, because its sun produces too much ultraviolet radiation for animals to survive for long on its surface. But the Hai have instead turned this warm ocean world into a massive incubator for photosynthetic algae and bacteria. Each species is genetically engineered to produce one or more medical or nutritional compounds that they can make use of. Barges travel slowly through the oceans harvesting these microorganisms out of the water and separating out the chemical compounds they provide.`
	planet Featherweight
		description `Featherweight is a small world, with lighter than normal gravity. Centuries ago, because of its remoteness, this world was the site of some illegal genetic experiments, and rumors say that the current inhabitants are the result of those experiments. Because they are so well adapted to low gravity, few of them choose to leave, and very few outsiders choose to settle here, so this world's culture remains quite insular and detached from the rest of the galaxy.`
	planet "Fek Rembatu"
		description `Everything on this planet that is made of metal is overgrown with a thick layer of a reddish lichen or fungus. In the cities, the tallest buildings look like they have been melted or half digested by the fungus: tall towers lean at crazy angles, and smaller buildings are entirely buried and indistinct. The air smells like sauerkraut and roses.`
	planet Felorap
		description `Felorap is a hot, steamy ocean world, with a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide and water vapor. Despite being a fairly old planet, periodic asteroid bombardment has deprived it of the reprieve needed to develop complex life, and so the biosphere remains confined to extremophiles around the many hydrothermal vents that can be found on the ocean floor.`
		description `		In a layer of oceanic sediment not too far from the surface, the fossilized remains of a few invertebrate multicellular creatures can be found, the last remnants of an evolutionary line that died with a cataclysmic impact event a few million years ago.`
	planet "Fenrir Station"
		description `Fenrir Station is a bustling refinery, and from the way the foremen looked at you when you stepped off your ship, they seem to be eager for new recruits. In addition to harvesting deuterium, this is one of the few refinery stations in human space which also collects helium-3, an isotope with some exotic uses in medical imaging and in energy research.`
		description `		The diversity of isotopes found here is partly due to the station being a relatively new construction and benefiting from modern technology. But the gas giant which the station harvests from also has a composition unlike any other known planet. One theory is that it is on the cusp of becoming a brown dwarf star, in which case the isotopes now being stirred into the upper atmosphere by convection will eventually be depleted by fusion.`
	planet "Feo Platform"
		description `Hastily assembled from the parts of a mothballed interstellar laser driver, the Feo Platform is an enormous free electron laser intended to provide fire support to Avgi fleets defending the Tangled Shroud from Aberrant invasion. While a few Aberrations sometimes manage to slip past, the beam together with the fleetgroup the platform supports have so far managed to hold the line.`
	planet Fertriery
		description `Fertriery is a fairly typical world with a particularly dense atmosphere that includes significant levels of chlorine and fluorine. The only unusual factor is the above-average temperatures, likely due to the decreased energy loss into the surrounding space.`
	planet Firefall
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Dwarfed by the nearby Quarg ringworld, Firefall is nevertheless capable of holding countless Hai. The station, like others of its type in Hai space, was once used to house those who migrated from the Hai's crumbling galactic empire. Now it is quite literally a shell of its former self, having been emptied of all non-essential equipment long ago.`
	planet Firelode
		description `The Unfettered are operating several large strip mines here to collect uranium and plutonium to fuel the generators in their warships. Older, abandoned mining pits are scattered throughout the planet's surface. As a result of the mining activity, the groundwater here has become badly contaminated.`
	planet "Firka Tesk"
		description `This appears to have once been an inhabited world, and the remnants of a few cities still remain. But the planet's crust has been cracked like an eggshell, releasing rivers of lava and leaving behind unnaturally steep mountains and fault lines. The wind whistles and howls through the rifts and fissures as if the planet itself is screaming in pain. A thick haze of sulfur dioxide and ash hangs over everything.`
	planet Flood
		description `The scenic fjords and rugged mountains make Flood a popular tourist destination. Nearly all the land in the planet's temperate zone is covered in mountains, making traditional agriculture difficult.`
		description `		The locals subsist mainly on sheep and goats, plus a few native species, and grow fruit and vegetables in small terrace gardens tended by hand rather than by tractor. Most of the population is employed in the tourism industry, running inns for the visitors to their quaint mountainside villages, or making handcrafts for sale as gifts.`
	planet "Flowing Fields"
		description `During the rainy season, the plants on Flowing Fields grow so rapidly that the grass can tower more than three meters tall. Although they look verdant and serene when viewed from a distance, the grasslands are also home to many dangerous predators, including hundreds of species of snakes and ferocious packs of carnivorous rodents that can bring down animals many times their size. During the dry season, the rodent packs build domed hutches out of woven grass and mud where they shelter from the sun and the dusty wind.`
		description `		Most of the Saryd dwellings are in the temperate forests, but they have converted almost a tenth of the grasslands into farms.`
	planet Follower
		description `Follower is on the edge of the Paradise Planets region of space: not really one of them yet, but aspiring to be. It is prosperous, but from manufacturing rather than law or finance or venture capitalism. A significant fraction of the local taxes collected here are being spent on terraforming, raising global temperatures and reducing seasonal fluctuations. The goods produced here always have a ready market to purchase them, so Follower's job economy is considered very stable.`
		description `		As one of the few planets still actively engaged in terraforming, Follower has been the location of several experiments with new technology, trying to leapfrog the centuries-slow process that other worlds have gone through. Unfortunately most of these experiments have failed, sometimes spectacularly.`
	planet Forpelog
		description `Forpelog is a Quarg mining world, barely habitable by their standards and, because of its low gravity, unsuitable for long-term human habitation. The Quarg city is a marvel of advanced technology, entirely enclosed within glass and steel, with gardens and terraces where alien trees and plants grow. Outside the city, the landscape is rugged and beautiful, but the atmosphere is too thin to breathe and contains almost no oxygen.`
	planet Foundry
		description `Foundry is home to Syndicated Shipyards, where more than half of the commercial freighters in human space are manufactured. Although much of the planet is blanketed in smog from the factories, there are also regions of pristine forests and majestic mountains.`
		description `		The Syndicate has a generous vacation policy on Foundry that allows workers to take as much as a month of vacation time every year, and many choose to take that time to escape from the cities and explore the wilderness. The shipyards claim that this vacation time is partly responsible for the high reliability of the ships built here, because a well-rested and relaxed worker is less likely to make the sort of mistakes that can quickly become disastrous in outer space.`
	planet "Fourth Shadow"
		description `In all of Coalition space, this is the one planet that comes closest to deserving being called a slum world. More than ten billion Kimek live here, mostly in densely packed and run-down apartment buildings on the outskirts of the cities. Unlike more prosperous Coalition worlds, the city centers here are reserved for factories rather than for parks or government buildings or civic centers.`
	planet Freedom
		description `Freedom is home to the oldest and largest anarchist colonies in human history. The original settlers arrived in the first century after the invention of the hyperdrive, coming with the goal of simply getting as far away from civilization as possible. The colony has reinvented itself countless times since then as different leaders have taken control, and in fact at present it is split into two separate towns, East Mesa and West Mesa.`
		description `		The environment is a mix of deserts and brackish oceans, with a fair amount of native wildlife and good potential for farming. Anywhere else in human space, this planet would have become densely settled, but out here it has remained mostly empty.`
	planet Frostmark
		description `There are several large Hai cities near the equator on Frostmark, but much of the planet's surface is cold and uninhabited except by herds of extremely large, six-legged herbivores, and other equally large and frightening animals that prey on them.`
	planet Furnace
		description `Furnace is a nearly uninhabited world, used mostly as a waypoint for shipping and as a staging point for the Syndicate fleets that seek to keep this region of space free from pirates. The atmosphere is barely thick enough to be breathable, and none of the plants that grow here are useful for eating. However, because it is only a large moon instead of a full-sized planet, moving cargo and fleets of ships to and from its surface is fairly easy and inexpensive.`
		description `		Conducting any business here is a nightmare of tedium. Syndicate doctrine claims that corporate structure and process produce a leaner and more effective military force without the perceived wastage of the Republic Navy. But in practice, they seem to have combined all the worst aspects of military and corporate bureaucracy.`
	planet Gagarin
		description `Gagarin is the most populous planet in what used to be the Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim, and it was one of the first colonies established in this region. All of the settlements on Gagarin are connected to a planetary transport and infrastructure grid... although the grid hasn't been able to keep pace with Gagarin's growing population. Despite having been designed for expansion commensurate with increasing demand, such a resource-intensive infrastructure project became harder and harder to maintain due to continuous supply shortages. The collapse of the CCOR has only exacerbated the grid's deficiencies.`
	planet Gamla
		description `Unlike most fictional portrayals of precursor species, the previous inhabitants of this dry, salty moon did not leave behind any ancient technological ruins or monolithic stone constructs. Instead, the evidence of their past existence is in the form of tapped mineral veins, concentrations of unmistakably artificial radioisotopes, and a wide belt of orbiting debris degraded to little more than lumps of metal and dust.`
		description `		Before they were able to penetrate deeper into the Ember Waste, Gamla was the first evidence the Avgi found of the Antecessors, a species thought to have inhabited the eastern part of their space millions of years ago. While the moon contains no surviving examples of Antecessor technology, it engrossed xenoarcheologists for years.`
	planet "Gara Pvu"
		description `Beautiful landscapes cover this planet, and unlike nearby systems, the climate is more than welcoming to a human being. Most remarkably, there are small selections of elegant curved structures and overpasses spread out in patches along the surface. While they are fantastical in appearance, they are unmistakably not part of the land itself, and must have been left long ago by some other species that also managed to leave the natural beauty of this planet intact - either that, or it's been so long since their disappearance that nature has retaken everything.`
	planet "Garden Empyreal"
		description `Not including the trio of Quarg ringworlds, this is the largest megastructure in Coalition space. Arrays of gigantic metal pyramids lay at every angle, each nearly a dozen times larger than the average space station. Spread out over the planet's upper atmosphere, these so-called "hubs" are connected by long, inextensible, and extremely sturdy wires, ensuring no part of the structure is destabilized.`
		description `		First devised by the Kimek before the Coalition's war against the Quarg, the structure was completed relatively recently, about two thousand years ago. Populating the gas giant's uppermost atmosphere lay several hardy species of artificially engineered bacteria, periodically being "scooped" by the lower body of each hub and then later mass-produced into a nutritious soup.`
	planet Geminus
		description `Geminus, although not the most hospitable of worlds, is a young enough planet that large stores of iron, titanium, and other metals are easily accessible near the surface. For that reason, it has become one of the Republic's primary shipyards. More than half of the warships in the Navy were constructed here.`
		description `		The constant volcanic activity leaves the planet perpetually shrouded in clouds of ash and fog, so that being outside means being in a twilight haze with low visibility. Probably in compensation for this, interior spaces tend to be brightly lit and painted in bold colors.`
	planet Gemstone
		description `Gemstone is a hot and unpleasant world, mostly due to a smoggy atmosphere high in methane. Much of the surface is covered in rugged mountains, making ground transport very difficult. However, the powerful tectonic forces here have created rich deposits of diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, which are mined for use in jewelry and certain electronic components.`
		description `		Mining a tectonically active world is an insane project. Earthquakes cause frequent cave-ins, but the potential for riches draws miners here despite high mortality rates. Most miners are dirt poor as a result of being paid on commission for their finds, but they are full of stories of some distant acquaintance who became mind-bogglingly wealthy after striking a previously untapped gemstone deposit.`
	planet "Gentle Rain"
		description `The rainforests on Gentle Rain are home to spiders so large that their webs are strung from one tree to another, and their typical prey is birds rather than insects. Another, equally large species of spider is able to leap four or five meters into the air in order to snatch a bird out of a passing flock. The rainforest trees grow so thick that except for occasional clearings, very little light actually filters through the leaves and reaches the ground, and during the rainy season the dirt is transformed into pools of stagnant mud.`
	planet Gestli
		description `Despite its smooth appearance from orbit, the surface of Gestli is a fractured mess of jagged mountains and rough hills. The tectonic activity of its moon, large enough to qualify as a binary pair, causes an almost perpetual global earthquake that can be felt by simply standing on the planet.`
		description `		The planet's parent stars offer the planet little warmth, and a thin atmosphere of nitrogen and carbon dioxide has managed to hold on to only scattered swathes of ice and snow, with far too little water or heat to support an active hydrological cycle. The anemic erosion, as a result, has done little to smooth the scars left by the influence of the tidal forces that wrack Gestli's surface.`
	planet Geyser
		description `Terraforming can change many things, but it cannot fix low gravity. Geyser was settled in the very first wave of space colonization, before refueling depots were available anywhere but Earth itself, so the only systems that could maintain trade with Earth were those that were only a few jumps away. Today, most of the industry centers around oil drilling and manufacturing, and the remaining workers are those who are too poor to leave.`
		description `		In recent years, Geyser's economy has not been able to support repairs to the centuries-old terraforming equipment, and as a result the climate has become increasingly arid, and it is difficult to grow food crops here.`
	planet Ghneoe
		description `Ghneoe's orbital period is dominated by a very long dry season due to the binary stars at the system's center. However, during a short portion of the year, Ghneoe experiences an intense water cycle that results in a boom of greenery and wildlife activity, developing a short-lived but flourishing ecosystem. Much of the flora and fauna have adapted to such drastic shifts in climate, and return to a dormant state once the intense heat cycle returns.`
		description `		Unlike its moon, Ghneoe has yet to see any sort of colonization efforts by the nearby Gegno Scin, perhaps due to the abnormal weather cycles, system warfare, or a combination of both.`
	planet "Giaru Gegno"
		description `The quality of its structure suggests that this Quarg ringworld has to have been completed rather recently, but there are some notable differences that don't seem Quarg-like. Some of the hangars and docks on the ring are oddly larger than others, and the inner quarters are wider and taller than what is normal for a Quarg. The hangar you currently are parked in, however, seems to be devoid of these characteristics, and is similar to ones in the Quarg ringworld in human space.`
		description `		Despite seeing numerous non-Quarg ships before landing on the ring, you are only guided around parts of the ring where they are not present.`
	planet Giiq-Oj-Sol
		description `The specific atmosphere of this planet combined with its volcanic activity have combined to make the perfect conditions for the geological production of strands of natural glass, which are thrown into the atmosphere by volcanoes and then carried by high winds all over the planet. This makes stepping outside of one's ship without some sort of protection a very bad idea, as the ground is littered with sharp fragments and the air is filled with microscopic glass particles, both capable of rapidly destroying living tissue.`
	planet Giiq-Sou-Kella
		description `Small, atmospherically placid, and tectonically stable, this planet is completely covered in a global ocean composed of liquid methane. A few small rock outcrops emerge above the offgassing waves, but there are no dry landmasses larger than a square kilometer or so.`
		description `Small, atmospherically placid, and tectonically stable, this planet is completely covered in a global ocean composed of liquid methane. The inherent toxicity of this environmental feature, combined with the frigid temperatures on its surface and the tiny amount of dry land, have made it unsuitable for long-term habitation.`
	planet Giverstone
		description `On this mining world, the Hai are using boring machines to drill tunnels straight into the hearts of the mountains. Each tunnel twists and turns to intersect the regions of rock with the highest concentrations of valuable ore. Most of the tunnels also join up with other tunnels that have been dug through the same mountains, so that there are multiple exits from any given point in the mines.`
	planet Glaze
		description `Glaze is a varied world with everything from sunny beaches to frozen tundra, but it is perhaps best known for its sandstone canyons and deserts. This world's wildlife has never been studied in great detail.`
		description `		Local rumors tell about an alien species of "canyon people" who live in caves in some of the deepest canyons, leading to a constant stream of visiting xenobiologists. The scientific consensus, however, is that these sightings have only been of a reclusive ape-like species that lives in the canyons, and is not known to dig caves or show any other sign of civilization.`
	planet Gliese
		description `A shine of magenta emanates from the depths of this planet, suggesting the presence of a strong heat source in the core of Gliese. While the color is pleasant at first, its brightness gets nauseating over time. The winds are calm and no storms are in sight, and if you look closely you can see creatures that look like very small jellyfish emitting a soft glow.`
	planet "Glittering Ice"
		description `The climate on Glittering Ice is so cold for most of the year that the creatures here have evolved thick layers of feathers, fur, or fat to keep themselves warm. As a result nearly all of them, from the smallest rodents to the largest predators, are practically spherical, appearing as shapeless blobs; for many of them it is hard for a casual observer to even figure out which side of them is their head.`
		description `		Colonies of one particularly clever species of large rodents that live near the equator are capable of using ice and snow to build interconnected, multi-layered warrens.`
	planet Glory
		description `Elsewhere in the galaxy, people speak dismissively of the "boughten sunshine" that rich terraformed worlds can afford. On Glory, even many of the lakes and hills are artificial, crafted to garden-like perfection.`
		description `		Fittingly, the chief industry on Glory is plastic surgery, along with other medical efforts aimed at prolonging life, funded by rich, elderly folks who have settled here.`
		description `		Glory is also home to the Academy of Planetary Sciences, the organization at the forefront of terraforming research. The Academy takes on only a handful of apprentices each year, and guards its secrets very closely.`
	planet Goldcrawl
		description `A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. There is a reception area just beyond the docking bay with an extremely long desk and a receptionist who informs you that this is a respite home for the elderly, and unless you have family here, you will not be permitted to wander the station. There are different service functions at various kiosks along the desk, as well as a small sales counter with handicrafts made by the residents.`
		description `The spaceport is virtually non-existent. A trio of vending machines occupy the entranceway from the dedicated loading area for the facility's regular deliveries. The entire place has a somewhat tacky vibe to it, and its ventilation system doesn't quite cover up the antiseptic hospital smell familiar to anyone who has visited terrestrial aged care facilities.`
	planet Graede
		description `Unlike the homeworld of the Gegno, the capital of the Vi is covered in astounding natural beauty where the land is untouched. Vast tracts of forests spread across relatively low mountain ranges, and a variety of both small and large marsupials can be seen running to and fro. Despite all of this, there are many plowed fields that have been converted to industrial ranges and shipyards, and several large cities have begun to grow towards the sky.`
	planet Grakhord
		description `Although human beings who do not mind living in low gravity are welcome to settle here, Grakhord is part of Quarg territory, and has been terraformed to meet their environmental needs rather than those of human beings. The full extent of the Quarg mining operations here are not known, but rumors say that they have tunnels reaching down almost halfway to the moon's core, and Quarg ships can also sometimes be seen harvesting hydrogen gas from the upper atmosphere of the gas giant that Grakhord orbits.`
	planet "Graveyard Wormhole (Unstable)"
	planet Greenbloom
		description `The islands and continents on this planet are almost entirely covered in marshes, rainforests, and (near the poles) dense coniferous forests, and the oceans appear green from above due to thick algae blooms and floating kelp mats. The overabundance of flora is caused by Greenbloom's major volcanoes, which constantly spew carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.`
	planet Greenrock
		description `Greenrock is the closest thing that the pirates in southern human space have to a center of government, but taking the form of large, powerful corporations rather than elected officials. When rival pirate bands seek to negotiate on neutral territory, this is where they meet. Nearly everything is for sale here: illegal weapons, ships customized for pirating, and even slaves.`
	planet Greenview
		description `Although not strictly humid by the standards of a planet, the air here has a rich, moist, and faintly verdant quality atypical of a space station. The station is run by the Hei Low Io species preservation foundation, and each of its four branches features a different internal climate showcasing life from distant worlds. An infographic proclaims it to be the largest collection in the galaxy of rare organisms sourced from private collections, rebuilt from genetic samples, or rescued before being exterminated after being deemed invasive on Hai worlds. It also mentions that certain exhibits have been improved in some cases with species recently acquired from human space through secret trade deals.`
		description `		The central spire is still largely residential, with some nursery and laboratory facilities.`
	planet Greenwater
		description `Greenwater is one of the few worlds in Hai space that is home to a sizable human population. The temperature on most of the planet's surface is too warm for the Hai, but tolerable for human beings. Close to the equator are scattered human settlements for farming or fishing, which trade with the Hai cities closer to the poles for technology and equipment.`
	planet "Gresku Fodar"
		description `Situated an ideal distance from this system's twin suns, this station holds greenhouses where the Korath grow a highly nutritious bacterial sludge that serves the exiles as their main food source. A few of the greenhouses are also growing more traditional crops, but these are clearly a luxury that the Korath cannot afford to waste more of their resources on.`
	planet Greymoon
		description `This station is owned and operated by the Far Loo Bah fuel collection corporation. Their logo is emblazoned on nearly every possible surface and sign, indicating their sponsorship of all manner of services and features on the station. Interestingly, this includes a "History of Spaceflight" museum which takes up an entire wing of the facility. Naturally, the museum focuses very heavily on the Far Loo Bah corporation's role in that history.`
	planet "Guardian Array Sapphire"
		description `More commonly referred to as "Checkpoint of Ablodab," this enormous station was built shortly after the end of the Coalition's war against the Quarg, meant to serve as a regional dry dock and supply base that damaged combat ships could return to after some time at the front lines. The lack of any subsequent counterattack, though, shifted its role to being a simple refueling hub for passing merchant ships, its dozens of warship-sized hangars remaining mostly unused.`
		description `		Despite the apparent lack of combat activity the station was designed to support, the local Heliarchs run a tight schedule even for civilian visitors as they land, ensuring ships are refueled and tended to as quickly as possible.`
	planet "Gue Faur"
		description `Like most Gegno Scin planets, Gue Faur is a steep jungle world bursting with many different forms of life. Surprisingly, a majority of the Scin's population resides on this planet rather than their capital. A great percentage of inhabitants consists of researchers and scientists, and all sorts of greenhouses and biodomes are visible everywhere.`
	planet Hai-home
		description `This is the home world of the Hai. Well over half the planet's surface is oceans. The land is mostly covered by sprawling cities, except for some mountain ranges too high or too snowy to build on. Despite its population of nearly eight billion, Hai-home is relatively free of pollution or overcrowding.`
	planet "Hammer of Debrugt"
		description `House Chamgar claims that their advances in aerospace and weapon technology were instrumental in driving the Quarg out of Coalition space about six millennia ago. Given how much more advanced the Saryds and Kimek were at the time, their claims are likely an exaggeration. But, there is no doubt that in the present day the home of House Chamgar has developed into an industrial world as productive as any in Coalition space, partly because this world is rich enough in natural resources that there is little need to import raw materials from elsewhere.`
	planet Harmony
		description `The first settlers who came to Harmony were an Amish community seeking a place where they could live a quiet life and do work with their own hands instead of relying on machines and computers. Their community grew to millions of people, who now live side by side with other, more modern settlers. There are still regions of the planet where motorized vehicles are prohibited, but in other places trucks and horse-drawn buggies share the same roads.`
	planet Haven
		description `Haven was founded by highly successful "privateers" nearly two centuries ago. Since then, as rival bands of pirates have fought over it, it has changed hands fourteen times, but has never been successfully invaded by the Republic. Numerous small manufacturing shops sell outfits that cannot be bought legally, and there is even a small shipyard where customized ships are sold to those who have the right connections.`
		description `		Much of the planet is desert, but with enough moisture to grow enough crops to feed the entire population. Strip mining has turned other parts of the planet into barren wastelands, and has polluted many of the rivers.`
	planet Haze
		description `Haze is a manufacturing world, covered in sprawling cities. It is a relatively prosperous planet, but so far the inhabitants have chosen to spend more of their terraforming budget on climate control than on pollution reduction.`
		description `		Very few regions of this planet remain untouched by human hands, but a few of the particularly mountainous or marshy areas have been set aside as nature preserves. More than half of the indigenous life forms have gone extinct since human settlement began here four centuries ago.`
	planet Heartland
		description `Heartland is a pleasant world, with a geography mostly consisting of low hills, plains, and oceans. The farms here produce bountiful crops, and as a result it has drawn tens of millions of settlers. Many of them now work in factories or assembly lines, in which most of the farm equipment used here and in the surrounding systems is built.`
		description `		Tractors from Heartland are trusted to be well-built and sturdy, and easy to repair; some are still in use that were built over a century ago.`
	planet Heartvalley
		description `An extreme amount of tectonic activity in its distant past has left Heartvalley with mountain ranges five to ten kilometers high in some places. Most of the Hai settlements here are in the valleys closer to sea level, where the air is dense enough for them to breathe comfortably. The tectonic activity has left many ancient sea-beds exposed, providing access to bountiful supplies of oil. To the Hai, oil is too precious a resource to be used for fuel; instead they process it into plastic and use the byproducts in other chemical processes.`
	planet Helheim
		description `Helheim is not a pleasant place. Much of the surface is volcanic, pockmarked with craters and steam vents leading deep into the planet's crust. The air is slightly caustic, but breathable.`
		description `		However, it is also a world rich in easily accessible deposits of nickel, aluminum, and magnesium. The mining industry here has been booming for centuries, and in all of the Deep it is the one world where work is never hard to find - if you are willing to face the health risks and the lack of green and growing things.`
	planet Hephaestus
		description `Hephaestus is home to Syndicated Systems, which manufactures parts used in shipyards throughout human space. Although not always the highest quality or most technologically advanced, ship outfits produced by the Syndicate are quite affordable and sufficient for any ordinary pilot's needs. The executives of many other companies have been known to make a pilgrimage of sorts to this planet, to witness firsthand how the Syndicate has made their production lines here so efficient and dependable.`
		description `		Nearly all the inhabitants of Hephaestus live in a single metropolitan area that has spread to cover almost an eighth of the total land mass. As with many Syndicate worlds, pollution is a growing problem that they are working hard to address.`
	planet Hermes
		description `No one is permitted to settle on Hermes without a government permit. It is a sparsely populated world, mostly used for medical research and development - including some research that, if the rumors are true, are carried out here in isolation so that if something goes wrong, entire districts can be quarantined or even "sterilized" by orbital bombardment.`
		description `		The landscape is nondescript, mostly rolling plains and forests. The oceans are relatively small, and as a result it is a somewhat dry planet.`
	planet Hespair
		description `Hespair was once a life-bearing world, but no longer. An unknown event several million years ago thoroughly sterilized the planet down to the last bacterium, and life has not since reemerged.`
		description `		However, during their exploration of the planet, the Avgi accidentally, if inevitably, introduced bacteria from their own ships to Hespair's oceans. These motes of life are still sparse, but even if the Avgi refrain from terraforming this world, they will form the seeds of a new biosphere at some point in the distant future.`
	planet Hestia
		description `In the distant past, Hestia was a nearly lifeless ice world. It is now a subtropical paradise, one of the great victories from the heyday of planetary engineering back when the galactic economy had more money to spare for terraforming.`
		description `		Today it is mostly a retirement community for those who can afford it, although most of the population consists of young service workers in rented housing who take care of the retirees.`
		description `		On Hestia, the poor live in cities; the rich live in country estates. Aside from the urban centers, most of this world is covered in rolling green hills and oceans.`
	planet Hilothire
		description `While Hilothire contains an oxygen-rich atmosphere, it is almost entirely covered in icy oceans. At the poles, massive ice caps stretch nearly to the tropics. Pristine icebergs often float down to the equator, where they accumulate around the few rocky islands that peek above the waves.`
		description `		A large research outpost was once set up on one of the larger islands to study the possibility of terraforming the world and warming its climate, but after the Incursion it has since gone uncrewed. The fueling station still contains a significant amount of stored fuel, however, which could be used by a passing ship to refuel.`
		description `The landing pads are thick slabs of frigid steel sunk deep into the island's gravely terrain. A thin layer of ice slicks the surface, making it hazardous to walk about, but you are able to find a working fuel pump half-buried in snow, powered by a small radioisotope power source.`
	planet Hippocrates
		description `Hippocrates is a sparsely settled world, home mostly to scientific research outposts.`
		description `		The environment here, orbiting so close to a red dwarf star, is very different from most other settled planets. The scientists estimate this star system to be over ten billion years old, enough that life here has had much more time to develop and evolve than on any planet orbiting a brighter, more short-lived star.`
	planet Hope
		description `In the year 2994, Hope was a somewhat cold but otherwise hospitable planet, home to a burgeoning population of almost two million people. But that year, a supervolcano eruption ejected so much dust into the upper atmosphere that a new ice age set in and the planet became unlivable.`
		description `		As the temperatures steadily dropped, nearly half the Republic Navy was mobilized to evacuate settlers from Hope and transport them to nearby colonies. The evacuation effort took six months.`
		description `		The abandoned villages and towns are now buried deep beneath the snow, and occasional treasure hunters come here to explore them and find items of value that were left behind.`
	planet Hopper
		description `Hopper is a temperate world of oceans, mountains, and plains, but with unfortunately high levels of sulfuric acid in its atmosphere. Metal and stone that are exposed to the atmosphere corrode quickly, requiring frequent maintenance. As a result, Hopper has only a few small settlements on it, and most of the industry is focused on underground mining.`
		description `		The oceans are populated only by a few indigenous life forms that have adapted to their high acidity; Earth fish could not be introduced successfully here.`
	planet "Huginn Station"
		description `Huginn and Muninn stations, together, are the gateway to the Deep, the region of space north of here. The Deep was the first large region of space to have a democratic government, predating the Republic by nearly two centuries.`
		description `		Huginn Station is a prison station where convicted pirates must work at harvesting and refining deuterium to atone for their crimes against humanity. There are no services available for you here and the security guards, surprised by your visit and wondering at your motives, watch you closely.`
	planet Humanika
		description `The gravity is too strong on this planet for the Quarg to inhabit it, so they have welcomed human settlers instead. Many people who want freedom from the dangers of human space and the endless instability of human government have settled here.`
		description `		Although the regions near the equator are far too warm to be comfortable, the climate closer to the poles is almost ideal; the only reason Humanika is not as densely populated as some of the worlds farther to the galactic north is the distrust with which most humans view the Quarg.`
	planet Humo
		description `Interestingly, this gas giant is not only made from gaseous elements; sand is being pushed around in the air and accumulates on the windows of your ship. A constant updraft from the center of the planet seems to be the reason for the presence of sand in the upper atmosphere. While the sand itself is not dangerous, it may pile up in your ship's mechanics if you stay here for too long.`
	planet "Hydra Station"
		description `This station is so run-down that most of the workers carry oxygen masks in case a meteoroid punctures the hull, and a few of them are even dressed in full space suits. The deuterium refinery here is barely operating, the number of workers is minimal, and nearly half of them seem to be busy just welding patches onto the hull to hold the station together. At the moment, there are no repair or refueling services available here.`
	planet Icefall
		description `Icefall is far from its sun, with an axial tilt of roughly 38 degrees. This means that the climate is cold, the year is also long, and each hemisphere has a short summer - barely enough to fit a terrestrial growing season. Nevertheless, most of the inhabitants are farmers, with the exception of the oil drilling industry at the equator. There are only a few major towns, and no major metropolitan centers. Icefall's oceans are filled with constantly shifting pack ice and icebergs, making them nearly unnavigable.`
		description `		The most distinctive feature of the local ecology is the vast flocks of gooselike migratory birds, which raise two broods a year: one in each hemisphere's summer. The farm workers migrate in similar fashion, and many landowners have farms in both hemispheres.`
	planet Icelake
		description `Icelake is the second most populous Hai planet. Since its oil and natural gas reserves have long since been depleted, the large cities and factories here rely heavily on geothermal and wind energy. One fortunate side effect of that is that the air here is almost as pristine as on a non-industrial world.`
	planet Iconil
		description `The first crewed interstellar expedition launched by the Avgi entered orbit first around Iconil, rather than the tantalizingly habitable world of Livolua nearby. This seemingly unorthodox decision was made by the ship's crew because of the dwarf planet's combination of low gravity and visible patches of sparkling ice, which offered an easy way to replenish the vessel's propellant. The mission spent several months gathering resources and launching probes before finally crossing the last stretch to settle Livolua: the Avgi's first interstellar colony.`
	planet Iddesato
		description `Iddesato is a considerably large station, at least when compared to a human one, but much of its size can be attributed to the large constructs sticking out of its front, the purpose of which you can only guess at. The rest of the station seems more normal, with a large hangar that acts as the station's spaceport.`
	planet "Iemn Eitch"
		description `Although too cold for a proper civilization, Iemn Eitch has been extensively used in the past as an outpost for the growing Gegno space race. As one of their first few explored worlds, antique-looking architecture is scattered about the surface and looks significantly different to structures found on Dueyu Eitch, perhaps due to the nature of construction in an unfamiliar environment. A few large shipyard-esque platforms continue to service a small number of still active Gegno generation vessels from times past, presumably at a much slower pace than during the earliest days of their space colonization.`
	planet Igna
		description `This gas giant has an extremely hot atmosphere due to its proximity to the system's star. The clouds emit a warm, orange glow, enabling good visibility even in deeper layers. Occasional storms break the almost peaceful atmosphere, raging violently but disappearing as quickly as they appeared.`
	planet "Illbo Avo"
		description `Illbo Avo is a barren moon with little to no atmosphere, but it is also the only solid ground in this system that isn't prone to sliding out under your feet as a result of volcanism. As such, because of the system's proximity to Paru Paru and to the Korath, the Bunrodea have turned the crust of this small moon into a dense network of subterranean structures with purposes ranging from large ship hangars to factories that pump out military-grade ships and outfits, essentially making it one big war factory.`
	planet "Illbo Elo"
		description `Illbo Elo is a sparsely populated world, with much of the planet's surface being barely habitable deserts. The climate becomes more temperate as you approach the poles, where most of the population is located. The Bunrodea appear to be constructing entirely new cities within these temperate zones, as evident by the large fleets of freighters bringing supplies to cities of mostly skeletal buildings with exposed foundations and metal beams.`
	planet Independance
		description `Independance, originally named for a document of emancipation for an ancient nation on old Earth, became of interest to the Confederated Councils when they began to consider plans for a defense against an invasion. One such plan involved deploying "cloud bunkers" into the gas giants of the Outer Rim from which an uprising could be staged against a foreign occupier. Independance, given its fitting name and position near Alvorada, was chosen as the testing site for this project.`
		description `		Of the few prototype bunkers that were deployed, none ever survived Independance's surface - the Councils simply didn't have the technology for such an ambitious project. The official who proposed the plan was shortly shuffled out of the Politburo, and what remained of the bunkers was quietly left to decay in the depths of the gas giant.`
	planet Ingot
		description `Ingot is a volcanic moon, totally unsuitable for life but rich in metal. The miners who work here must spend all their time inside pressurized buildings.`
		description `		Because Ingot has almost no atmosphere to slow them down, meteorites are a constant danger to the colonists. The shells of the buildings have multiple layers, designed to be self-sealing in any but the largest of impacts. Most of the mining is done remotely by robotic vehicles, but someone still needs to be present to control them and to make repairs when something goes wrong.`
	planet "Inmost Blue"
		description `Inmost Blue is an ocean world, one of the first planets that the Kimek settled outside their own solar system. About two billion Kimek live on the low-lying islands and the one major continent, and the shallow ocean regions have been entirely converted into kelp farms. The Kimek take a utilitarian approach to food, and processed seaweed is a nutritious but highly unappetizing staple of their diet.`
	planet "Into White"
		description `Formerly a fruitful farming world, this planet is now in the grips of an approaching ice age. The Kimek have chosen to wait it out rather than risking destabilizing the planet's ecosystems by trying to correct the temperature change, and the population has dwindled to less than a billion, mostly living near the equator where the climate is still somewhat temperate.`
	planet Iritoroost
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Despite Iritoroost's relative isolation from any inhabited planets, the station appears to be visited with remarkable frequency. It may have become something of a destination for those looking to do shady business, but the evidence left behind by visitors is eclectic. As virtually all but the most basic systems are inactive, it seems the lack of continuous surveillance has proven attractive to those looking for an extra measure of privacy, for whatever reasons they may have.`
	planet Ironfirth
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Judging by the size of the docking bay in this station, there appears to have been a substantial level of intra-system traffic between Ironfirth and Makerplace. The station's former population most likely commuted to the planet for work, filling up its factories and ballooning their output. Considering how busy it must have been in its prime, the docking bay is eerily quiet.`
	planet Iyra-Ijasa-Iret
		description `As far as you can tell, Iyra-Ijasa-Iret is a purely water world, with no solid land anywhere upon its surface. Despite this, it has several underwater settlements and cities. Most dot the shallows, but you notice that several pressure-resistant ships dive much deeper into the ocean, suggesting that some inhabitants may live at more significant depths.`
		description `Iyra-Ijasa-Iret is a pure water world, with no solid land anywhere upon its surface. Despite this, it hosts a relatively sizable population of Successors, most living in several sprawling underwater cities that dot the shallows, but some in much deeper and more pressure-resistant enclaves closer to the ocean floor. The moon is revered throughout Successor space for its undersea beauty; on the side of the moon that faces the gas giant which it orbits, huge plumes of bioluminescent plankton stream up towards the surface from the deep ocean in a daily feeding cycle the Successors call the "Ribbons of Iret."`
	planet Jakobsen
		description `Jakobsen is an ocean world with only 6% of its surface above sea level. The land consists almost exclusively of volcanic islands and atolls, as any land not refreshed by plate tectonics is slowly being eroded away by the immense seasonal storms that wreathe the planet.`
		description `		Despite these conditions, Jakobsen is an agricultural world, with vast fields of algae cultivated both to sustain the atmosphere's oxygen content and to provide a nutritious, if bland, staple food.`
	planet Janalos
		description `From orbit, Janalos is a lush, forested world with a thriving ecosystem, ripe for colonization. It is only from the surface that it becomes apparent that this thriving ecosystem is in fact dominated by a mind-boggling variety of insects, large and small. The bugs are everywhere, permeating every part of the planet, and recent colonization efforts were thrwarted by just how inconvenient they make life on this world. Insecticides are quickly adapted to, eggs and larvae can lie dormant for years before re-emerging, and the swarms of insects devour anything they can sink their chitinous teeth into.`
		description `		Even an unsanctioned atomic sterilization of a small valley, in a desperate attempt to clear a foothold for settlers, proved ineffective after only a few short months.`
	planet Janiculum
		description `As you pass low over Janiculum, you see that its surface is little more than a gravitational graveyard for asteroids and debris. Impact craters litter the surface, with some looking fairly recent.`
		description `		Janiculum is the subject of regular surveillance by the Remnant, who track impacts and investigate them whenever they occur. While it is not clear what the Remnant are recovering from these investigations, they continue to do them with meticulous regularity.`
	planet Jentuthro
		description `Jentuthro orbits one of the dimmest stars in this region of space, making it an unusual place to find the Bunrodea. It is also where you will find their major genetic engineering research facilities. These facilities attract the brightest minds in genetic engineering from across all of Bunrodean space, where they work to further their understanding and control over genetics.`
		description `		Although the majority of genetic research is done here, much of its practice is done on the world of Melenci in the region north of Paru Paru.`
	planet Jupiter
		description `Once called the King of the Solar System, Jupiter is just as impressive even considering the variety of gas giants in the galaxy. Its famous Great Red Spot is still well-known by most of humanity, and you make sure to steer clear of it while taking in the rich yellows and browns of the planet's atmosphere.`
		description `		From your vantage point, deep below the furthest excursions of human probes, you can see the glint of a few sensor balloons and floating deuterium collectors high above you.`
	planet Kaeyin
		description `The world of Kaeyin now seems to be completely uninhabited, but it hasn't always been like that. Large, empty cities with towers of indescribable design encompass a portion of one single continent. The rest of the land remains almost untouched by anything not native to this planet, as if the buildings were simply lowered down onto the land rather than built up over time.`
		description `The only word you can think of to describe the spaceport is "impressive." It is on the top of the largest tower, placed in the exact center of a gargantuan city. With a base almost as big as a sizable village, very quickly getting thinner as it raises into the city's skyline.`
		description `		Tiny, four-legged robots walk on the walls of every room, cleaning them in a matter of seconds. You can see more on the road below, and you presume they are everywhere in this city; this makes it impossible to estimate how long the planet has been abandoned, since everything here is perfect and clean.`
	planet Kalakil
		description `The view from the surface of this pristine forest moon is nothing short of breathtaking, in equal parts from its natural beauty and the chill of its misty air. Cold glacier streams flow from a chain of tall, jagged mountains that round the entire moon, running through sunset-colored forests that meet the sun each morning tinged with frost.`
		description `		Aside from scientific expeditions that have left campsites scattered across the moon, Kalakil is untouched, a wilderness on the edge of what the Avgi managed to explore before the Incursion.`
	planet Kalbai
		description `For some reason, this apparently fruitful world has been left largely unsettled by the Bunrodea. Kalbai is teeming with life of all kinds, from varieties of plants across the various forests and plains of the planet's surface to the critters of varying sizes that scurry through the underbrush.`
		description `		There are only minimal signs that anyone has ever set foot on this world; there are a number of ancient ruins scattered across the largest continent. A few appear to have been abandoned and reclaimed by nature, but most look as though they were destroyed, creating strikingly lifeless circles in the landscape around the center of the ruins.`
	planet Kapnos
		description `Kapnos is the heart of one of the most spectacular sights in the Milky Way. The gas giant is composed of largely molecular oxygen, despite the seeming impossibility of such an occurrence in nature. Its abnormally rapid spin, which causes the planet to bulge wildly at the equator, throws oxygen and water vapor off the top of its atmosphere to form the famous Gossamer "gas torus," something that has sparked awe in the entire Avgi civilization from the moment of its discovery.`
		description `		The fact that there is more gas in the torus than one gas giant can account for has not been unnoticed, however, and many among the Avgi believe the entire system to be an artificial construct engineered by the long dead Antecessors.`
	planet "Karek Fornati"
		description `Karek Fornati was once a farming world, before global temperatures began to rise and the overworked farmland slowly deteriorated into deserts. The Korath who remain have dedicated their lives to finding a way to keep the "sand seas" from swallowing up the last of the fertile land, but without much success, and there are regions near the equator where sandstorms rage continually and no living things can survive.`
	planet Kasi-Osolaa-Sossa
		description `By far the most isolated and remote planet in Successor space, Kasi-Osolaa-Sossa is populated mainly by those who enjoy the peace and quiet that comes with solitude. For the highly familial Successors, this is a relatively small proportion, and consequently the planet only supports around twenty thousand inhabitants, though it has the highest population growth of any planet in Successor space. Most agree that this is a result of disinterest in the sometimes-painful political division of the larger Successor worlds, but it is commonly joked that it is instead a consequence of supposed especially amorous tendencies among the local population.`
	planet "Kasichara Fet"
		description `This planet appears to have suffered irradiation when the neighboring star of Peresedersi went nova. The local flora and fauna are alive but still struggling to recover from the loss. Several large Korath cities remain. It seems that they were not able, or not willing, to evacuate the entire population in time to escape the nova's gamma radiation; sun-bleached bones are scattered in the streets of the largest cities.`
	planet Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa
		description `Although inhospitable by human standards, the snow-covered Kasii-Cavasaa-Oa falls comfortably within the Successors' tolerances, if on the low end of that range. Beneath the permafrost lie rich deposits of rare earth elements and heavy metals that have supported the highly self-contained economy of House Aqrabe; entire production lines from raw material to final product are contained upon this single planet. Since many of the minerals mined here are integral for the production of the Successors' advanced composite materials, Aqrabe and the other New Houses keep a tight grip here, funneling many of the end products into their shipyards and construction projects.`
	planet Kasii-Tuur-Saqru
		description `While some of the High Houses of the Predecessors managed to immigrate to this star cluster in their political entirety, others collapsed along the way. Some of their former citizens were folded into House Kaatriij, but the rest, the majority, were to temporarily habitate here. Now, many years later, their descendants largely still do.`
		description `		The station, by now crowded and in disrepair, is technically the property of the Old Houses, but is far outside their jurisdiction, leaving it de facto stateless like its inhabitants. Without a claim to any other citizenship, those inhabitants have formed the so-called "People's Houses," semi-familial groups that they laud as effective democratic governments but which are denigrated by most in the High Houses as little more than gangs of populist outlaws shielded by stale treaties.`
	planet Katkradol
		description `Katkradol is a large rocky world, what human scientists would call a "super-Earth." Far from the local primary, Katkradol is extremely cold; during the winter its atmosphere condenses in the higher latitudes, where it snows frozen nitrogen. Many of Katkradol's mountains are made mostly of ice, which is strong enough in the extreme cold to stretch upwards for kilometers, even under the high gravity. The roots of these mountains generated some interest in the Avgi scientific community due to the many exotic phases of ice that form under the intense pressures, but Katkradol's deep gravity well made ice mining uncompetitive with comet harvesting in the region.`
	planet Kella-Uuoru-Sossa
		description `This planet is an ecological catastrophe. Its surface has been scoured by radiation and by what must have been an orbital bombardment; no organic life remains. Many large cities dot the surface, several of which have been leveled or damaged by weapon strikes, and far more which are nearly entirely intact. All are equally empty. Persistent clouds of caustic dust choke the atmosphere, and your ship's sensors alert you to the presence of several dust storms at other locations on the planet's surface. It would be wise not to get caught in one.`
		description `This is the ancestral homeworld of the Successor species. The spatial anomalies that now dominate this system have scoured its surface with radiation and evaporated most of its once-extensive oceans. The great cities of the Predecessors' empire are now devoid of all organic life; many of them remain as pristine and gleaming as on the days they were abandoned. Caustic dust chokes the lower atmosphere of the planet, and your ship's sensors alert you to the presence of several sandstorms at other locations on the planet's surface. It would be wise not to get caught in one.`
		description `A massive spaceport on the surface stands proudly even after thousands of years of disuse. Grand walls and cavernous vaulted ceilings rise hundreds of meters up above your ship, some scarred by weapons fire, others distorted by heat or radiation. A couple of small cleaning drones attempt to polish the weather-worn floors, while others wander aimlessly, devoid of purpose and direction.`
		description `The planet's main spaceport endures proudly even after thousands of years of disuse. Grand walls and cavernous vaulted ceilings rise hundreds of meters above your ship, some scarred by weapons fire, others distorted by heat or radiation. One flock of small cleaning drones continually polishes the sand-worn floors, while others wander about aimlessly, devoid of purpose or direction.`
	planet "Keneska Fek"
		description `The Kor Sestor apparently use this as a mining world, but rather than digging for minerals they have been intentionally crashing metal-rich asteroids into undeveloped sections of the desert where the robots can then break them apart and extract the ore. Predictably, the ecological effects of this sort of mining are devastating.`
	planet "Kessel Sepret"
		description `In this factory station, raw metal harvested in the other Korath systems is shaped into ships and weapons, the war materiel for their raids on human space. Sections of the ships are assembled and tested in pressurized hangars, but the Palavret is a large enough ship that the final assembly must be done in space, outside the station.`
	planet Khora-Uurau-Uuoru
		description `This moon appears to have been used as an ancient weapons testing site. The scars of violence still mar its surface, and its tenuous atmosphere clings desperately to its surface, almost as if it is still terrified of being stripped away.`
		description `Thousands of years ago, during the reign of the Predecessors' empire, this moon was used as a weapons testing site. Since the Successors have not invented any novel weapons requiring an entire moon to test since the collapse of the old empire, Khora-Uurau-Uuoru has remained unbombarded since then. Even so, the scars of ancient violence still mar its surface, and its tenuous atmosphere clings desperately to its surface, almost as if it is still terrified of being stripped away.`
	planet Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa
		description `Much of Successor technology relies on advanced composite materials, from their extremely durable ship hulls to their high-performance kinetic weapons. This planet contains rich natural deposits of the raw materials required for the manufacturing of their composites, and consequently, it serves as both a center for the mining of these materials and as the industrial core of Successor space.`
		description `		Because Khora-Vasa-Reyyaa falls within the sphere of influence of the Old Houses, many in the New Houses are very concerned about the power imbalance this creates, and several treaties are in place ensuring fair and open exports from the planet.`
	planet Khosa-Kella-Oa
		description `Devoid of atmosphere, this small and rocky world sits at the very edge of the galaxy. This may very well be the last planet for millions of light years, the furthest child of the Milky Way.`
		description `Devoid of atmosphere, this small and rocky world sits at the western end of Successor space, orbiting a dim star. Because of the Successors' location on the rim of the galaxy, this may very well be the last planet for millions of light years, the furthest child of the Milky Way.`
	planet "Ki Patek Ka"
		description `This is the Kimek home world. Before they developed spaceflight, billions of Kimek died either from famine or from civil wars brought on by overpopulation. Today, every major city still has "hunger towers": kilometer-high skyscrapers where yeast and bacterial cultures are grown in massive vats in order to provide a bland but stable source of emergency rations if the crops and the food shipments from off-world should ever fail.`
	planet Kisarra
		description `Kisarra's surface is one vast desert as far as the eye can see. The sandy nothingness is only occasionally broken up by oases and rocky outcrops. Many of the oases have small towns that have formed around them and some of the outcrops seem to used as entrances to mines. Strikingly, all of the towns and mines have large walls constructed around them.`
	planet "Korati Efreti"
		description `This small Korath station is positioned at the Lagrangian point in between this system's sun and the planet that the Quarg had been mining for material to build the ringworld. The station is dwarfed by the ringworld, but nonetheless manages to make a statement: re-asserting the territorial rights of the Korath in the face of an alien species that chose to build a settlement in one of their systems.`
	planet "Korbatri Eska"
		description `The cities on this world have been hit by an astonishing variety of weapons. Some were leveled by massive explosions, while others show signs of strafing by low-flying ships or of orbital bombardment. Outside the cities, the land is fruitful and varied: forests, mountains, oceans, desert, and tundra.`
	planet "Kort Kehai"
		description `This planet has a temperate climate, yet its surface is nearly lifeless, perhaps due in part to the high concentration of radioactive isotopes in the soil. The only plant growing on most of the land is a hardy bioengineered moss designed by the Wanderers to accumulate heavy metals and other toxins in its root system. These plants are then periodically harvested by flocks of unpiloted robots and buried in deep pits near the planet's poles.`
	planet "Kort Vek'kri"
		description `This world is nearly unpopulated, with very little animal life and strange, twisted plants with odd coloration. In small patches of land, the native vegetation gives way to green forests and fields, which were probably planted there by the Wanderers. In some of the larger forests, birds and insects have begun to flourish.`
	planet "Kraken Station"
		description `Kraken Station is seven centuries old; it was the first space station built outside of the Sol system. The station has been modified and repaired so often since that time that in all likelihood not a single deck panel or bulkhead that was part of the original station remains.`
		description `		Four centuries ago it was nearly destroyed by an asteroid impact, but other than that it has been a working deuterium refinery for its entire lifetime.`
	planet Kua-Oa-Aava
		description `This small moon hosts only a few surface installations; most are much larger than the public spaceport and are frequented exclusively by military craft. Beyond these, the moon is barren and undeveloped and your ship's sensors detect nothing of interest beyond the spaceport limits.`
		description `The Old Houses have established several refueling and restock facilities on Aava-Aasa-Khora's moon to increase the speed at which they can service their warships by taking advantage of the additional space and low gravity the moon provides. While nominally open to the public, the vast majority of the facilities here are devoted entirely to military use, and the civilian areas are mostly intended to make sure that no ships without clearance will become stranded in this system.`
	planet Kuj-Sol-Nnesa
		description `This hot and arid world hosts giant millipede-like creatures that roam the sand during the twilight hours, hunting anything that moves.`
		description `This desert planet is far too hot and arid for the Successors' environmental needs, and its lack of any meaningful deposits of natural resources has precluded its exploitation by mining or industry. It is occasionally visited by Successor researchers, primarily to study the local fauna; giant millipede-like creatures are known to roam the sand here during the twilight hours, hunting anything that moves.`
	planet Kumkapi
		description `While this moon's minerals aren't particularly rare or exotic, its closeness to Viminal has made it the subject of many mining projects over the centuries - efforts to find traces of the valuable Key Stones which permit travel through this region of space. None of them were successful, and most Remnant scientists believe that Kumkapi formed somewhere else and was captured by Vimnal's gravitational pull at some time during its formation.`
		description `		When the absence of Key Stones became clear, most scientific and mining interests faded away, and today the surface is scattered with abandoned outposts whose somber tunnels are thousand-kilometer labyrinths.`
	planet "Kuwaru Efreti"
		description `This Quarg ringworld is almost half completed, but there are no signs of active construction, and your ship's sensors picked up no energy signals from any section of the ring except for this one. You also observed superficial weapon scars on some parts of the ring, damage that the Quarg have not bothered to repair - although clearly the attackers did not possess weapons powerful enough to do any serious harm to the ring.`
	planet Lagrange
		description `The Quarg built this station centuries ago, before they began construction on the ringworld. From the dark side of the station, the ring is visible as a thin bright filament stretching out to either side of the system's sun. The ring itself is closed to human visitors, but tour shuttles depart from here on a regular basis, giving human tourists a closer view of this engineering feat that is so far beyond anything human beings have ever attempted to build.`
	planet "Laki Nemparu"
		description `This is an old factory world, so shrouded in smog that only tiny glimpses of the land are visible from above. Deep under the oceans of Laki Nemparu are oil reservoirs so vast that centuries of industry have not yet drained them dry. All but the hardiest of the native vegetation and wildlife is now long extinct from lack of direct sunlight or from pollution and chemical exposure.`
	planet "Lenz's Loop"
		description `Lenz's Loop takes its name from the powerful magnetic field produced by its metallic hydrogen core. As one of the most powerful natural sources of magnetism known to humanity, it is named for Emil Lenz and his discoveries about the interactions between magnetism and electric currents.`
		description `		While your ship's shielding fortunately keeps it safe from the dangerously strong magnetic field, captured charged particles from Kochab's frequent flares are channeled into the atmosphere near the poles, where it would be exceedingly dangerous for you to venture.`
	planet Letis'sei
		description `Letis'sei is an ancient station with cramped interiors and massive inaccessible sections. Completely unpressurized and lacking an internal atmosphere, it is hard to imagine what this station originally looked like. Nonetheless, three impressive cannon-like structures are still recognizable, floating outside the rest of the station. The ring that used to keep them together is destroyed, but they continue rotating around the main body in the circular formation that they were made to follow.`
	planet "Leviathan Station"
		description `Leviathan Station is the Deep's most productive deuterium harvesting station. Built nearly four hundred years ago, the station was one of the first to fuel the massive cargo caravans sent out from the Deep back when this was one of the only regions of the galaxy with a prosperous economy and a democratic government. Today it remains under government control, because the citizens of the Deep are wary of any private corporation controlling the industry that makes interstellar travel possible.`
	planet Lichen
		description `Lichen is a rainy world of marshes, fields, and streams. More than half the rice consumed in this administrative district is grown on Lichen, because of its near-optimal climate. However, because of the constant rain and overcast weather, few people aside from farmers have settled here.`
		description `		Planetary government, or indeed any government above the village level, is virtually nonexistent. Most farms are small and family-owned, negotiating sales directly with off-world corporations who then arrange for transportation of the produce.`
	planet Limejog
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Though it had long since been abandoned by the time the raids began, this station came under repeated attack during the Hai-Korath war and still bears the marks to this day. Even so, the station is remarkably intact, a testament to the durability and longevity, if not necessarily the beauty, of Hai engineering.`
	planet Livolua
		description `Livolua was the first extrasolar planet to be colonized by the Avgi, through the use of multiple waves of slower than light starships over two hundred years ago. With its wide range of climates ideal for life, it boasts a population two thirds as large as Aviskir itself, and an equally impressive number of independent polities.`
		description `		While perhaps not as wealthy or comfortable as Aviskir itself, Livolua is full of younger, ambitious polities with their eyes set on growth, a dynamic that has produced a vibrant independent civilization capable of rivaling the homeworld.`
	planet Lodestone
		description `Lodestone is a young, volcanically active world. The atmosphere is often filled with choking dust or sulfur dioxide, and new eruptions can occur with hardly any warning. Building any sort of structure here is an exercise in futility.`
		description `		The only reason Lodestone is inhabited is because of the planet's unusually rich reserves of heavy metals and other rare minerals.`
	planet Longjump
		description `Longjump is a mostly industrial world, with lower than normal gravity that makes it relatively easy to operate and transport heavy equipment. Hang-gliding is also a popular sport here, although for safety reasons it is prohibited anywhere near the spaceport.`
		description `		Longjump was the first planet discovered in the region of space known today as the Rim. Every year in the month of August, the Rim celebrates Han Sizer month, a whole month of activities commemorating the first explorer of the region. Wealthier citizens of the Rim celebrate by visiting as many Rim worlds as they can in the month, paralleling Han Sizer's month-long exploration of the region.`
	planet Luna
		description `In the early days of space travel, back when engines were still so inefficient that escaping from a planet's gravity was costly and difficult, an enormous shipyard was built on the Moon where asteroids, harvested from the asteroid belt, were mined for raw materials for ships.`
		description `		The facility is still in operation, although it is now overshadowed by the far more advanced shipbuilding centers like Geminus in the Castor system.`
	planet Mabatham
		description `Mabatham teeters on the line between ocean planet and hothouse world. With a surface largely covered with water, broken only by a handful of volcanic islands, its atmosphere is thick and humid, saturated with water vapor that works to trap the heat from its two parent stars. While temperate near the poles, the equator is inhospitably warm, with constant hurricanes dwarfing anything seen on either Earth or Aviskir raging in the tropics.`
		description `		Despite the constant rains and frequent storms, the planet's bountiful oceanic ecosystem is able to sustain a small community of particularly stubborn Avgi, who managed to eke out a life on a rocky island chain. They refused to be evacuated in the wake of the Incursion, and their outpost remains, weathering the wind and sea.`
		description `The 'spaceport' is nothing more than a stony island mostly cleared of boulders and debris, where spaceplanes could take off and land. A few small cranes and fuel tanks are strewn haphazardly along the edge, used to service the rare visitor, but there are otherwise no permanent structures.`
	planet Maelstrom
		description `Maelstrom is a stormy, geologically young world with towering mountains and frequent earthquakes. Most of the large cities are near the center of the planet's main continent, where the iron beds from an ancient ocean are exposed. Maelstrom is one of the chief exporters of iron, copper, gold, titanium, and other metals to Ada, where Lovelace Labs and the associated industries have a continuous need for raw materials.`
		description `		Extreme rock climbing is a hugely popular sport among the mining workers here, who have a tendency to be young, male, and reckless. The mountains are dramatic enough to even attract off-world climbers as tourists, though more than once a favorite climbing face has been sloughed off its mountain in an earthquake.`
	planet Mahoganybox
		description `A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. Leaving the docking bay brings you into a tastefully decorated room with a donut-shaped reception desk made of an exotic material that you can't immediately identify. A smiling Hai in a suit behind the desk informs you that this is a respite home for the elderly, and unless you have family here, you will not be permitted to wander beyond this room. You are, however, welcome to visit with anyone who has come down or ask an orderly if you need to contact someone on business.`
		description `The spaceport here is scarcely worthy of the name and does not facilitate trading, but is well equipped to handle regular traffic bringing people to and from the station. This place appears to service the fit but retiring demographic, whose minds are as sharp as ever but benefit from fewer demanding pressures on their physical bodies.`
	planet Mainsail
		description `Mainsail is a water world: although there are some settlements on dry land, the largest cities are floating, artificial islands, which travel between hemispheres over the course of the year pursuing the most ideal weather. Other, smaller islands are privately owned by single families or corporations. Mainsail is a prohibitively expensive place to live.`
		description `		Centuries ago Mainsail was home to pirates of the old-fashioned variety, fleets of motor boats or even old-fashioned sailing vessels that would launch raids against the city-ships.`
	planet Maker
		description `When families or young adults on Earth find themselves stifled by the crowded conditions on humanity's home world, Maker is where many of them end up. The Syndicate offers free transportation and housing in exchange for anyone willing to sign a five years contract to the mines or factories on Maker. The living conditions are often unpleasant, with young men and women packed into dormitories, and with those who are most in need of income taking dangerous jobs in the mines. Five or ten years of work will earn you enough to set up a homestead on any of the frontier worlds, and to many, those years are worth it.`
	planet Makerplace
		description `Makerplace has an unusual degree of volcanic activity due to high concentrations of radioactive elements in the planet's mantle. Although it is warm by Hai standards, the abundance of geothermal energy, combined with plentiful solar energy and wind power, has made it an ideal world for manufacturing. Several cities in the temperate regions have populations of over a hundred million Hai, and the factories surrounding the cities spread out for dozens of kilometers in all directions. Near the equator, much of the land is desert or volcanic wasteland.`
	planet Mani
		description `Mani is a small moon, with an atmosphere thick enough to keep your blood from boiling off but too thin to breathe without assistance. It is used only as a cargo depot and a spot for refueling and repairs.`
		description `		The native plant life mostly consists of pale-colored lichens and a few species of grass. The only animals are insects.`
	planet "Market of Gupta"
		description `This mountain world is the home base of House Mallob, the powerful Arach guild in charge of commerce and shipping. All the Arach starships that are currently in use were designed here, and many of them are manufactured here as well. The motto of House Mallob's shipyards is "strong as the mountains, spacious as the skies," referring to their focus on durable hulls and high cargo capacity.`
	planet Mars
		description `Mars was humanity's first attempt at terraforming. Although it remains a dry, cold desert, the air is now breathable without an oxygen tank, and there are sections of the planet where a fair number of plants can grow.`
		description `		Because far more hospitable planets are available to those with enough money to pay for interstellar travel, the farms and ranches of Mars are run mostly by poorer Earth families who want to escape the pollution and congestion, along with some young adults who do farm work to help finance their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to stand on another world.`
	planet Martini
		description `Martini is a world of exotic beaches and perfect weather. The Republic's central bank and the Galactic Stock Exchange are headquartered here, and so much money flows through this world's economy every day that the cost of utterly controlling its weather and climate is only a drop in the bucket. Not surprisingly, real estate prices here are astronomical; a small condo in one of Martini's main cities costs more than a capital starship.`
	planet Masada
		description `Masada is an old world, one that was dying long before humanity was born. Its tectonic activity ended long ago, and the eons of erosion has worn its terrain down to the bedrock. Most of the surface is bone dry, with the only water trapped in a small chain of cold, brackish seas near the equator. Little rain falls outside their drainage basins, but what does is bitter and alkaline. The broken remains of what might have once been cities, worn down to little more than circular arrangements of rubble, hints that there is much history here - but no future.`
		description `		In orbit, the Avgi left behind a constellation of satellites to map the surface, but little else. The lack of anything left by the planet's original inhabitants is a reminder of just how old this world is - old enough for even the highest orbits to decay.`
	planet Maspa-Viir-Kella
		description `This planet is about as large as a terrestrial planet can be before it is considered a gas giant. It is surrounded by an extremely thick atmosphere that is just barely within the tolerances of traditional shipbuilding techniques, which buffets your vessel with high winds before you even make landing. It is hard to see anything at any distance on the ground; the fog is simply too thick.`
	planet Mavra-Sol-Kvel
		description `This green and well-populated moon enjoys a temperate climate and spectacular vistas, both of its own surface and of the gas giant it orbits. The gravity here is quite low, and the Successors you see here tower over you even more noticeably than on other worlds. There are several cities on the surface, most along the equator.`
		description `Shielded from the persistent asteroid impacts of this system by its parent gas giant, Mavra-Sol-Kvel enjoys a temperate climate and spectacular vistas. The low gravity here is greatly appreciated by the Successors, and consequently the moon supports a substantial population despite its small size, most of whom live in several cities along the equator. It also allows for a number of towering mountain ranges, many containing cliffs and canyons several kilometers high that are frequently visited by tourists and thrill-seeker pilots alike.`
	planet "Mebla's Portion"
		description `A stormy world with unpredictable and rapidly changing weather, Mebla's Portion is nonetheless home to several billion Arachi and millions of members of the other Coalition species, in part because rent is cheaper here than on worlds with more idyllic weather. Many of the residents are artists or work in other creative fields that allow them to work from home on days when the weather is too violent for them to venture outside.`
	planet Melatos
		description `Despite being a large rocky world, Melatos lacks all but the thinnest of atmospheres. Avgi astrogeologists have determined that some cataclysmic event millions of years ago melted and quickly refroze the outermost layers of its crust, coinciding with a mass extinction on Aviskir. This rapid cooling created a world with a smooth, marble-like texture, in part made from ceramic. The glassy surface is crazed by deep cracks, formed as the crust refroze and shrank as it cooled.`
		description `		The remelting of Melatos' crust also means that heavier elements such as metals mostly sank to the core, making mining an unattractive prospect with the planet's relatively deep gravity well. As such, Melatos remains mostly undeveloped, with the settlements on its surface being almost exclusively scientific in purpose.`
	planet Melenci
		description `While the southern world of Jentu Le is where genetic research is mainly done, the small moon of Melenci here in the north is where much of that research is put to practice. The moon has only one settlement where Bunrodeans come to receive modifications to their genome. However, the Bunrodeans ensure that any modifications that are done will affect only the individual they are being done to, and will not be passed down to any offspring.`
	planet Memory
		description `Memory is a dry world, but with enough local plants to maintain a breathable atmosphere. Some of the indigenous forms of cactus-like, drought-resistant plants grow dozens of meters high. Most of the animals that have evolved here are nocturnal.`
		description `		This planet was first settled only a few centuries ago, and the population is still relatively low, but they have developed a diverse set of industries including manufacturing and medical research.`
	planet "Mendez Station"
		description `Mendez Station is the closest object to Alpherg's twin stars. Constructed by the CCOR as part of its efforts to build self-sufficiency in the Outer Rim, the station's gigantic ramscoops collect charged particles from the system's solar winds and refine them into hyperdrive fuel.`
		description `		Since its establishment, Mendez has been uninhabited for most of its operational life. The station's location makes it uncomfortably hot, and as a result, Mendez is almost entirely automated apart from a small control room used during maintenance.`
	planet "Merask Fortuno"
		description `This station was built primarily for harvesting hyperspace fuel. Even when the Korath were still here, the harvesting was almost entirely automated, so the station only has living quarters for a handful of people.`
	planet Mere
		description `Mere is a world almost entirely covered by oceans. The locals live most of their lives on enormous ships, almost like floating cities, which travel around collecting fish and seaweed for food or harvesting pearls from the shallows to be sold off-world. The city-ships must do their best to avoid certain latitudes where hurricanes are most common, and even so storms are a continuous threat to anyone who lives here. Weather conditions are tracked constantly by a network of satellites.`
	planet "Mereti Station"
		description `This large station serves as the "mission control" for the robotic ships of the Kor Mereti faction. Warships of every shape and design are clustered in its docking bays or flying patrol outside.`
	planet Methuselah
		description `This world feels ancient, and the air is calm as if the last storm ended millennia ago. A continuous deep sound from below seems to tell a story from the early days of the universe - memories of hotter and faster times.`
		description `		From time to time giant creatures can be seen floating through the atmosphere in total peace.`
	planet "Miblulub's Plenty"
		description `Miblulub's Plenty was the first colony created by the Arachi outside of their home system, founded at a time when their home world could not produce enough food to reliably feed its entire population. This planet has long seasons and plentiful rainfall that make its temperate zones ideal for farming, while the grasslands near the tropics are mostly used for longcow ranching. Longcows are a distinctive and ill-behaved species of multi-legged cattle; their meat is a key part of the Arach diet.`
	planet Midgard
		description `Midgard is a world with as much geographic diversity as Earth itself: mountains, tundra, desert, oceans, marshes, plains. It was the second world in the Deep to be settled, seven centuries ago. It is now home to dozens of major metropolitan areas and a population of over four billion. Although a select few live outside the cities and work in farming or ranching, the vast majority of people here have jobs in manufacturing.`
		description `		Food, fashion, and entertainment here all strike you as out of pace with broader galactic culture. The deep independent history of the planet makes it less likely to simply follow the latest Earth trends as the more recent colonies do.`
	planet "Midway Emerald"
		description `Wealthy Kimek prefer to live as close as possible to the centers of power, and in Coalition space the center of power is the Heliarch ringworlds. The dwellings here are a bit more luxurious and less densely packed than on other Kimek worlds, and the total population is less than two billion. Outside the cities, this is a hot forest world, without much local industry or natural resources.`
	planet Millrace
		description `Millrace is an overpopulated world, full of factories and manufacturing plants. It is one of several planets in this region of space where people trying to escape from the crowded squalor and polluted cities of Earth come looking for work. Most of the goods manufactured here end up being used by the Syndicate for constructing starships or driving industry on other worlds.`
		description `		The Syndicate is a fair employer: living conditions here may be squalid, but most workers are earning a living wage and some are able to save up for a new life on a more pleasant planet. The Syndicate trusts there will never be a shortage of new immigrants to replace them.`
	planet Mirrorlake
		description `The Hai homeworld is orbited by a moon that is large and dense enough to have been able to hold on to its own supply of surface water, and although the atmosphere is cold, much of that water is in liquid form due to the strong tides. In a few places, granite and basalt cliffs rise out of the water, and the Hai have built a few small settlements on the moon, as well.`
	planet Mnai
		description `The environment of this world is quite pleasant by human standards. A majority of Mnai's yearly seasons consist of extended warm summer periods that provide healthy conditions for wildlife to thrive. Canyons are a common sight, sometimes harboring their own smaller ecosystems both in their higher mountainous regions and down in the valleys. Other patches of Mnai's surface have mesas that are home to mammals that look like large bears with antlers.`
		description `		Although this world remains an uncolonized paradise, there is some indication that the planet has been visited recently by the Gegno. A few landing sites can be found atop the taller ridges, but none are intricate enough to indicate any attempt to establish a settlement.`
	planet Moonshake
		description `Moonshake is a planet of overpopulated cities side by side with dense wilderness. A few centuries ago it became a local center of industrial production when the Syndicate began building factories here. Since then, immigrants looking for steady work have been pouring in, doubling the planet's population every few decades. It is now a regional center for the production of everything from textiles to molded plastic parts to reactor-grade plutonium.`
		description `		It is characteristic of the Syndicate that the wilderness is entirely ignored, both scientifically and agriculturally, until it is plowed under to make way for expanding industry. Nowhere else in the galaxy is the local fauna so plentiful and yet so poorly characterized.`
	planet Mordente-Bridi
		description `A testament to the ingenuity of the engineering corps of the now defunct Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim, the massive Mordente-Bridi Station is one of the largest in human space. Twin cylinders Mordente and Bridi make up the station's hull, built from the strongest alloy the CCOR could manufacture at scale. Bridi Cylinder is pressurized and contains crew quarters and logistical infrastructure amounting to that of a sizable city, while Mordente Cylinder contains what was the Outer Rim's main shipyard.`
	planet Mosaa-Oa-Vyret
		description `This small planet hosts a population of towering octopus-like aliens. They have built several cities across its surface that are highly symmetrical, filled with organic-looking curved buildings draped in colorful fabrics that shimmer in the light. The air is damp and chilly; rainstorms blanket a significant portion of the planet's surface and many of the sleek-looking vessels that set down in the spaceport discharge streams of water upon landing.`
		description `Mosaa-Oa-Vyret's location in the only hyperspace link between the northern and southern parts of Successor territory has made it a hub for interstellar trade and the center of Successor commerce.`
		description `		Unique among all Successor planets, its primary employer is not one of the High Houses but an independent corporation responsible for manufacturing, among other things, the Pulse Laser. The High Houses are understandably somewhat perturbed by this autonomy, but have allowed independent commerce to continue here in exchange for levying modest taxes on transactions that do not go through their official channels.`
	planet "Muninn Station"
		description `Muninn Station, along with its brother station Huginn, serves as the gateway to the region of space known as the Deep. They both harvest and refine deuterium for use as rocket fuel, and in addition Muninn Station is used as a military base for the local defense fleets.`
	planet Muspel
		description `Muspel is a hot world of deserts, canyons, and warm-water oceans. It is mostly a mining and manufacturing planet, and as a result there are few lifelong inhabitants; most of the people here are migrant workers who are just trying to save up enough money to settle down somewhere more hospitable.`
		description `		Some tourists also come here, to walk through the sandstone canyons where the wind and rain has carved the rock into tall pillars and spires. A few particularly beautiful canyons are protected against strip mining by local law.`
	planet Mutiny
		description `Centuries ago, Mutiny was used as a sort of prison world for a powerful band of pirates, a place where rivals could be marooned or held for ransom, rather than killing them outright. It is a cold, dark planet, and food is scarce, but over time several villages developed in the more hospitable regions. No longer prisoners, the inhabitants who remain do so because they prefer a simple life beyond the reach of any government, on a planet that will never be stolen from them because it carries nothing of value.`
	planet Myiara-Aret-Iir
		description `In contrast to the pristine emptiness of the other formerly-inhabited planets in this area of space, this world teems with signs of chaos. The remains of hastily-built weather-control towers dot much of its surface, and the cities upon it are neither majestic nor well-maintained; none are very large, but most are surrounded by vast expanses of fabric and radiation-bleached temporary constructions.`
		description `Once a minor colony world, what would come to be known as Myiara-Aret-Iir was the last stop of all those hoping to escape the decay of the Predecessors' space by traveling through the wormhole. Those who had wealthy patrons that could finance prompt transport spent little time here, but those without often found the blossoming shanty towns of the planet to be their new homes. With the denouement of the Predecessors' last inter-House war and the final push to evacuate, most of those living here eventually made it through. The rest probably perished long ago.`
	planet Myiara-Sola-Tej
		description `This abandoned station appears to remain technically habitable, if one doesn't mind breathing the poorly-recycled and dusty air.`
		description `This industrial station was constructed during the arrival of the New Houses to exploit the mineral wealth of this system, but was abandoned when richer and more accessible mineral deposits were found planetside. It still remains technically habitable, but none of the High Houses have had an interest in refurbishing it, since cheaper and easier industrial and habitation projects are consistently available.`
	planet Mystery
		description `The Saryd culture's fascination with the movement of the stars and planets can perhaps be attributed to the fact that their homeworld is orbited by two moons, which cause a complex and seemingly unpredictable cycle of tides as well as a variety of subtle effects on the circadian rhythms of the creatures that evolved on Saros. Saryd homes on other worlds often have night lighting cycles designed to mimic the moons of their homeworld.`
	planet Naph-Naap-Kella
		description `This planet is deep in the throes of its early history, with a thick sulfurous atmosphere concealing an unstable and volcanically active surface. Mineral-rich pools simmer next to lava flows and crumbling ejecta, and the atmosphere is repeatedly lit up by enormous cloud-to-cloud lightning discharges that leave the hull of your ship crackling with static electricity.`
		description `This planet is deep in the throes of its early history, with a thick sulfurous atmosphere concealing an unstable and volcanically active surface. Despite that, the Successors have discovered very simple life forms here, possibly the very first life that has developed on this planet. Consequently, it is of some interest to Successor biologists, or at least the ones willing to brave the toxic and destructive conditions on the surface.`
	planet Naphir
		description `Naphir was the chosen destination, and ultimately the final resting place, of an ill-fated early interstellar expedition. The Avgi pioneers who volunteered for the mission knew well in advance that the system lacked any garden planets, but set out regardless; all of them were well prepared to spend the rest of their lives in orbital stations. Finding a cool, airless moon around a gas giant, the colonists settled down and began constructing habitats and gathering essential resources.`
		description `		Unfortunately, Span is prone to violent eruptions, and a coronal mass ejection struck after less than a year. With most precision machinery left aboard their orbiting starship, it was severely degraded; without that, the colony slowly succumbed to equipment failure until the last living Avgi recorded a farewell poem that remains famous to this day.`
	planet Nasqueron
		description `Beneath Nasqueron's cloudy surface is a complex and thriving ecosystem of gas-dwelling organisms, from the massive void sprites all the way down to bacteria that inhabit tiny water droplets suspended in the air. Although the void sprites mostly feed on these organisms, it appears that in order to grow into their adult form or to give birth to young, they also need rare minerals that they can only find by feeding on asteroids, far beyond the planet's atmosphere.`
	planet "Navigeo Yards"
		description `Navigeo is a station designed to be a dedicated shipyard, with dozens of modular dry docks capable of quickly laying down new ships or repairing damaged ones. Overall, almost all of the large warships in service of the Twilight Guard are built here, though efforts are being made to decentralize warship production for the sake of survivability.`
		description `		Due to its importance and nature as a government-operated shipyard, the station is managed by the Twilight Guard directly. An oversight board appointed by the Assembly maintains a level of civilian governance, but given the composition of the station's population, this is clearly a military installation first and foremost.`
	planet "Nearby Jade"
		description `Aside from fish, the Kimek diet is mostly vegetarian, but a few centuries ago an Arach entrepreneur decided to start ranching longcows here. It is an ideal world for ranching, with plenty of grassy fields. The ranches have begun a major industry, although generally only the wealthiest of Kimek are willing to spend money on longcow meat.`
	planet Nepheritis
		description `An unusually large ice giant, Nepheritis is well-known among the denizens of the Paradise Planets for its prodigious rains of large diamonds. While this phenomenon is common on most ice giants of sufficient size, Nepheritis is a scientific curiosity due to the sheer size of the diamonds formed in its atmosphere, with some even becoming large boulders during their plummet into the depths.`
		description `		While these diamonds are unfortunately not economical to collect with current human technology, if you were so inclined you could perhaps make an attempt at catching one as it fell, deep within the atmosphere where they are largest.`
	planet Neriene
		description `While lacking its iconic ferrous-red color, this planet is eerily similar in conditions to the second planet humanity set foot on, Mars. The thin atmosphere of carbon dioxide, the polar ice caps, and the echoes of dried waterways across the surface all tell the tragic tale of the same fate that befell Mars in eons past.`
		description `		Even though humanity eventually triumphed over the adverse conditions and made a home on the Red Planet, this near-identical world has been left totally barren, a mere afterthought in the now interstellar human civilization.`
	planet "New Argentina"
		description `New Argentina is a world that is ideal for ranching but suitable for little else. Ranchers live as individual families or small communities surrounded by hectares of grazing land for cattle. As a result, the population is still quite low here, and the locals live isolated lives, with most families living many kilometers away from the nearest school or hospital or even from their nearest neighbor.`
		description `		Cattle handlers here do their work on horseback, because they believe modern vehicles are more likely to spook the animals.`
	planet "New Austria"
		description `New Austria is a rugged mountain world, full of snow-capped peaks and valleys so deep and so steep that they rarely see sunlight.`
		description `		The few settlements that have been built here were developed for mining sapphires and rubies. The sapphires found in New Austria range from blue to yellow to black to clear in color, and are used both for industrial abrasives and for jewelry.`
		description `		For centuries the locals have been trying to find a deposit of diamonds, which would sell for much higher prices than sapphires, and local folklore revolves around the prosperity that would come to this world if diamonds were ever discovered.`
	planet "New Boston"
		description `New Boston is a completely unremarkable world... except, of course, for the fact that you happen to have been born here.`
		description `		Most of the land is wet and marshy, and the coastal regions are prone to flooding. Some food crops are grown here, but most of the farmers instead plant flax and jute, which grow well in wet soil and are used to make linen and burlap cloth. The textile mills are hot and poorly ventilated, but they offer higher and more reliable income than farming.`
	planet "New Britain"
		description `New Britain is one of the few worlds in the Dirt Belt region of the galaxy that is relatively prosperous and has a large population. Although the gravity here is slightly low, it is otherwise a nearly ideal Earth-like world, rich enough in natural resources that all the raw materials for the local industry can come from on-planet.`
		description `		Among the native life forms, the most striking are the many species of large and colorful birds, most of which have learned to give the cities and the spaceport a wide berth.`
	planet "New China"
		description `In the very early days of hyperspace travel, most settlers chose to put down roots within a few jumps of Earth, because until more fuel depots were built, colonies farther out would seldom be visited by cargo ships. As a result, a lot of effort was put into terraforming and developing worlds that would have been passed over by most colonists today.`
		description `		New China is one such world, and it is now overpopulated, and poor enough that maintaining the terraforming equipment and climate requires almost a third of the planetary government's tax income.`
	planet "New Finding"
		description `Due to complex atmospheric currents and swiftly changing seasons, the surface of New Finding is constantly scoured by powerful winds, making it difficult for soil to accumulate except in sheltered canyons and gorges. Each of these patches of greenery stands like an island amid a sea of bare rock. Over time, where the forests are able to take hold and grow, they spread outward and begin to turn more of the rock into habitable soil. On the exposed slopes, rock slides are a constant danger.`
		description `		Due to the limited habitable land, the local economy focuses on high tech medicine and equipment that can be produced by relatively small laboratories.`
	planet "New Greenland"
		description `New Greenland was first settled about six hundred years ago, at the peak of the "Turf Wars" era where most planets were controlled by powerful corporations and their struggles often turned into outright warfare with privately owned fleets and armies. The people who came to New Greenland were looking for a world so marginal and undesirable that they could live here in peace without being caught in the crossfire.`
		description `		The locals here grow food in greenhouses and specialize in making warm winter clothing, which is this planet's only export.`
	planet "New Holland"
		description `Like its namesake on ancient Earth, New Holland is a world of oceans and low country. It is an old planet, its tectonic activity long since silenced, worn smooth by eons of weather. For those who live here, flooding is a constant threat, requiring a vast network of dikes and levees. But the floods also refresh the soil, making this one of the most fertile farming worlds in the region.`
		description `		As the population has boomed, and as the farms have been consolidated and become more mechanized, large cities have grown to house factories and workers.`
	planet "New Iceland"
		description `New Iceland is a perpetually hazy volcanic world, with a slightly caustic atmosphere but enough reserves of metal and petrochemicals to draw a large number of settlers. Some of those settlers also make a living as farmers, and a few well-developed factory towns produce goods for export to other worlds.`
		description `		Many of the inhabitants wear dust masks to avoid letting the particulate matter from the volcanoes accumulate in their lungs.`
	planet "New India"
		description `New India was first settled less than a century ago, and the settlers are still struggling to establish themselves. It is a hospitable climate, but the amount of labor needed to clear forests and to plow rocky fields has meant that the towns here can only grow very slowly.`
		description `		The farms grow both food crops and cotton, and very recently they have begun manufacturing their own textiles instead of just shipping the raw cotton off-world for processing.`
	planet "New Kansas"
		description `Wool clothing is considered a luxury in most of human space, because enough oil is mined on most planets to make synthetic clothing much cheaper than raising and shearing sheep. However, here on New Kansas, wool is the primary industry.`
		description `		The land is mostly rolling green hills and shallow streams, ideal for grazing. However, unwary travelers hiking through the idyllic countryside have been known to be attacked by savage packs of feral sheep, so this world is not without unique dangers of its own.`
	planet "New Portland"
		description `New Portland is a cloudy planet orbiting a dim star; the only reason it is not completely frozen is because of the heat trapped by its upper atmosphere. There are only a handful of towns here, and nothing big enough to warrant being called a city. Most of the settlers are subsistence farmers who can only dream about life on other worlds. Many houses here do not even have running water or personal computers.`
		description `		Some of the farms near the spaceport are planted with different crops forming abstract patterns visible from the air. Such a whimsical extravagance seems particularly odd when you consider that the owners will never be able to afford to see their fields from that angle. But perhaps that is precisely the point.`
	planet "New Sahara"
		description `New Sahara is mostly desert and savanna, with very little precipitation.`
		description `		A century ago, some entrepreneurs settled here and built a factory complex that is entirely powered by wind and solar energy, because there are so few cloudy days here and the wind and sunshine are so reliable. The factory is mostly autonomous, with only a few thousand people living here to perform maintenance or to grow crops in irrigated fields.`
	planet "New Switzerland"
		description `New Switzerland is a world where tectonic activity has left deeply folded and fractured mountains across much of the planet's surface.`
		description `		In many places, the topsoil is too thin and rocky to support farming, but many people have settled here anyway, drawn to the beauty of the mountains. A few ski resorts operate in the mountains, and in recent years a gemstone mining industry has begun to develop as well.`
	planet "New Tibet"
		description `New Tibet is a world of jagged mountains and deeply shadowed valleys.`
		description `		Although it has been inhabited for centuries, in many places the terrain is so rugged that roads cannot be built, leaving several of the smaller towns almost completely isolated. Taking advantage of this isolation, several orders of Buddhist monks have built monasteries here.`
		description `		In the lowlands, large farms support sprawling cities full of factories, a striking contrast to the simplicity and isolation of the mountain villages.`
	planet "New Tortuga"
		description `A planet of violent storms and frequent earthquakes, New Tortuga does not have a lot to offer the average spacefarer. The most significant settlements on the planet are built predominantly underground, far from any fault lines, with only obscure, hardened access areas. Combined with the fortress-like blast doors that blockade the spaceport entrances, New Tortuga is the perfect place for those looking for somewhere to hide.`
		description `		Most of the inhabitants of this planet are Syndicate dissidents who mainly support themselves through manufacturing. The Syndicate often destroys pirate factories at their borders, but their fleets do not find the monetary cost of venturing as far as New Tortuga worth the benefit. Here, shipyards, factories, and outfitters provide a continuous supply of goods and services for the system.`
	planet "New Wales"
		description `New Wales is home to a few mining outposts which extract and refine rare earth minerals and heavy metals. It is dangerous work: the mines are deep underground and prone to noxious gases and cave-ins, and the refineries work with molten radioactive materials and caustic chemicals.`
		description `		Due to the somewhat dim light of the star Algorel, and the cloudiness of the atmosphere, this is not a good world for farming, and the population remains quite small.`
	planet "New Washington"
		description `New Washington is a planet huddled close to a dim, red sun in an otherwise frozen system. It orbits so close to the sun that the two are locked together, with one side of New Washington continuously facing the sun and the other in perpetual darkness.`
		description `		The only villages are in the twilight region in between, and there the settlers make a living by mining for metal and for oil, a relic of a warmer period when more life flourished here and the planet spun more quickly on its axis.`
	planet Newhome
		description `Newhome's gravity, climate, and geography is very similar to the Hai homeworld. Several billion Hai live here. Most dwell in large factory cities, but there are also ranches in the undeveloped areas where the Hai raise animals that are larger than elephants but produce wool similar to sheep. Shearing them is a dangerous undertaking, but their wool can be used to make excellent, long-lasting clothing.`
	planet Nifel
		description `Nifel is a cold world, with summers too short to grow most crops, and very little indigenous wildlife aside from thick-furred mammals and some migratory birds that travel from one hemisphere to the other every year.`
		description `		Four centuries ago, when much of human space had been in travel quarantine for a decade to block the spread of the Rigellian Plague, it was here that researchers discovered a cryophilic bacterium growing in the permafrost that could be used to combat and eventually eliminate the plague. Some research labs and manufacturing plants still remain in operation here.`
	planet Nilokep
		description `Silently orbiting its distant parent, Nilokep is a dead, airless world of stony flats and salt plains. Granite mountains jut up at the poles, but any tectonic heat this small world may have once had has long since bled away.`
		description `		Curiously, Nilokep has an elevated level of ambient background radiation, largely due to the dispersion of pulverized granite, containing trace amounts of uranium, across its surface. While not economical to mine, it is thought that this is the remnant of some ancient geological system that eroded and dispersed the planet's primordial mountains.`
	planet Nimbus
		description `Nimbus is a stormy ocean world, where a rain shower can descend on you almost without warning, only to be replaced with equal suddenness by bright sunshine. It draws mostly the sort of people who can weather such changes with placid, unperturbed calm; tourist guidebooks often rank Nimbus near the top in their lists of "friendliest natives."`
		description `		All the industry on Nimbus is driven by the sea. Fish are plentiful, and the oceans here also contain some unique microorganisms that are harvested to extract useful medical compounds.`
	planet "Nisos Cylinder"
		description `The Nisos Cylinder was once a huge habitat station, of the same type as the O'Neil Cylinder concept from Earth's 20th century. With a population of nearly twelve million, Nisos was one of nearly a thousand cylinders created by the Avgi, mostly in the Anax system, where they were together home to billions. As the Aberrant advanced across Avgi space, it was evacuated in a frenzy that saw most of its population flee to Aviskir. Compared to its neighbors, it is relatively intact, and still holds an atmosphere.`
		description `		Located at the L5 Lagrange point of Oura, the largest gas giant in the Anax system, this habitat community had ready access to the asteroids that tended to accumulate here, which fueled the expansion and production of new cylinders.`
	planet Noluc
		description `Even if it was something other than a lifeless, metal-poor desert planet, Noluc would have a hard time attracting settlers. The angry red-orange color that coats the planet's sandy wastes is actually created by a simple neurotoxin lethal to both humans and Avgi. While technically harmless in its dry state, any exposure to water will dissolve the dust into solution, rendering it into a potent poison capable of killing with even microscopic doses.`
	planet Norn
		description `Norn is a water world, with low gravity but an atmosphere dense enough to breathe easily. Large mats of seaweed and algae form natural rafts that drift around with the ocean currents, and a few intrepid settlers have colonized them, people who prefer a life of relative solitude and are willing to trust their fates to wherever the winds might take them. Others have settled the few, low islands, which are prone to frequent flooding.`
		description `		Fish are common here, including a few species of flying fish which travel in large packs and are a considerable nuisance for the land-dwellers.`
	planet O-Vasa-Oa
		description `This binary planet is the collective seat of what are known as the New Houses, the noble families who traveled through the wormhole to this region of space during the collapse of the Predecessors' empire. Many within the New Houses object to that moniker, arguing that their family lines are in fact the more extensive and noble and that they should be categorized by that, rather than their time of arrival.`
		description `		Despite population surges in recent years, O-Vasa-Oa remains relatively sparsely populated. The tidal forces from its binary partner create high winds that sweep across the landscape, making settlement challenging in undeveloped areas, and expensive even in those that have the infrastructure to support it.`
	planet Oasis
		description `Although much of Oasis is desert, a few tropical regions exist that are more suited to human habitation. The settlements are small, and rely mostly on agriculture, ranching, and textiles to produce goods that can be sold off-world.`
		description `		For those who are drawn to simple frontier living, it is a paradise, where you can earn a living just by working with your hands, and where the only mode of transportation anyone needs is a horse. Many outsiders, of course, view the Oasis lifestyle as backward and primitive.`
	planet "Oberon Station"
		description `Oberon Station is a deuterium refinery owned and operated by the Syndicate, and aside from a few docking bays for visiting ships to use in an emergency, the rest of the station is sealed off to non-employees.`
	planet Oblivion
		description `The atmosphere here is a toxic mix of ammonia, sulfur, and methane. Although breathable by human beings if necessary, the locals use masks to reduce the risk of chronic respiratory problems. Even so, the life expectancy here is short, but that is partly because the two best-paying industries are oil drilling and mining for radioactive elements.`
	planet Occupas
		description `There are no places to land on this planet, so you end up simply gliding through the upper layers of clouds. From time to time giant shadows appear in the deeper layers, but they never stay long. This gas giant has relatively calm weather; the winds are mild and storms do not appear very often.`
	planet Ochrescoop
		description `A massive plaque attached to a bulkhead in the promenade entry proudly indicates that station has been run by Yoot Ki Magnetic Fuel Harvesting for over 75,000 years. It seems that the powerful magnetic field of the gas giant below makes this station an ideal location for harvesting and re-harvesting the massive volume of fuel demanded by the Hai space industry. Despite its long history of operation, the station seems to be in an excellent state of repair.`
	planet "Ogmur's Siphon"
		description `This refinery was built shortly after the nearby dry dock station was finished, to ensure the system was self-sufficient to provide the hyperspace fuel needed for the visiting ships. A small fleet of tanker ships is docked on specially marked hangar bays, always ready to bring the fuel elsewhere if needed.`
		description `		"Ogmur" is the name of the gas giant below, named after a giant snake-like creature of Arach mythology. With an abnormally dense core and storms more ruthless than in any other gas giants in the Coalition, it swallowed the first five predecessors of this station before they could be completed, and though this one has remained in a stable orbit for thousands of years after its completion, superstition surrounding the planet makes it so that the Siphon receives very few visitors.`
	planet Okoity
		description `Due to an overabundance of natural resources and arable land when the planet was discovered, Okoity has achieved the highest population of any Bunrodean world, with a staggering 24 billion people. All but the most inhospitable regions of the planet have been settled in some shape or form.`
		description `		Unfortunately, time has taken its toll on the planet, as the once prosperous lands have run dry as a result of millennia of industrial habitation. While the planet isn't completely barren of natural resources, an increasing large amount of supplies must be brought in from other worlds to sustain the population.`
	planet Olohoa
		description `From afar, Olohoa looks like it might be a pleasant place to live, with clear oceans not too dissimilar to what you might find on a Paradise World. But your ship's sensors tell you a different story, one of a planet with immense amounts of ultraviolet radiation bombarding its surface. Nothing short of an extremophile could survive on the surface here, and any life in the oceans is likely deep down where no radiation can reach.`
	planet Omanet
		description `Omanet is thought to be a chthonian world, a former gas giant whose atmosphere was stripped away until the rocky core was left bare. For whatever reason, Omanet went a step further, and its silicate crust and mantle were also boiled off. Left behind was a dense world made almost entirely out of metal, captured around Avalet as a large moon.`
		description `		Despite its unfavorable position deep in Anax's gravity well, Omanet was heavily industrialized. Numerous factories churned out enormous orbital mirrors, made from nickel-iron and silver, which were then launched around Anax. This swarm collected sunlight, beaming it across the system. Some Avgi predicted that the swarm would grow to eventually cover the entire star, but at the current rate of construction it would take millennia to exploit a fraction of Anax's output.`
	planet Orodens
		description `This moon is speculated to have once been much larger, until some event stripped it of its crust and mantle. Now, only the metal-rich core remains, serving as an alluring target abundant in heavy elements. More recently, Orodens is thought to have supported a hydrological cycle for a brief period, creating rich veins of precipitated minerals. However, the high surface gravity made it costly to transport material off the surface and to other systems. Rows of mass drivers were used to fire refined minerals into orbit, where they could be collected by waiting ships.`
		description `		Once the largest single source of fissile elements in Avgi space, the mass drivers have been silent since the Incursion halted operations. Automated drones continue to watch over the last batch of excavated material.`
	planet Osaeli
		description `An Earth-like planet with high biodiversity, at first glance Osaeli appears to be an idyllic world where no lifeform ever became predominant; but looking more closely, the signs of an ancient devastation can still be seen. In the middle of the forests, huge amounts of debris are scattered across large areas, and scans reveal many underground bunkers, partly destroyed and filled with water.`
	planet Osolaa-Val-Mavra
		description `This moon is covered in a constant veil of frost that coats the sparse and hardy vegetation on its surface in delicate ice crystals. On the side of the moon that faces its parent gas giant, a massive circular trench, kilometers-deep, has been carved into the earth. Within it, huge terraced complexes have been built into the walls; empty residential areas, shipyards, and public spaces jut into the trench's open air where they are adorned by the constant snowfall.`
		description `The moon of Osolaa-Val-Mavra was one of the first worlds of the Predecessors to evacuate as a consequence of the deterioration of their space. House Sejra ran massive transport ships for seven years to and from the surface in an effort to move its citizens offworld and into neighboring systems. By the time they were done, Sejra's coffers were dry and its government on the brink of collapse, and the citizens it had gone to such effort to relocate were stranded in systems that were starting to show the same signs of decay as their one-time home. The desolate habitation trench and ice-covered surface of the moon are testaments to Sejra's folly; of trying to escape something they did not understand and had no hope of stopping.`
	planet "Oup Je"
		description `The many beveling formations here provide the Gegno Scin with a rich amount of materials for their cities and ships. Below are small woodlands that seem to be stripped down one way or another, with few living areas scattered about. It is apparent that this planet has been worn down over time, due to both natural and unnatural causes.`
	planet Oura
		description `Oura is the largest and fastest rotating gas giant in the Anax system, with an extensive system of moons rich in mineral wealth. The planet itself is immense, but has an unusually low density for a gas planet of its size. Large quantities of nitrogen, sulfides, and ammonia give it a ruddy color tinged with a blue-white glow, with wavy bands folding over each other as they ripple with the winds.`
		description `		Oura was the primary source of the helium-3 that fueled the best of the fusion-driven Avgi sublight starships. Even now, you can see aerostat collectors floating on the wind as they separate valuable isotopes from the surrounding gas. Pressurized vessels filled with these riches are then launched to orbit, mostly via mass driver.`
	planet "Outpost Alkos"
		description `Predating the Incursion, Outpost Alkos was the first major refueling station built in the Tangled Shroud. While it continues to harvest deuterium and helium-3 from the gas giant below, it has largely been supplanted by smaller, less centralized ice-based deuterium refineries. This has led to a degree of neglect by the Assembly, and a posting here is generally regarded as a minor punishment.`
		description `		As a result, the station's crew has been thoroughly penetrated by those with sympathies to the Dissonance.`
	planet "Outpost Enka"
		description `Outpost Enka is a huge station built between two large asteroids, which are steadily being mined for the metals and minerals they contain. Most of the habitat is freestanding, mounted on the spar that links both asteroids, but one asteroid is also riddled with pressurized tunnels and pockets filled with farms and open green spaces.`
		description `		Outpost Enka is a major source of nickel-iron ore, which is common in the system despite the overall metal-poor state of the Tangled Shroud. The station is rumored to be a haven for rebels and dissidents even beyond the usual Dissonance supporters.`
	planet "Outpost Leto"
		description `Outpost Leto is one of the most recent constructions in the Tangled Shroud, built into a Kuiper belt object far from its primary. Large inflated domes, housing those unfortunate enough to be stationed here, dot an icy surface slathered in reddish tholins and chunks of frozen hydrocarbons. It is these very hydrocarbons and organic compounds that Outpost Leto was built to mine, shipping them in bulk to stations in the Outer Limits to support their environmental systems and ecosystems.`
	planet "Outpost Pilos"
		description `Outpost Pilos is a large early warning station set up soon after the Avgi decided to settle beyond the Tangled Shroud. Fearful of the Aberrant managing to overcome their supposed aversion to the mazelike region of space, it was quickly decided that a tripwire would be needed to warn of an incursion in the event of the fall of the Feo Platform and the infestation of the Tangled Shroud with Aberrations. However, when a large-scale attack never materialized, Outpost Pilos quickly found a second use as an intermediary waystation for the trade of minerals from the Tangled Shroud with the settlements beyond it.`
		description `		Enormous radar arrays and infrared telescopes make up the bulk of the station, but more recent additions include several large external bays where raw resources and cargo can be transferred between ships.`
	planet "Outpost Tekis"
		description `Outpost Tekis is a station built into an enormous asteroid, with tunnels and habitats throughout its entire volume. Its surface is littered with pressurized tubes and habitat domes, many of which grow massive amounts of food in farms and gardens.`
		description `		The complex is a major exporter of titanium and other rare metals, which are otherwise very scarce in the metal-poor Tangled Shroud. A local chapter of the Dissonance movement is openly headquartered there, and is often the public face of negotiations with the Consonance's Assembly.`
	planet Palarei
		description `While its short distance from Gerenus makes it seem only barely capable of supporting life, Palarei's surface is full of thickets of a small spiky bush native to this planet. Oddly enough, very few settlements on the planet appear to have been destroyed by weapons fire; most facilities are covered in meters of dust and sand but, other than that, appear to be quite operative.`
	planet Palatine
		description `The whipping winds of Palatine are a prime example of how the inner mechanics of gas giants are poorly understood; when it was initially discovered by the Remnant, its winds spun around the globe at speeds far in excess of what astrophysical models predicted, as if they had recently been subject to a massive acceleration.`
		description `		Over the subsequent centuries the winds have been imperceptibly slowing toward normally predicted velocities, but at their current rate it will be many millennia before they reach them.`
	planet Palos
		description `A cool desert world, Palos hosts a surface temperature suitable for habitation, but an unbreathable carbon dioxide atmosphere and deep gravity well has precluded any large scale settlement here. Had it been present in the Anax system, it very likely would have been an attractive target for terraforming, but with the natural beauty of nearby Cyreal free for the taking the Avgi of the Thread system declined to spend their scarce resources on the comparatively barren Palos.`
		description `		Panspermia spread various anaerobic fungi and bacteria from Cyreal to Palos long ago, and while they have taken poorly to the planet's conditions you can still occasionally find a mottled bacterial film growing over the alkaline soil, or something resembling lichen spotting a rock.`
	planet Parii'het
		description `Very similar to its sister station of Seli'het, Parii'het was still under construction when it was abandoned by its creators. Today, it floats uninhabited in this rarely visited section of space, approached occasionally by the automated drones that mindlessly continue to carry new supplies to the massive cargo section. If the Ka'het attacked this station, it would be made entirely inoperable in a short time.`
	planet Passaritus
		description `Decades ago, Passaritus was the subject of an ambitious project by the Deep to mine metallic hydrogen from its mantle. Being barely large enough to form metallic hydrogen in the first place, the gas giant's gravity was thought to be low enough to make extraction feasible. Unfortunately, the Deep had overestimated their ability to build an extraction device that was not only functional, but economical, and the project has since been moved to the backburner.`
		description `		Passaritus still happens to be an interesting locale to visit, at least if you have a gaslined ship. Its small size and relatively rapid rotation gives it sweeping bands of color, each corresponding to a different layer or wind speed, and the lower gravity allows updrafts to carry your ship upwards for kilometers.`
	planet Pearl
		description `Pearl is an idyllic, forested world, mostly set aside as a wildlife sanctuary for imported exotic species. Each of the islands and continents houses animals and plants from a different planet's biosphere. Terraforming stations and satellites maintain the atmospheric gas levels in order to keep each island at the proper temperature and rainfall level.`
		description `		Some of the islands are open for tourists and safari tours, and even for hunting. Others are owned by private companies and used for medical research. People with training in veterinary medicine are always in high demand here.`
	planet "Pelubta Station"
		description `Pelubta Station was built shortly after the Arachi discovered the hyperdrive, initially to take advantage of the massive amounts of solar power generated by the nearby stars. However, now it is mainly used as a hyperspace fuel refinery. Although it has endured some solar flares, constant maintenance means that the station still doesn't show its age.`
		description `		Pelubta Station is also used to study one of the binary stars in this system, since it has a similar makeup and age to one orbited by a Heliarch ringworld. Most of this research is focused on predicting stellar phenomena, especially the most abnormal ones.`
	planet "Periaxle Circuit"
		description `The first structure of such scale the Coalition ever built, this station was designed and fully built before the War of Independence. Originally a Saryd attempt at emulating the Quarg's own ringworlds, almost all living quarters and amenities were stripped away over the course of the war in favor of a gigantic particle accelerator used by the Saryds to research weapons and shielding technology. Nowadays, its use has shifted into a more general-purpose research facility.`
		description `		Completed dozens of centuries before the war, the structure's original plating failed to last the test of time unscathed, unlike the Quarg's own, and is in a constant need of replacement to prevent the miniature ring's integrity from being compromised. Every so often, maintenance crafts can be seen conducting repairs on some outer section of the ring.`
	planet Peripheria
		description `This enormous, kilometer-wide rotating station is the capital of the Avgi civilization in exile. Shaped like a solid disc, it is home to almost a million Avgi, made up of both civilians that were able to flee the core worlds during the invasion and those who already led independent lives in deep space.`
		description `		The station contains hundreds of levels, with centripetal gravity on the edges being the strongest. The outer rim is perpetually expanded to create more living space, and will likely continue to grow until the structural limits of the station are reached.`
		description `		The station also hosts the Assembly of Consonant Polities, a league of various nations and communities that now serves as the de-facto species-wide government.`
	planet "Phoenix Station"
		description `As with all refineries in the Deep, Phoenix Station is government-owned. You cannot imagine who would want to live here; despite reflective hull plating and active cooling systems, the station is uncomfortably hot. Nearly all the work is done by robots and computers, with only a skeleton crew of people supervising. Every time the station's orbit brings it through the planet's shadow, the temperature drops briefly and the entire station creaks ominously as it cools.`
	planet Pil
		description `This airless moon is notable only for its rich deposits of light elements such as lithium and phosphorus. Their concentration was high enough to economically justify bringing them up out of the moon's gravity well, instead of simply mining the carbonaceous asteroids present in the system.`
	planet Pilot
		description `Pilot is used as a research and testing station for Lovelace Labs. The research buildings are not open to non-employees. From a distance it looks almost like a small war is going on, with missiles being fired from a silo toward a hilltop where an anti-missile turret is picking them off one by one.`
		description `		Rumors say that the Sidewinder Missile engineering team and the Missile Defense team are in fierce competition with each other, and whichever team is currently losing to the other must buy them lunch every Friday.`
	planet Pincian
		description `Pincian is a small rocky moon, tiny enough to avoid most asteroids attracted by the nearby gas giant of Palatine. Nevertheless, a huge crater, old enough to have collected some dust and regolith, dominates its surface. Whatever crashed here, it must be tens of thousands of years since the impact.`
		description `		There are some small-scale mining operations all around Pincian, but everything around the crater has been left untouched except for a Remnant research station nestled into one of its edges.`
	planet Placatious
		description `Half a century ago, Placatious was the subject of a Syndicate marketing campaign, advertising the view of its deep blue sky from orbit to be "the most agreeable sight in the galaxy." Construction on a large station, intended to be a massive hub of conference rooms with panoramic views of the supposedly breathtaking gas giant below, was started but never completed after numerous delays and budget overruns. Eventually, the executive responsible for the entire scheme was forced into an early retirement, and the idea was quietly dropped.`
		description `		From within, Placatious really is quite beautiful, with wisps of aquamarine vapor trailing vertically as far as the eye can see. Perhaps the Syndicate would have had more success had they managed to suspend a conference room inside the gas giant's atmosphere.`
	planet Placer
		description `Placer is uninhabited aside from one small mining outpost; the atmosphere contains uncomfortable levels of ammonia and sulfur dioxide. To avoid respiratory injury from long term exposure, those who live here must wear breathing gear when they leave their pressurized homes and mine shafts.`
		description `		Several scientific experiments over the last few centuries have sought to introduce microorganisms that would break down the harmful chemicals and transform the atmosphere to make it safer for human beings to breathe, but none have been successful.`
	planet "Plort's Water"
		description `Plort's Water is an ocean world, with no landforms except for some scattered volcanic archipelagos. A few of the larger islands are home to small Arach settlements, and others live aboard "island-ships" that can each carry tens of thousands of individuals. There is very little industry here, but many of the locals are involved in biological experiments or in categorizing the millions of species that inhabit the oceans.`
	planet Poisonwood
		description `Until very recently, Poisonwood was home to a slave colony run by a powerful outlaw cartel. Tens of thousands of slaves were forced to work in hot, dirty manufacturing plants or irrigating fields out under the burning sun. Finally, in the year 2985, a Republic Navy strike force defeated the cartel and liberated the slaves. The Navy also supplied the manpower and equipment necessary to transform the factories and towns into a more livable setting for those who chose to remain, while giving others free passage off-world.`
		description `		Today, most of the inhabitants are children of the liberated slaves, and like their parents they remain grateful and fiercely loyal to the Republic.`
	planet Poseidos
		description `Poseidos is an ocean world, speckled with tiny islands. The people who live on the islands almost all make a living by fishing. The oceans are so bountiful that the locals say that only a fool or a very lazy person would starve here; there are enough fish even near shore that most families just own a small boat rather than the larger vessels designed for the deep ocean.`
		description `		The only scarce resource here is fresh drinking water. The village roofs are designed so that every drop of rain can be collected and conserved.`
	planet Prime
		description `Prime is a very Earth-like ocean world, with a population of over a billion people. It is home to Betelgeuse Shipyards, and much of the industry on the planet is related to ship-building in one way or another, like refining and working metal, or developing exotic new hull and framing materials. Although some mining is done in more remote regions of the planet, Prime is reliant on shipments of metal and other goods to feed its industries.`
	planet Pyriphlegethon
		description `Despite its poorly received name, Pyriphlegethon was famous in the early history of human interstellar travel as the first "hot Jupiter" to be explored in detail. Colorful images of its incandescent clouds and glowing night sky became some of the most iconic images of space in the 23rd century, when the invention of the hyperdrive was still recent.`
		description `		Even on the planet's night side, everything is washed in a deep red glow that seems to come from all directions at once. You are glad that gaslining technology protects your ship from the extreme temperatures outside, keeping your own atmosphere from becoming similarly incandescent to the one outside.`
	planet Qasa-Sija-Iri
		description `Though this moon is massive enough to have accrued a thin, oxygenated atmosphere, it is otherwise remarkable only for providing striking views of its parent planet's ring system. The rocky surface is slightly warm, radiating a small amount of heat generated by tidal forces from deeper inside.`
	planet Quicksilver
		description `Quicksilver is a world of highly variable, violent weather: hurricanes, hail, and earth-shaking thunderstorms. Under the planet's crust, it is equally turbulent and unpredictable, leading to frequent earthquakes and volcanic activity.`
		description `		Although Quicksilver has vast mineral resources, the tectonic activity makes underground mining far too dangerous. However, a few enterprising settlers work in surface mining and mountaintop removal. The results are ugly, but this is a far too inhospitable world for anyone to care what it looks like.`
	planet Quirinal
		description `While otherwise resembling a fairly typical moon, Quirinal is notable for the lava rifts that seem to be an inexplicably constant feature on its surface. For lack of a better description, it looks like the moon was struck a glancing blow by some sort of massive force, and the resulting chasm has been oozing lava ever since.`
		description `		Despite the astrophysical anomalies, there appears to be no current activity on the surface.`
	planet Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit
		description `This planet seems to host a larger population than any other world you have seen in Successor space. The weather is mild, and the landscape is dotted with farms both large and small, terrestrial and aquatic. On the tidal shores, massive crops of a long, stringy plant most reminiscent of seaweed grow under the care of swarms of agricultural robots.`
		description `Raaqa-Kvelq-Ryuit was the very first planet in this area of space to be colonized by the Successors' ancestors, and today it boasts a population of over five hundred million inhabitants, the largest of any world in Successor space. Its famously mild and forgiving weather supports a strong agricultural economy, and the landscape is dotted with farms both large and small. The primary export of the planet is a long, stringy plant most reminiscent of seaweed, which the Successors consider a staple and consume great quantities of.`
	planet Raaqa-Puan-Uuoru
		description `After the collapse, many Successors found themselves without a family, or without the knowledge of unbroken lineage that others took comfort in. House Kaatrij, which had lost many of its scions in the collapse, took the previously unprecedented step of welcoming these otherwise-outcasts into its familial order, earning a reputation as the most diverse of the various Houses. Many of its members still pledge a ceremonial allegiance to their defunct Houses under Kaatrij, which remains small but well-supported and a key member of the New Houses alliance.`
		description `		This, its home planet, is small, rainy, and mostly covered by ocean. Widely regarded as one of the most beautiful planets in Successor space, settlement here is tightly regulated by House Kaatrij.`
	planet Raaqa-Uur-Kaav
		description `Unlike most of the planets in this area of space, this moon remains relatively habitable. Large forests have flourished throughout it in the absence of sapient life, and the stark remains of abandoned cities are slowly being reclaimed by the nature that surrounds them. While the materials which compose the buildings have not decayed an iota over the eons, the tender shoots of green life nonetheless adhere to their twisting surfaces and flourish within their unmaintained interiors.`
		description `The one-time ancestral home of House Kaatrij is one of the few worlds of the Predecessors that remains relatively habitable. Its large forests have flourished even in the absence of Kaatrij's intentional ecoengineering, and the enduring remains of the moon's cities are slowly but surely being consumed by the nature that surrounds them. While the advanced materials composing them resist decay even on a timescale of thousands of years, the tender shoots of green life nonetheless quietly demonstrate their supremacy over the unmaintained artificial.`
		description `What was once this moon's spaceport is now a field of flowers. The landing pad upon which your ship rests has been overtaken by a host of tall blue ribbon-like blossoms, which sprout up from seams in the pavement and wave in the breeze. Nearer what once was the main body of the port, millennia-old flowerboxes are dense with spiky orange blooms that recede when touched and shed seed pods onto the empty walkways, where they are eventually snapped up by the gossamer flying creatures which perch around the whole area.`
		description `What was once this moon's spaceport is now a field of flowers. The landing pad upon which your ship rests has been overtaken by a host of tall blue ribbon-like blossoms for which the Successor name translates to something along the lines of "thread lilies." Nearer what once was the main body of the port, millennia-old flowerboxes are dense with spiky orange blooms that recede when touched and shed seed pods onto the empty walkways, where they are eventually snapped up by the wild gossamer-winged "Kijra"-pets which, like the moon as a whole, have thrived in the absence of their Predecessor masters.`
	planet Rand
		description `Rand is a desert world, too dry for much farming and with gravity low enough to be uncomfortable for most human beings. It is, however, the best source of heavy metals in the galactic south.`
		description `		Aside from the managers of the mining companies, nearly all the people here are migrant workers from elsewhere in the Dirt Belt, who have come to spend a season working for the relatively high wages that uranium mining offers, either to send money off-world or to save it up in order to build a better life for themselves.`
	planet Redias
		description `The home planet of the Incipias is ruled by powerful storms. Lightning and thunder appear without pause and a powerful wind moves the clouds at a disorienting speed.`
		description `		The Incipias have adjusted perfectly to this harsh environment. Their cities are built like them: large balloon-like structures which hold spheres of buildings in the air. The Incipias themselves can move freely through the atmosphere, so the cities have no roads. To travel larger distances, they use gliders that can fly against the powerful winds.`
	planet Redwatch
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		Despite the Hai's notably durable engineering, this station appears to have sustained substantial damage since it was abandoned. Given its proximity to Unfettered space, the station's scars are most likely a reflection of the current war taking place between the Hai and their northern brethren.`
	planet "Refuge of Belugt"
		description `Billions of Arachi live on this warm ocean world. It is home to House Debdo, one of the largest of the great Arach houses, which is composed of those who are employed in various service industries. This is a popular tourist destination not just for the Arachi, but for the Kimek as well and even a few particularly adventuresome Saryds.`
	planet "Rekat Moraski"
		description `This station is a refinery where ore from asteroids is processed into metal. Larger asteroids are processed where they are; smaller ones are brought into the refinery itself to be mined.`
	planet Relic
		description `Relic was colonized over seven hundred years ago, back when the construction of the first hyperdrive was still in living memory. At this point, most starships had a very limited range, so the stars adjacent to Earth were the only viable options for any colonization attempts. Because of this, Relic seemed like it was going to become a major colony, despite its low gravity, harsh environment, and limited resources.`
		description `		However, this would not last. In less than fifty years, the colonies had spread to much more favorable planets, and Relic was left behind by most human development.`
	planet "Remnant Wormhole"
	planet "Remote Blue"
		description `Most Kimek are proud to be members of the Coalition, but those who are either suspicious of the other species or simply want to be as far away from the Heliarch ringworlds as possible when the Quarg return with retribution, choose to live here. As a result, despite its remote location this world supports a population of over eight billion. Many of the cities have defensive gun emplacements on their outskirts, yet another sign of the local paranoia.`
	planet Retilie
		description `Retilie is an oceanic world; more than 95% of the planet's surface is covered by oceans, which can be several kilometers deep. Few traces of coastal villages are still visible, mostly composed of ancient metallic formations standing some kilometers from the seaside, where the occasional high waves can't reach them. A few small cities on the mainland are in a better state, but without anyone to maintain them, vegetation has grown to completely cover many of the surviving buildings.`
	planet Reunion
		description `Reunion is one of the most Earth-like planets found by the early settlers, all the way down to its moon and tides. It has grown into a mostly urban world, which supplies manufactured goods of all sorts to the neighboring systems.`
		description `		Local politics are unusually lively for a Republic world, to the point where a seat in the local legislature is often more hotly contested than one in the Republic Parliament. Topics of debate include trade and taxation, of course, but also seemingly fringe issues like biodiversity regulations for city green space. It may be that a world with no terraforming needs is focusing instead on tweaking society itself.`
	planet Revelation
		description `The Saryds are the only known species who successfully visited another world when their technology was still in the age of steam. The scientist who first landed here was piloting a ramshackle rocket ship of dizzying complexity. Modern analysis of his plans indicates that his flight had less than a one in ten thousand chance of success. This has led to speculation that he was either secretly assisted by friendly aliens, completely insane, or possibly both.`
	planet "Ring of Friendship"
		description `This is the crown jewel of the Heliarchs, a ringworld that was completed by the Quarg before the Coalition formed and drove them away. It now serves both as a center of finance and trade, and as the seat of the Heliarch government, which is made up of "consuls" who have been selected by the other Heliarchs from among their number in such a way that all three species always have equal representation. The Heliarchs, in turn, are selected from among the best and brightest members of each species. Despite the occasional resistance to it, this meritocracy has survived ten times longer than any human democracy.`
	planet "Ring of Power"
		description `This ringworld is the center of operations for the Heliarch defense forces. Although they have not had to fight a major space battle in thousands of years, they still maintain a sizable fleet, believing that if they ever allow their vigilance to waver, the Quarg may return and try to reclaim what was once theirs.`
	planet "Ring of Wisdom"
		description `This Heliarch ringworld is their center for science, mostly trying to understand and reverse engineer Quarg technology rather than inventing new devices of their own. But after thousands of years of controlling these ringworlds, it seems that their inner workings are still something of a mystery to the Heliarchs.`
		description `		"Construction" work is always ongoing here, but rather than extending the backbone of the ring itself, which uses exotic materials that they cannot replicate, the Heliarchs are just adding sheets of solar panels and other extensions to the sides of the ring.`
	planet Rolion
		description `At some point in the recent past, Rolion had a close encounter with another massive planet - potentially another gas giant, which was subsequently ejected from the Mellow system. Whatever the details, the encounter tipped Rolion on its side and completely upturned its atmosphere, creating wildly surging swells and storms larger than most terrestrial planets. The gravitational interaction between the two planets also heated the gas giant quite significantly, and in the infrared spectrum Rolion glows brightly.`
	planet "Rowark's Roost"
		description `Rowark's Roost was once the hideout of one of the most famous privateers of the Southern Rim, Rowark Balois. From this remote moon he became one of the largest players in drug-running and slave trading in the Rim during the early 27th century. The extensive stronghold of hangars and tunnels he built here remains to this day.`
		description `		In 2655, Rowark was flushed out of his Roost by a combined Rim and Deep fleet in a battle that continues to be studied by every aspirant Navy officer in their tutelage. As you fly over the moon you spy the wrecks of countless ships dotting its surface, but what is most striking is the truly impressive battleship-sized crater that marks the spot where Rowark met his end, doggedly choosing to fight to the very last.`
	planet Ruelogakk
		description `This Quarg station, although pristine and well-kept, has been constructed rather recently compared to the complete ringworld the next system over. It appears to be purposed as some sort of resting spot for tourists, though very few docking bays are in use. Eerily few Quarg are seen walking about the brightly lit abstract hallways of glass with only the faintest hum of machinery breaking the silence.`
	planet Ruin
		description `This is a stormy, cloud-covered planet, where fog banks flow through the valleys like dark, cold, slow-moving rivers, and the sun is seldom visible. Aside from some dull blue-gray moss and lichen, there are few living things here. The ground is warmer than the air above it, due to an abundance of radioactive elements in the planet's crust.`
		description `		Most of the surface is ocean, but atop one of the higher mountains is an odd, abandoned spaceport.`
		description `Perhaps the oddest thing about this planet is this spaceport: a ring of landing pads surrounding a collection of fuel tanks. The landing pads are not concrete or any other material humans customarily use, but monolithic slabs of basalt. One of the fuel tanks has a human-style connector on it, but there are a dozen other connectors branching off from it as well.`
		description `		A few insectoid robots scuttle slowly across the tanks and landing pads, removing ice and rust and lichen and polishing the surfaces of the tanks. No living creatures are present.`
	planet Rust
		description `Rust is smaller than Earth, but very similar in climate. Much of its surface is suitable for agriculture, with wide open grasslands and dense forests. There are very few mountains, since the planet has low levels of tectonic activity.`
		description `		The chief industry on Rust, however, are the factories and labs for Kraz Cybernetics, a maker of robots, computers, and advanced weapons systems. The planet's population is not large, but the schools are among the best in the region, and many of the inhabitants - even those who live on the farms - hold at least one advanced degree.`
	planet "Rusty Second"
		description `The combination of a dry, temperate climate and its prestigious location near the Heliarch ringworlds make Rusty Second a highly desirable home for wealthy Kimek. Nothing is cheap here, and there is very little local industry aside from the banks, shipping conglomerations, and other corporations whose senior management offices are located here.`
	planet "Sabira Eseskrai"
		description `Long ago, this planet was home to several Korath oil mining settlements, but now all that remains visible are the tops of a few dozen of the tallest buildings. Everything else has been buried by sandstorms.`
		description `		Due to a recent shift in climate the deserts have begun shrinking once more, with local vegetation growing to cover more and more land each year, but the Korath are no longer here to benefit from the change.`
	planet Saeketer
		description `This large ice giant hosts a layer in its upper atmosphere where the pressure and temperature are both close to Aviskir's at sea level. Beyond this, the gravity at this altitude is only slightly stronger than what a typical Avgi is used to, creating a paradoxically habitable area in the skies of a gas planet.`
		description `		If Saeketer was in the Anax system, it is likely some enterprising group of Avgi in the pre-hyperdrive era would have colonized its skies in aerostat habitats and floating colonies. The newly available real estate in the form of practically pristine terrestrial worlds has unfortunately devalued opportunities such as this, with there being less of a drive to colonize and exploit every body in a given star system.`
	planet "Safaresk Enlai"
		description `It is unclear what the primary purpose of this station is. The station contains numerous greenhouses where a wide variety of plants, and even some small animals, are kept. Other parts of the station are closed off to non-Korath visitors.`
	planet Sandsnap
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		A tourist FAQ in the docking area cheerily informs visitors that after the opening of the wormhole in Waypoint, Sandsnap was briefly considered as a destination for humans looking to settle in Hai space. The station would have provided ample room for millions of potential migrants without disturbing planetary ecosystems. Ultimately, it was decided that the slow trickle of human settlers did not justify the costs of bringing Sandsnap back online and that it would be better for both humans and Hai if the two species weren't sequestered from each other.`
	planet "Sandy Two"
		description `This world is relatively hot and dry by human standards, but nearly ideal for the Kimek, and more than fifteen billion of them live here in cities where the skyscrapers are so densely packed that many of the streets never receive direct sunlight. The residential areas tend to be spread out along the banks of rivers, so the cities are linear, with factories and other industry on their fringes. Access to limitless skilled labor makes it cheap to manufacture almost anything here.`
	planet "Sapira Mereti"
		description `This was the seat of government and last military stronghold of the Kor Mereti faction during the Korath civil war. Here they built the factories and shipyards that churned out autonomous warships to prosecute their war against the Kor Sestor. The machines now rule this world alone, and have made it entirely uninhabitable for living creatures as they delve ever deeper into the planet's crust to harvest metal and fuel, and construct more and more factories to build new generations of robotic warships.`
	planet Sardva
		description `The planet of Sardva is used by the Bunrodea as a vault for genetic material of all origins, from the seeds of plants that the Bunrodea have encountered to the genetic material of animals and even past generations of Bunrodeans. This material is stored in many of the planet's cave systems, which, with some slight modification, have amazingly stable climates that are perfect for the long term storage of genetic libraries.`
		description `		The decentralized and redundant nature of the vaults also ensures that if anything happens on one part of the planet that may compromise the vaults there, locations elsewhere on the planet will still keep the material safe.`
	planet "Sarisa Fentra"
		description `This planet's atmosphere has dangerously high radiation levels. On several of the continents there are patches, each nearly a hundred kilometers across, where the soil has been melted into glass by a nuclear explosion. Outside these blasted regions the plant life still flourishes, but the only land animals left alive are insects.`
		description `		In the oceans, bizarre and corrupted creatures frolic.`
	planet Saros
		description `The homeworld of the Saryds still bears some scars from the adolescence of their species, particularly in its lack of biodiversity. But over thousands of years, they have returned significant portions of the planet to their original wilderness state. The planet's population currently stands at just over two billion, in part due to the fact that Saryds live very long lives and many of them choose to dedicate their lives to serving society in other ways rather than raising children.`
	planet "Sasirka Gatru"
		description `This was probably a habitable world at one point. It is no longer. Nothing lives or grows here, and the atmosphere is full of toxic chemicals.`
	planet Saska-Aa-Noorr
		description `Though the Successors invest in few truly massive constructions, this station is one of them. Originally built over three thousand years ago as a support platform for the Predecessors' early colonization efforts, Saska-Aa-Noorr has been a consistent fixture of the star cluster and one of House Myurej's most important assets.`
		description `		In the present day it serves a primarily residential role, housing almost five million Successors in rotating cylindrical segments of its arms. The gentler gravity and tightly controlled climate these offer makes living stationside quite desirable to many Successors, but the limited space available combined with the high taxes that House Myurej levies here mean that usually only the wealthiest Successors can afford to take up residence.`
	planet "Sebarep Atarkis"
		description `Some recent event, natural or artificial, disrupted the rings around Sebarep Atarkis to the point of their complete instability. Now, hundreds of ringroids fall into the planet's atmosphere each day, tracing fiery paths in the planet's skies. This has measurably increased the temperature in the equatorial region, directly below the rings, and new storms and wind patterns are generated chaotically in the wake of their passage.`
		description `		While you know it is extraordinarily unlikely due to the sheer size of the planet, you can't help but wonder what would happen if a ringroid were to fall directly upon your ship as you lurk under the clouds.`
	planet "Sebra Skira"
		description `This is one of the primary war platforms for the Kor Sestor. Some sections of the station are much newer than others, and the scars are still visible in places where weapons fire has annihilated part of the station. The robots have rebuilt the damaged parts in a seemingly random pattern, like burls of bark growing over damaged parts of a tree.`
	planet "Second Cerulean"
		description `From above this ocean world looks like a frozen wasteland, but a wide variety of uncanny creatures inhabit the rift valleys and hydrothermal vents deep underwater. The Kimek operate a small research station on the surface, because this is one of the few worlds in Coalition territory where there are still new species left undiscovered, kilometers below the frozen surface. Above ground, only a few species of birds and insects are able to survive.`
	planet "Second Rose"
		description `Second Rose is a warm planet, but a bit too rainy for Kimek preferences. That, plus its relatively remote location, means that its population is low despite its fertile fields and fisheries: most Kimek prefer to live somewhere closer to their inner core of bustling metropolitan worlds.`
		description `		The planet's crust is rich in metal, and in some areas mine shafts have been sunk two or three kilometers below the surface to tap the richest seams.`
	planet "Second Viridian"
		description `More than ten billion Kimek live here, most of them living in one of several arcologies near the equator: massive structures that reach nearly a kilometer tall and may house over half a billion individuals. As a result, despite the large population most of the land is either undeveloped or used for farming.`
		description `		The Kimek arcologies are said to be able to recycle more than 99% of the waste produced in them each day, which is what makes it feasible for so many Kimek to live in such close proximity.`
	planet "Secret Sky"
		description `Grass and trees are scarce on this perpetually cold and foggy planet. The dominant form of vegetation is a mixture of mosses and lichens which can grow into mats more than half a meter thick. Vast herds of hoofed animals wander across the planet's surface, unable to stay in one place for long because the moss that they eat can take decades to grow back.`
		description `		The hardy plants that grow here are useful for producing a wide range of medical compounds.`
	planet "Sek Alarfarat"
		description `A hideously powerful weapon tore open scars on this planet's surface so deep that pools of magma bled out through them. Presumably these wounds were inflicted on the planet by yet another Korath super-weapon devised in the final years of their civil war. A few ruined cities remain, some of which were sliced in two by the trail of weapons fire.`
	planet Sela
		description `A former planetoid captured into Aviskir's orbit only a few hundred million years ago, Sela is unusual for large moons in that it is not tidally locked, instead having a rapid rotational period of only forty-two hours. Almost one third of the moon is covered in a glassy plain of ice, smoothed by seasonal melting and refreezing. This is thought to have been deposited by a cometary impact relatively recently, and has been steadily sublimating away into space ever since.`
		description `		An Avgi first set foot on another world here, carried by a ship driven by nuclear pulsed propulsion. Driving a ship by detonating small nuclear devices behind a pusher plate would be seen as insanity by most species, but for the Avgi it was their first stepping stone in the colonization of their home system.`
	planet "Selefkar Refinery"
		description `This station's hull is pockmarked by weapons fire and torn open by larger explosions. Only one section remains that still contains atmosphere. Inside are the corpses of a few dozen Korath, mummified by exposure to the dry and antiseptic air of the station. It's not a pretty sight.`
		description `		Before the war put an end to it, this appears to have been a refinery, processing ore harvested from the system's unusually dense population of metallic asteroids.`
	planet "Seleptra Nak"
		description `The most disturbing thing about the empty Korath cities on this planet is how pristine they are: no sign of bombing or of weapons fire. Either everyone who lived here chose to leave, or they were killed by a weapon that did no damage to the buildings they live in.`
		description `		Outside the cities, plant and animal life has begun to flourish, and some of the smaller villages have already been swallowed up by the growing forests. The climate is temperate, and rainfall is plentiful; aside from the reduction in biodiversity, it will not take this planet long to forget its former owners.`
	planet Seli'het
		description `This massive station, despite its age, does not appear to have any visible damage: everything inside it is perfectly in order, and no section shows signs of weapons fire on it. If it wasn't for the absence of its inhabitants and the complete lack of atmosphere, it would probably be identical to when it was first constructed.`
	planet "Separa Tiklar"
		description `This station manufactures the weapon systems and other equipment that is used in the Korath stations, war vessels, and world-ships.`
	planet "Septar Lorku"
		description `This system has a high concentration of metallic asteroids, which the Korath are harvesting to provide iron ore for their space ships and fissionable materials for their reactor cores. Smelting metal in a high-temperature blast furnace in the interior of a space station is, of course, an incredibly risky proposition.`
	planet Seraglio
		description `Seraglio's vast ice fields hint at a variety of mysteries, most notably the chasms that suggest the planet was somehow subjected to massive compressive forces at some point in its recent geological history.`
		description `		At present, Seraglio is the focus of considerable attention from researchers searching for clues as to the planet's history.`
	planet Serpens
		description `Serpens is a sparsely populated world of ancient canyonlands and barren deserts. There were no permanent settlements here until a century ago when visiting biologists discovered an indigenous snake whose venom is useful as a painkiller and heart medication. That led to a few small laboratories being set up in the desert, and to the eventual discovery of other useful compounds that can be extracted from the local flora and fauna.`
	planet Servian
		description `The clouds of Servian swirl in deceptive calmness around the outer limits of the planet, where automated scoop probes don't have any trouble gathering gasses and various exotic elements. Underneath the peaceful exterior, the norm is extreme turbulence and violent storms with lightning thousands of times more powerful than anything observed on nearby planets.`
		description `		While the Remnant initially sought to discover what was below the storms, they finally ceased their attempts after a lengthy exploration program involving twenty successive probes and three early puffins. Every ship was destroyed before reaching the depths of the planet, but it nonetheless proved a valuable testing ground for their early ship hulls and helped to refine the technology.`
	planet "Sessiliki Far"
		description `This is a Korath mining station, where ore extracted from asteroids is refined and processed. The Korath seem to have an aversion to harvesting raw materials from actual planets, preferring to work with lifeless asteroids instead.`
	planet "Sestor Ikfar"
		description `This dry, hot world is home to almost no native life, but is ideal for the Korath automata because of its abundant solar energy. In the places where the Korath cities once were, the Kor Sestor have built massive factories with buildings sometimes close to a kilometer in height. In other places the land remains undeveloped, but the factories are constantly expanding outward.`
	planet "Setar Fort"
		description `There are several large Korath cities on this planet, but the ones farther from the equator have been covered by encroaching glaciers as the planet slowly enters a new ice age. A small number of crops are still grown in the open air, but many of the fields have now been covered with row upon row of gleaming glass as the Korath resort to greenhouse farming to lengthen the growing season and feed their remaining population more efficiently. Farther from the city, Korath ranchers tend herds of creatures that resemble giant, six-legged yaks.`
	planet "Shadow of Leaves"
		description `Saryds are particularly drawn to forested environments, and as a result this world has become heavily populated. Rather than gathering in tightly packed cities with skyscrapers and busy roads, they have spread out evenly across the whole land area in a sort of endless suburban sprawl. But enough patches of forest have been maintained between the roads and housing compounds that from orbit, at a first glance, the planet looks pristine and uninhabited.`
	planet "Shadowed Valley"
		description `A dizzying variety of bizarre and stunted life forms have evolved on Shadowed Valley, each with different means of coping with the high levels of sulfuric acid in the planet's atmosphere and rainwater. In the mountains where cliffs and rocks are exposed to the acid rain, they have been sculpted into smooth, flowing contours etched with lines and wrinkles. But the Saryds prize this planet primarily for the beauty of its gypsum caves, full of delicate crystalline deposits, towering speleothems, and deep, clear pools of poisonous water.`
	planet Shangri-La
		description `Named after a mythical paradise, Shangri-La is an almost ideal planet, with a mixture of advanced, developed cities and uninhabited mountains. It is a rich and prosperous world, and nearly self-sufficient, but the cost of living here is prohibitively high for anyone from off-world. Because Polaris is on the very fringe of human space, and because of the wealth of its economy, piracy is a constant threat. Although recently the Syndicate has provided good protection, in past centuries it was not unheard of for raiding parties of starships to attack major port cities here, carrying off valuable cargo and sometimes also human slaves.`
	planet Shassa-Wyra-Orrou
		description `Despite its favorable location in Successor space, Shassa-Wyra-Orrou is only sparsely inhabited: the hot stars it orbits make its surface temperature a little too warm for most Successors. Even so, there are some small settlements in the polar regions, mostly populated by mining families taking advantage of the rich mineral wealth of both the planet and the surrounding system.`
	planet "Shifting Sand"
		description `This world is dry, but not particularly hot. The settlements are small and scattered, because each oasis only provides enough water for a few thousand individuals. Some of them focus on manufacturing, while others are attempting to farm the desert with drought-resistant crops. But the largest industry is retirement housing: the cool, dry climate and slow, quiet pace of life here are exactly what elderly Saryds find most comfortable.`
	planet "Shih's Locker"
		description `This gas giant earned its name after the infamous Captain Shih "disposed" of a mutiny. Rather than simply ejecting her crew out of the airlock, she packed them into an escape pod that would survive the upper atmosphere of the planet. In the years that followed, many seeking to prove themselves the meanest pirate in the galaxy sought to emulate her example by making a pilgrimage to her Locker whenever a crew member went too far out of line.`
		description `		This far within the planet's atmosphere, the sky is colored a murky blue-green, standing in contrast to the brownish haze that seems to extend for eternity. While legend on Greenrock holds that the ghosts of traitorous pirates haunt the depths of Shih's Locker, they seem to be keeping to themselves for now.`
	planet Shiver
		description `Shiver is a dead and frozen world. The only settlement is a small refueling station that services cargo fleets on their way to Earth. Precipitation is rare here, but sometimes the wind whips up snow and ice from the surface into something akin to a desert sandstorm, and even on days when the wind dies down the air sparkles with tiny, floating ice crystals.`
		description `		Most people who come here for work only stay for a few months or half a year, just long enough for the sense of adventure to die away.`
	planet Shorebreak
		description `Shorebreak is an ocean world which is home to a stunning profusion of alien life, some of which is not too dissimilar from life on Earth. The first settlement, centuries ago, was built as a marine biology laboratory, and from there the planet gradually grew into a regional center for bioengineering, where local life forms are tested for possible use in human medicine.`
		description `		Outside the laboratories, much of the planet's land mass remains in its natural state, but the planet is currently struggling with a large increase in immigration.`
	planet Shroud
		description `Shroud is a world of castles in the clouds and slums in the valleys below. High on the mountain peaks, above the clouds, the planet's few elites live in splendid mansions. Below them, the people work mostly in textiles: farming cotton, raising sheep, working at looms and sewing machines in dimly lit factories.`
		description `		The level of intrigue and dalliance between the bored gentry could easily compete with the most lurid and unrealistic of Victorian fiction.`
	planet Siedi
		description `The gravitational pull of the nearby gas giant gave rise to the large, bulky, mountainous surface of this planet. Tectonic shifts are very common, and the surface is marked with the wear and tear of massive tremors. Beneath the cracks, however, lies a rich source of materials that the Vi quickly capitalized on for their nearby worlds.`
	planet "Sies Upi"
		description `Sies Upi is one of the most recently colonized planets of the Gegno Vi. This hot, dry, and harsh world serves as more of an outpost than it does a colony, but nevertheless the Vi have found ways to create manageable living conditions for their settlers.`
	planet "Silo of Ablodab"
		description `First built by the Heliarchs mere centuries after their victory over the Quarg, this station serves as both a control point for the automated strip mines on the planet below and a smeltery to process all the raw materials brought up into the finest alloy platings. First used to produce many of the components of the two other stations in the system, the Silo now serves as a factory for spare ship parts in order to aid the local dry dock's repair functionalities when required. Within restricted sections under constant Heliarch patrol, the station features a few massive, warehouse-like rooms, where the surplus platings are stored.`
	planet Silver
		description `Eons ago, Silver was a lush tropical world. It is now mostly desert, but large oil deposits remain below the surface. The petrochemicals mined here are refined to produce plastics, fuel for terrestrial vehicles, and some components of medical ointments and antibiotics.`
		description `		The deserts are hot in daylight and surprisingly cool at night, and as a result most settlers live in houses sunk into the ground in regions where there is enough plant cover to keep the dunes from shifting in the wind and slowly burying their dwellings.`
	planet Silwan
		description `Silwan is a wet, misty world shrouded in a permanent blanket of fog, which covers the entire planet year-round. The little light that makes it to the surface reveals a bleak landscape, eroded to a nearly uniform flatness from the eons of constant rains. Only at the equator is the layer of fog burned off by sunlight, feeding humid forests of fern-like trees.`
		description `		Even less evidence of the Antecessors has survived here than usual, thanks to the rains, but this world is one of the few in this region to still host a substantial ecosystem, stubbornly clinging to life. Mossy plants and small, lizard-like scavengers are common across the entire planet, while large apex predators thrive deep in the world's oceans.`
	planet Sinter
		description `Sinter is a world where life never developed; the atmosphere is unbreathable, but warm enough and dense enough that people can survive here in pressurized homes or outside when wearing oxygen tanks. The only industry here is mining, which is mostly done with remotely controlled robots, so the population of the entire planet is only a few thousand people.`
	planet Siteria
		description `An Earth-like planet, Siteria is notable for the large number of settlements on it: every few kilometers there are remains of sizable villages, some of which still haven't been completely covered by vegetation even today. A few cities even have tall buildings still partially held together, a testament to how durable the constructions of the planet's original inhabitants were.`
	planet Skillet
		description `Skillet is a sparsely populated planet whose red hills and canyonlands are strip mined for placer deposits of iron ore and precious metals, mostly to supply the needs of the shipyards in Betelgeuse. This world is also used for ranching, and even for growing corn in a few less arid regions. The weather is usually quite mild, although hot and dry; the only reasons so few people have settled here are because it is so remote, and because the mining and farming industries need far fewer human workers than machines.`
	planet Skyfarm
		description `Due to the low gravity here, some of the alien crops planted by the Hai grow to heights of five meters or more. The air is too thin for humans or Hai to breathe without carrying supplemental oxygen tanks, so the population is very small.`
		description `		The fields are tended by enormous spider-like robots which are equipped not only for irrigation and harvesting, but also for pollination, since the thin atmosphere has made it impossible for native insects to evolve here.`
	planet Skymoot
		description `The "dragons" of Skymoot are an immensely popular tourist attraction, unlike their mythical namesakes only in their lack of ability to breathe fire. The presence of such an efficient apex predator has spurred the evolution of a stunning variety of defense mechanisms in its prey, as well; whether in the air or in the plains or deep in the forest, Skymoot is a dangerous place to visit.`
		description `		The scientific consensus is that the "dragons" are clever animals, but not sentient. Those who insist on trying to find ways to communicate with them almost invariably end up getting eaten.`
	planet Slylandro
		description `Far beneath the swirling blue surface of Slylandro's atmosphere, void sprites and other strange creatures float about. As improbable as it may seem, the void sprites must have somehow evolved the capability to manipulate gravity fields, because every once in a while one of them will rise up from the surface powered by an antigravity field similar to the landing repulsors used by human ships. When they do so, the decrease in atmospheric pressure causes them to nearly double in size.`
	planet "Smuggler's Den"
		description `Smuggler's Den was formerly known as Grendel Station, back when it was an operating refinery. But, it has since been taken over by pirates, who turned it into a haven for all manner of smugglers and privateers. As a hub of pirate activity, Smuggler's Den has access to fenced goods from beyond the region, resulting in repair shops that can make a variety of legal and illegal modifications to your ship. This confluence also provides the opportunity to buy refurbished starships... if it does not trouble your conscience to think about the likely fates of their previous owners. Rumor has it that pilots with the right connections may be able to purchase heavily modified ships here.`
	planet Snowfeather
		description `Snowfeather is a world with unusually chaotic weather patterns, where snow can fall even in the middle of summer but will melt away within days when the temperature shifts and becomes warmer again. Surprisingly, it is a popular vacation spot for the Hai, who find the unpredictability and occasional violence of the weather here to be invigorating.`
	planet Solace
		description `Solace is a fertile world that was already home to Earth-like vegetation and animals even before the first settlers arrived. It has now been inhabited for nearly half a millennium, and sprawling cities cover much of its surface.`
		description `		In addition to being one of the major metropolitan centers of the galactic South, Solace is best known as the home of Delta V Corporation, makers of plasma engines and rockets of various sorts.`
	planet "Solima Skarati"
		description `The Korath were endlessly creative in devising new weapons of war during the twilight years of their empire, but what destroyed this planet in the end was not a military disaster but an ecological one. Small villages along the ocean shores and rusting fleets of boats bear witness to the fact that this ocean world was once a fruitful fishery. But now the ocean carries high levels of industrial toxins, and in place of large fish only small invertebrates remain.`
	planet "Sopi Lefarkata"
		description `This is a cold and mountainous world, and most of its oceans are covered in ice. A handful of giant craters gouged out from the sides of mountains are the only sign that there were once Korath settlements here. But, the Kor Sestor robots have begun building settlements of their own, in caverns deep under the mountains where they are safe from orbital bombardment. Where recent Kor Mereti attacks have collapsed one of the access tunnels, swarms of robots have gathered to dig them out like ants when their hill has been stepped on.`
	planet Sopoyra
		description `Sopoyra is a major manufacturing planet, as well as the chokepoint between the Megasa systems of the north and the Erabu systems of the south. Given that royal permission is required to enter the Erabu region, this world also acts as the focal point for trade between the two regions. Goods are dropped off from other Megasa worlds, then transported to the Erabu worlds by freighters with royal permission.`
	planet "Spec Inci"
		description `This small moon seems to be used mainly as a shipment and processing base, run with the typical efficiency of the Quarg. You wouldn't have even noticed the freighters dropping off large amounts of raw ore for processing if it were not for their large size, as they are surprisingly silent when working. Other ships load the processed materials and fly away.`
	planet "Spera Anatrusk"
		description `This is a relatively dry planet, and the only Korath cities were close to the poles where the temperatures are more mild and the lifeless deserts give way to grasslands and even a few scattered forests. The largest city was clearly destroyed by orbital bombardment. The other cities seem to have been done in by rioting or looting, leaving smashed windows and burned-out buildings behind. Some of the damage is very recent; the Korath survivors here held out for a long time.`
	planet Splashdown
		description `Splashdown is an aging world where plate tectonics have long since died down and the weather has worn the surface down into lowlands, marshes, and shallow seas. Most of the land area is not suitable for growing anything but rice, and only a few settlements have been built here.`
		description `		Visitors tend to find this world boring, but the locals say they find beauty in the big sky and the subtle colors of the grasslands.`
	planet "Ssil Vida"
		description `The silence of this station rings in your ears, and as you explore you are increasingly surprised that it even has an atmosphere. It is obviously ancient, and patches of ambiguous green and purple material resembling fungus grow through the walls. Whoever built this station designed it for beings much larger than you. Either that, or they liked spacious environments. Even the shortest doorway you pass through is easily double your height. They are always wider than they are tall.`
		description `Exploring beyond the docks reveals that most of this facility is infrastructure for some type of massive emitter. It is not clear exactly what it's supposed to be emitting, but it might have something to do with how this system appeared in the first place.`
	planet Staja-Kella-Oa
		description `The easternmost planet in Successor space, Staja-Kella-Oa is mostly covered in dense forest with only a few small cities. The planet hosts at least one academy under the auspices of the noble House Sioeora. Further from your landing site, there is evidence of ongoing archaeological work.`
		description `Staja-Kella-Oa is widely recognized as the location of the best educational institutions in Successor space, most of which are funded by the Old Houses but accept applications from all Successors regardless of birthplace or family history.`
		description `		The planet itself is densely forested with a few small cities. Part of the reason that it continues to be a center for education is that it has a rich archaeological history: this planet was home to a now presumed-extinct sapient species roughly one hundred thousand years ago, and there is a great deal of interest in uncovering the details of their society.`
	planet Starcross
		description `Starcross is a stormy, ocean-dappled planet that was not settled until the planets farther out on this arm of the galaxy grew prosperous enough to create a need for a stop-over point for cargo. Structures must be built strong and on high enough ground to avoid the frequent floods.`
		description `		A few enterprising settlers have taken up farming of some native plants that are edible for humans, including one plant similar to cranberries that has come to be considered a rare delicacy by many.`
	planet "Starting Rubin"
		description `Starting Rubin was far from being the first station constructed around the Kimek homeworld, but it is the oldest one to still be in orbit. It was built as an orbital equivalent to the hunger towers found on the planet it orbits, as a safety measure against the disasters that may affect Ki Patek Ka.`
		description `		Since the residents need little of the food produced, it quickly became the station's primary export, transforming it into one of the largest trading hubs of the region. It has also the largest population of any Coalition station, capable of supporting tens of thousands of Kimek.`
	planet "Station Cian"
		description `Cian Station orbits a large gas giant, which simultaneously has compounds usable in hyperspace fuel and enough mass to pull an abnormally large numbers of asteroids near it. The local industry mostly centers around the metals harvested here, but part of it is still focused on refining deuterium. Its remote location prevents it from becoming a major port, but most traders that travel into this region stop here, even if just to refuel and to watch its impressive facilities. This is also the most recent Coalition station, although it's much older than any in human space.`
	planet Steamwater
		description `Steamwater is a hot Neptune, a misleadingly named "ice giant" close to its parent star. Steamwater is distinctive in that, by mass, it is almost entirely water. Beyond this, the range of temperatures and pressures found in its atmosphere is such that its thickest layer is composed of supercritical water, a phase state blending together the states of vapor and liquid, making flight inside it rather disorienting.`
		description `		With no true interface between gaseous water vapor and the compressed liquid found below, the buoyant force affecting your ship is unpredictable without keeping a careful eye on your inertial altimeter. While this is true of gas giants in general, the much higher density of water as compared to common hydrogen makes this effect especially noticeable.`
	planet Steli
		description `The small tectonic plates on Steli move especially slowly, as though they are almost locked in place. Most of the mountain ranges here are eroded, worn down by time and the moon's extensive hydrosphere, which lends it a cool, temperate climate.`
		description `		Frequent hot spots trickle lava and heat through the otherwise lethargic crust, and Steli has one of the highest counts of hot springs in all the habitable planets of the Twilight. Only its distance from the core of Avgi space precluded its widespread settlement, though it is rumored that hidden villages and nomadic groups live scattered across the surface.`
	planet Stilacrest
		description `Stilacrest is a warm world, with its shallow freshwater seas, pleasant weather, and white limestone cliffs making it an ideal vacation world to any human. The mountain-born Avgi, however, were rather discomforted by its relatively flat landscape and sluggish winds, and permanent settlement has been sparse.`
		description `		The oceans are rich in appetizing sea life, and Stilacrest is home to an abundance of independent fishing boats run by those seeking to build a new life away from the homeworld. The lure of the calm waves and mild weather is said to have attracted a meditative, laid-back sort of personality.`
	planet Stonebreak
		description `Stonebreak is home to some of the largest cities in Hai space aside from their homeworld: massive planned communities built in concentric rings, where housing space and community buildings alternate with zones of factories and shipyards. This star system has an unusual number of metallic asteroids, which the Hai harvest for the raw materials for Stonebreak's industries.`
	planet Stormhold
		description `Stormhold is a cold planet, with a dense, foggy atmosphere. As with many pirate outposts, Stormhold is home to an unknown number of villages and hidden outposts, each controlled by a different pirate faction. It is also said that some of the most dangerous fugitives in the galaxy live deep in the forests of this planet, escaping detection by living underground or by avoiding the use of electronic devices.`
	planet "Stronghold of Flugbu"
		description `The Stronghold of Flugbu was used as a military base during the War of Independence. Now it is a manufacturing world, specializing not in large machines but small, intricate components. It is also home to House Bebliss, the secretive guild that specializes in communication, translation, and encryption. House Bebliss is essential to the Coalition economy because they maintain the hyperspace communication network, but there are also rumors that they may have ties to the Lunarium.`
	planet "Successor Wormhole"
	planet Sundive
		description `Sundive is largely covered in tropical rainforests and savanna, but with enough open plains that it has also become a major agricultural world. For most of the year, the weather here is quite mild, but tornadoes and massive thunderstorms are not uncommon in the summer months.`
		description `		Sundive is also home to a number of research facilities which study the data gathered from the astronomical laboratory on its moon, Taylor.`
	planet Sundrinker
		description `Most of this world is barren deserts and oceans; for whatever reason almost no life evolved here. The only human settlement is a small town in one of the few hilly regions, and the locals survive by ranching and farming. It is the sort of world that is ideal for people who enjoy being alone, because it has almost no appeal for anyone else. In addition to the oppressively hot weather, flash floods are quite frequent.`
	planet Sunracer
		description `Sunracer is home of Megaparsec, Inc., a shipyard that specializes in designing fast, lightweight ships.`
		description `		It is a well-settled planet with a population of over a billion, and a diverse economy that includes farming and fishing in addition to the shipyards.`
		description `		Outside the cities, large regions of undeveloped land still remain. Hovercraft racing is a major local sport, and some massive and elaborate courses have been constructed in the wilderness.`
	planet Swiftsong
		description `Swiftsong Station is operated and maintained by the Imo Blep corporation as a giant convention center. Most Hai stations restrict access beyond the docking bay or the promenade to at least some degree, but Swiftsong is almost completely open.`
		description `		Tens of thousands of Hai pass through on an almost daily basis as the continual churn of summits, forums, conventions, symposiums, productions, conferences, weddings, festivals, and the like roll on in an endless cavalcade of life. With Icelake nearby and Hai-home just one jump away, this station is a major cultural hub that even houses the head office of one of the biggest music labels in Hai space.`
	planet Taylor
		description `Taylor is home to a large astronomical laboratory, with radio telescopes and other devices for studying the galactic core and the massive black hole that resides there. Because of the laboratory, Taylor has strict landing protocols that ensure your ship doesn't cross the path of the telescopes at any time.`
		description `		On the other side of the moon the Syndicate has established a substantial military base, as a guard against the pirates in nearby Alcyone.`
		description `		If you need to repair or refuel in this system, you will need to visit Sundive instead of this moon, as the military base is not open to ships that aren't affiliated with the Syndicate, and the laboratory's small spaceport does not have the facilities to service ships.`
	planet "Tebuteb's Table"
		description `This world is home to House Garbarag, the Arachi guild of farmers and ranchers. On private ranches far from the cities, they experiment with raising new breeds of longcows, a unique species of cattle that grow a new body segment each year and can reach more than thirty meters in length. The meat from a single longcow can feed a village for a month.`
		description `		Longcows are typically docile and slow-moving, but when frightened one of them can do as much damage as an entire herd of stampeding terrestrial cattle.`
	planet "Tefkar Ret"
		description `This station is run-down and completely abandoned, emptied of atmosphere so that air pressure will not put ongoing stress on the station's structure. Each section is sealed off from the others by heavy blast doors, leaving most of the station inaccessible.`
	planet Ternituul
		description `Ternituul is a dull world covered in a thick layer of fog hiding a dry desolate surface: an ideal world for the hardened Gegno Vi. A large portion of the Vi's military branch is based here, where new recruits are thrown into the first bottleneck of their lives. It is not uncommon for inhabitants to be lost to the bleak ecosystem of this planet.`
		description `		The fog also hides a more grim aspect of this world - numerous graveyards cover the terrain, serving as a final resting place for most Vi. Large ceremonies are constantly held for the fallen, though instead of showing grief, the Vi celebrate the commitment and dignity of their departed brethren.`
	planet Thilos
		description `The Avgi were fortunate to have this nearly habitable planet in their home system. Covered in a thick crust of ice, a deep subsurface ocean lies just below the surface, heated by the radioactive decay of isotopes in its rocky core.`
		description `		This planet was the first to be settled by the Avgi, who almost immediately began thickening its atmosphere, oxygenating it, and warming the surface with orbital mirrors. Despite beginning this process nearly three centuries ago, it will likely be another century before Thilos becomes warm enough to live on, though its atmosphere is already breathable.`
	planet "Third Umber"
		description `This cool, dry world is a sort of natural cleanroom, an ideal place for manufacturing sensitive equipment that could be harmed by the presence of condensation or mildew or pollen granules. The factory workers and overseers live in hive-like dormitories that each house tens of thousands of Kimek.`
		description `		Closer to the poles, the air is too cold to be comfortable for the Kimek, but a small community of Saryd engineers has established a factory compound where they produce their own equipment to sell to the Kimek.`
	planet Thornlight
		description `A visitor to this station will immediately notice that the gravity is lower than most planets by about a third. The reception area is lavish with several artworks and exotic plants. A well-groomed Hai receptionist informs you that, unless you have family at this respite facility, you will not be permitted to wander the station.`
		description `The spaceport is small but serviceable, featuring a luxuriously appointed Centipede parked in a berth, presumably for entertainment voyages. There is a small but fancy cafe, and a gift shop with gold watches, jewelry, wines, and other pricey trinkets. This place must provide aged care services for only the very wealthy.`
	planet Thrall
		description `Thrall has a warm, moderate climate and a geography of mostly gently rolling hills. Most of the industry here takes the form of agriculture, especially growing cotton, which mills in the three major cities process into textiles for export off-world.`
		description `		This is one of the few places in the galaxy where cotton is picked by hand, because labor here is cheaper than the cost of buying and maintaining machinery. The locals are prevented from seeking more lucrative employment elsewhere partly by the crushingly low wages, which make the cost of space transport prohibitively high for most, and partly by the educational system, which is among the worst in the galaxy.`
	planet Thshybothro
		description `Thshybothro is a small, mountainous world that is home to the Bunrodea's largest cybernetics research facilities. Various labs and factories are scattered within the world's many valleys, within which the Bunrodea work to develop new cybernetics, or improve their old ones.`
		description `		Although this planet is where new modifications are developed, the mass production and installation of cybernetics is typically done elsewhere.`
	planet Thule
		description `Thule is a mountainous world with a population of nearly a billion, settled in the early days of space exploration. When the colony was first established, the Earth government did not yet have the strength to control any system but its own. As such, Thule refused to join the Republic when it was formed, and has since repulsed all efforts to force it to do so. It is well-known that the planet sponsors pirate fleets which bring it cheap materials to bolster its economy, but the planet is so far from the center of Republic space that fighting a war here would be prohibitively expensive, and so they remain unopposed.`
	planet Thunder
		description `When the first colonists landed, they thought that they had found a dream world on Thunder: perfect gravity, perfect temperature, perfect atmosphere. Unfortunately, they soon discovered that the planet has unusually high tectonic activity, enough that building anything higher than two stories is almost impossible. Because of the earthquakes, attracting settlers has always been difficult for Thunder, and right now the population is only a few million.`
	planet Tibernia
		description `Tibernia is a classic ice planet, but unlike most, it is nearly a perfect sphere with a remarkably smooth surface blemished by few craters. Many have speculated that it is artificial, but so far no one has found conclusive evidence of this.`
	planet "Tik Klai"
		description `This world is uncomfortably hot, even for the Wanderers, and so close to its star that the surface is bathed in dangerous levels of ultraviolet light. The few Wanderer installations here are buried underground, with only a few access hatches and storage buildings on the surface.`
	planet Tinker
		description `Tinker is a highly industrialized world, exporting electronics both to the Syndicate and to Earth. The electronic goods manufactured here span the gamut from wires and capacitors to sophisticated microchips, and because many of the jobs here require skilled labor, it is a relatively prosperous planet.`
		description `		Outside the cities, large areas of this world have been set aside for mining and for refineries and smelters, ensuring that the industries here have all the raw materials they need, plus extra to sell.`
	planet Topkapi
		description `Much like Aksaray, Topkapi is an old moon formed from the smashed remains of countless eons worth of stellar debris. The surface appears to be regularly bombarded by asteroids, although some of the craters show signs of being the site of rather large explosions. Your sensors pick up traces of materials most commonly found in Korath ships.`
		description `		Topkapi does not appear to have any routine activity, although satellites in orbit indicate that the Remnant monitor it for activity and send ships to investigate asteroid or other impacts on a regular basis.`
	planet Treser
		description `A dark world lies beneath you. Some chemical compound in the clouds is absorbing over ninety percent of the light that hits this planet, resulting in an enormous amount of heat in the gas giant's atmosphere. The extreme temperatures are so taxing on your ship that you are barely able to fly through the uppermost layers. When the heat exceeds a certain point the gas becomes plasma, creating small spots of light on this world of eternal darkness.`
	planet Trinket
		description `In a region of the galaxy not known for beach resorts, Trinket has become somewhat of a major tourist destination. It is not a particularly warm world, and near both poles icebergs float year round, but at the equator the weather is almost tropical and the water is warm enough for swimming.`
		description `		Occasionally one of the ocean currents will pick up an iceberg and carry it all the way down past the resorts before it melts completely. Taking a boat out to these icebergs is a popular daytime activity here.`
	planet "Triton Station"
		description `Triton Station serves both as a refinery for hyperspace fuel, and as a garrison for ships of the Republic Navy. Patrol ships are constantly landing here and then taking off to scour the surrounding systems for pirates. Since pirates are scarce in this part of space, it seems like a very tedious job.`
	planet Trove
		description `Trove is a tiny world, too small to have a breathable atmosphere. It is home to an experimental "jack mining" operation that has split its surface open in order to gain access to the metal-rich core.`
		description `		Most of the work here is done by machines, but a few people live inside an airtight complex in order to supervise the work and to sell ore and metal to visiting ships.`
	planet Truklar
		description `This world, like others the Quarg live on, has noticeably lower gravity than humans are accustomed to. Several medium-sized extravagant villages are found nested deep within an oddly shaped glass structure, and it is a beautiful sight to behold. Many different, smaller biomes also contain wondrous flora and fauna that don't seem to be native to this particular moon. Despite all of this, structures were not built to accommodate visitors such as the nearby aliens, who find it hard to navigate the narrow hallways.`
	planet Tschyss
		description `This massive station is the only orbital structure that can be found in Gegno space, and is still under heavy construction. Although a majority of the exterior seems complete, the interior is noticeably lacking in comparison, and it seems that the progress has slowed down significantly in recent times. A large portion of the station is filled with crew quarters and living sections, all more expansive than those in human space, and the outside is enveloped in many docking bays of various sizes.`
	planet Tundra
		description `Millions of years ago, this was a warm world, perhaps even tropical. But some cataclysmic event, perhaps a meteor strike or a massive volcanic eruption, altered the planet's atmosphere enough to turn it into the nearly lifeless, frozen planet it is today.`
		description `		The first settlers came here to drill for the oil trapped deep under the surface, a relic of Tundra's former, more lively days. Instead of refining the oil into plastic, which sells relatively cheap in this region, they have developed an industry in synthetic fabrics and clothing.`
	planet "Turquoise Four"
		description `The offshore kelp farms on Turquoise Four produce not only nutritional food, but also an ultra-strong fiber that is used for creating durable textiles. Farther from shore, the Kimek operate fish farms as well. Viewed from above, the ocean surface is divided into patches of deep blue or green or rusty brown depending on what sort of product is being farmed in each patch.`
	planet Turra
		description `Turra's thick atmosphere makes this gas giant a dark world. From time to time the wall of haze gets broken and a ray of light reveals giant caverns of air within the clouds. The local lifeforms are primitive and mostly plantlike; some of them look like dark flowers, absorbing the little light that shines on them.`
	planet Tuur-Aasa-Kaska
		description `As it was only very recently settled by the Successors, this large and rocky moon supports only a small population, most of whom are military personnel for the Old Houses and who live underground to avoid the powerful electrical storms on the surface. Though an undeniably hostile and uncomfortable place, the location of its star system has made it an ideal staging point for the fleets of the Old Houses to keep an eye on trade in nearby systems, and the persistent electrical storms on the surface serve to mask the energy signatures of their vessels.`
	planet Tuur-Oa-Sola
		description `The atmosphere of this moon is thin but toxic, and its surface is riddled with fissures that spew hot gases kilometers up into space. It appears to be falling below the Roche limit of the gas giant it orbits, and will probably be torn apart into a ring system within a few thousand years.`
	planet Twinstar
		description `The only settlement on this small world is Twinstar Depot, a village created mostly just to service the spaceport, where food and equipment from the southern galactic arm is stored and sent out in all directions to supply the rest of human space.`
		description `		The gravity is far less than ideal for human development, but the atmosphere is breathable and some tourists come to the planet just for the experience of being able to run and jump in low gravity without the need for a suit or oxygen tanks.`
	planet "Typhon Station"
		description `Typhon Station is one of the major fuel refining stations in the galactic Rim. It is privately owned by Southbound Shipyards, and all the fuel produced here is shipped directly to them rather than being made available to visiting ships.`
	planet Uo-Oraa-Vayya
		description `This small planet is in the midst of an ice age, and nearly its entire surface is covered in ice sheets several kilometers thick. There are next to no permanent inhabitants, but the Successors maintain a significant research presence here to study the planet's unique conditions.`
		description `		It is rumored that the navies of the New Houses will send recruits on missions here to test their fortitude, though that is unequivocally denied by official sources.`
	planet Uryyhr
		description `Uryyhr is a dense gas giant whose skies are choked with tholins, reddish organic compounds found in the outer reaches of many star systems. These largely come from the planet's rings, which are in the last stages of a decaying orbit that deposits them in broad bands across Uryyhr's surface.`
		description `		Deep beneath the cloud layer, strong updrafts keep most of the tholins circulating in the atmosphere. It is likely that the planet will be tinged by their color for millions of years to come.`
	planet "Ut Divitas"
		description `The surface here is bare, and there is no sign of life to be seen anywhere. A few lonely but giant cities sprawl like flowers on the surface of the moon, and the architecture is abstract, elegant, and unlike anything humans have ever built.`
	planet Uuoru-Veldt-Stir
		description `The landscape on this planet is marked by gently rolling hills and the occasional pond. Your sensors remark that the atmosphere outside, while oxygen-rich, is too thin to safely breathe, and while you see a preponderance of hardy plant life, there are no animals to be seen.`
	planet "Uye Mpi"
		description `Spanning lands of dust and bulky rock formations make up a majority of this world's details. However, unlike many other desert worlds, there are many basins of spring water and surprisingly calm weather patterns. The clear blue skies and tame wildlife commonly found on the planet give it a sense of serenity and beauty.`
		description `		Nearby conflict between the warring Gegno factions often results in engagements within this system, though neither group has yet to commit to any large-scale foundation on the surface of this planet. A majority of skirmishes either occur in orbit above or follow the Gegno to neighboring systems.`
	planet Vade-Osolaa-Kaska
		description `This station appears abandoned; it is old and decaying, and while the automated systems maintain a breathable atmosphere in some areas, there are no signs of permanent habitation.`
		description `Although briefly used as a small-scale shipyard several hundred years ago, this station was eventually abandoned by the High Houses because of its inconvenient location and altogether poor construction. There are occasional rumors about criminals using it as a bolt-hole or a place to hide contraband, but few among the Successors have the desire to go and check.`
		description `The spaceport here is cavernous but empty, riddled with voids where vast pieces of machinery have been removed. A layer of dust covers the ground; it is disturbed in some locations with what look like trails, suggesting that this place may not be entirely unused.`
	planet Vail
		description `Vail is an entire world that is maintained as a ski resort for rich clients from the nearby planets. A combination of terraforming and snow making ensures that whichever hemisphere is in winter always has ideal skiing conditions, while farming and other small industries supply the tourists and the large staffs that cater to them.`
		description `		The slopes here include tracks for all the latest dangerous and expensive extreme winter sports, like hoverboarding and wingsuit cliff skiing.`
	planet Valhalla
		description `Valhalla was the first world to be settled in this region of space, which is known as the Deep. It is rich in natural resources, but all its vast farms and fisheries are insufficient to feed its population of over five billion.`
		description `		The shipyards of Lionheart Industries are located here. Centuries ago, warships built here turned the tide of the Alpha War, and today the ships designed and built in the Deep continue to be some of the most technologically advanced ships in human space - and the most expensive.`
	planet "Valley of the Damned"
		description `From afar, this looks like a habitable planet, comfortably located on the near end of the goldilocks zone of its star. It has a high concentration of water vapor in its atmosphere and hosts primitive life, with mosses covering nearly all moist surfaces and exotic crustacean-like animals roaming the land, their carapaces made of what would be considered synthetic plastic elsewhere.`
		description `		However, there is an unusually high concentration of toxic chlorine in the lower atmosphere. Without special equipment, one can only stay on the mountains to avoid the dense gas, and even then, only for a few hours before problems arise. Most traces of attempted colonization by the Sheragi have eroded away by now, leaving only broken buildings and decaying bones.`
	planet Vanikos
		description `A young, primordial world, Vanikos is a cold and watery moon still newly formed, with freshwater oceans dominated by strong tides and volcanism. Hydrothermal vents, fueled by the powerful tidal forces acting on the moon, bleed warmth into what are otherwise frigid seas. Life has yet to develop around these temperate islands of heat, but the abundance of water and organic compounds means it is only a matter of time before it takes hold.`
		description `		Of course, with Avgi exploration having taken note of Vanikos years ago for its liquid water and relatively hospitable temperatures, life may first emerge here as a result of eventual terraforming efforts before it can naturally evolve.`
	planet "Var Oti"
		description `This rocky world is covered with vast ranges of desert. While some places have plateaus of rugged rock formations, others have articulate valleys of sand. When it comes to less distinct locations, it is hard to tell at first glance whether or not they are simply a formation of rocks resting on a deep layer of sand, or a thin layer of sand resting on a great foundation of rock. In addition, common dust storms constantly reshape the terrain, and together with the harsh, dry conditions, make Var Oti a dangerous world to visitors who are ill-prepared.`
	planet "Var' Kar'i'i"
		description `This is a populous Wanderer world, with small farming villages scattered across all the land, and even a few larger population centers that might almost qualify as a city. But from the air, it is not evident at first that the planet is so heavily settled, because the village tree-houses are mostly hidden beneath the forest canopies. The farms, too, are almost indistinguishable from natural land, due to a permaculture system where many varieties of plants are growing side by side.`
	planet "Var' Kayi"
		description `This is an Earth-like world with one major Wanderer city and countless smaller settlements. The settlements mostly consist of tree-houses built high up in living trees. The architecture of the city skyscrapers is full of cantilevered balconies and arches, mimicking the natural shape of a forest. Here and there a bit of smoke or steam rises from what must be a factory or power plant, but most of the land outside the city is green fields and pristine oceans.`
	planet "Var' Roi"
		description `The surface of this small icy moon is constantly cracked and broken by tidal force from the gas giant that it orbits. The tidal disturbances also heat the moon enough to keep its oceans warm enough to support life despite the small amount of sunlight that reaches here.`
	planet "Vara K'chrai"
		description `This is the most populous Wanderer world, with dozens of large cities. The tallest buildings branch and cantilever out from their bases like metallic trees. More than half the surface of the planet is ocean, with a few small settlements built on massive living rafts of algae and seaweed, perhaps ten meters thick and up to several kilometers wide. Much of the land is forests, with villages built entirely in the treetops.`
		description `		There are also farms here, but more like gardens or parks than a human farm: each with dozens of species of plants growing side by side, and harvested by autonomous robots.`
		description `The streets in the Wanderer capital city seem to be mostly reserved for cargo vehicles; the Wanderers themselves fly from one building to another instead, and the skyscrapers have balconies dozens of stories above the ground where visitors can land or take off. The air traffic seems utterly chaotic, but somehow they avoid colliding with each other in midair, and certain columns of airspace have been reserved for ships taking off and landing so that flying Wanderers will not get caught in the backwash from the ship engines.`
	planet "Vara Ke'sok"
		description `The surface of this world is almost entirely ocean, and the Wanderers who inhabit it live on massive floating algae mats, some of them the size of a small city. Engines are attached to some of these floating villages, allowing them to be slowly propelled from one part of the planet's surface to another, and the only native industries are fishing and seaweed farming.`
	planet "Vara Ke'stai"
		description `This is a desert world, but the Wanderers are working little by little to make the desert bloom: planting hardy shrubs and cacti that eventually transform the sand into a soil that can hold moisture. In some regions, especially closer to the poles, the deserts have given way to dense forests, but near the equator there are still large stretches of dry and barren sand, broken by the occasional belt of green where a narrow river winds between the dunes.`
	planet "Vara Kehi'ki"
		description `This is a farming world, but the primary crops are medicinal plants rather than food: fields of brightly colored flowers and delicate shrubs. Large factories near the farms process the raw plants and extract useful chemical compounds. Their gleaming metal smokestacks belching steam into the air seem incongruous amid the natural beauty and bright colors of the fields of flowers.`
	planet "Vara Pug"
		description `Vara Pug is an ocean world, wild and almost unsettled, except for a single Pug city on the coast of one of the major continents. The animals and plants on the land are relatively uninteresting, but the oceans are home to an enormous variety of creatures, including whales the size of a Bulk Freighter, a highly intelligent species of jellyfish, and other, far stranger creatures that rarely venture up from the sunless ocean depths.`
		description `		To avoid contact with these marine creatures, when the Pug travel to other parts of the planet they use massive solar-powered airships rather than boats.`
	planet "Vara Rakak"
		description `This is one of those rare worlds whose climate is already nearly perfect without the need for terraforming. The Wanderers have made it into a farming planet. The fields follow the natural contours and geology of the land rather than being laid out in rectangular lots like most human farms, and each field contains several different crop species designed to form a symbiotic ecosystem.`
	planet "Varu Ek'lak'lai"
		description `The Wanderers harvest metal ores not from planets, but from asteroids, in order to not expend even more of the resources of the planets that are under their care. This star system contains an unusually high concentration of metallic asteroids, and as a result they have built many large refineries here to process the ore that their drones harvest.`
	planet "Varu K'est"
		description `Varu K'est is a spare, ancient planet of arid plateaus and deep, meandering canyons, with too little rainfall to support any but the hardiest of shrubs. The Wanderers have converted nearly all their villages on this planet into military bases in order to oppose the encroaching Hai raiders, and have also been forced to postpone their attempts at improving the local ecology.`
	planet "Varu K'prai"
		description `This is one of the only Wanderer worlds that still has large reserves of oil, albeit deep below the ocean surface where mining is difficult. Aside from the drilling companies and refineries, the largest local employer is the local government's safety oversight department, whose inspectors are constantly visiting the drilling platforms and shipping hubs to ensure that all the regulations for preventing oil spills are being followed.`
	planet "Varu Mer'ek"
		description `This Wanderer factory world is now home to more abandoned villages than populated ones: entire factories rusting and decaying as a result of the recent threat from the Unfettered Hai. Most of the factories that remain active have been repurposed to produce weapons or ammunition for the defense of Wanderer space.`
	planet "Varu Tek'kai"
		description `This Wanderer world is almost uninhabited and devoid of any indigenous ecosystem, except perhaps on the microscopic level. It has none of the beauty of other Wanderer settlements. Here, factories have been built to process the most dangerous and destructive of industrial chemicals. If disaster strikes one of the factories, the only result will be the contamination of a world that is already dead and lifeless - far better, in the judgment of the Wanderers, than allowing such risky industries to operate on a living world.`
	planet "Varu Tev'kei"
		description `This is a desert world, too hot and too close to its sun to support much animal or plant life. The Wanderers have covered large stretches of the desert with solar-powered factories: smelters that use the sun's reflected heat to melt ore, and fields of solar panels that support other industries.`
	planet Vatican
		description `Vatican's propensity for constant renewal of the surface has resulted in a flourishing astrogeological academic program. While it has frequently been dismissed as a low priority for Remnant efforts, it has nonetheless received continued support from the defense prefects. Why they would be concerned with the geological formations of an uninhabited planet is unknown, but the research continues.`
	planet Veiuye
		description `Like the other moons of the nearby gas giant, Veiuye is a frozen world. However, the surface layer of Veiyue is rather thin, and more detailed scans show large, hollow caverns beneath the exterior of the moon. These areas are abnormally warm compared to the rest of the moon and appear to be filled with oceans primarily made up of water. Strange readings come from these areas, which could possibly be due to microbial life.`
	planet Veliante
		description `Veliante may have been habitable once, but no longer. Part of its southern hemisphere is filled with deadly levels of radiation, but even elsewhere on the planet, it isn't safe to remain on the surface without adequate protection for too long. While animal life on the planet seems to have disappeared almost completely, plants and trees cover the surface in vast, colorful patches of flora.`
	planet "Vibrant Water"
		description `Due to strong currents and extreme seasonal temperature fluctuations, the oceans of Vibrant Water are dotted with icebergs that can drift almost as far as the tropics before melting. The largest icebergs are more than a dozen kilometers across and are home to entire ecosystems ranging from ice-dwelling insects to sea birds to large seal-like mammals. Beneath the ocean surface shoals of fish, forests of kelp, and drifting clouds of algae provide a continuous food source for the creatures that inhabit the icebergs.`
		description `		Near the equator, the Saryds farm several species of engineered algae.`
	planet Vigales
		description `This hot desert world is home to several species of underground animals. These creatures are very reptile-like, having appearances similar to those of lizards or salamanders from Earth, although much larger in size. It is believed that some indigenous species common across Gegno space originated from this world, or are descendants of ancestral species that once inhabited it.`
	planet Viminal
		description `This cold and dreary world would certainly not be attractive to any modern settlers, but to those who were fleeing the chaos of the Alpha Wars it had the undeniable advantage of being isolated and undiscovered. The continued Remnant presence here is due to the planet's Key Stones, which enable ships to travel through certain wormholes in the Ember Waste, and which the Remnant have not found on any other planet.`
	planet Vinci
		description `Many centuries ago, some of the first settlers on Vinci included a small group of electrical engineers who formed a revolutionary new company for designing computers and microchips. Today, Vinci is the foremost manufacturer of CPUs in all of human space, and their processors are found in everything from navigational computers to video phones to intelligent toasters.`
		description `		Because this world is home to so many cleanroom fabrication plants, pollution is very tightly controlled.`
	planet Violetwake
		description `This station was mothballed sometime in the last sixty thousand years. The docking area has an atmosphere, and a status panel indicates that the station's generators are functional but shut down, with standby mechanisms running on solar power alone.`
		description `		The sheer size of this station is striking. Millions of Hai must have been housed here in Violetwake's heyday, which makes the lonely, isolated atmosphere here all the more jarring. The darkened corridors of the station remind one of an immense cave whose insides have still not been entirely mapped.`
	planet Viso
		description `A world of ice and ammonia, Viso is home to a curious ecosystem of ammonia-breathing bacteria, deep red algae, and small, cold amphibians. The planet's proximity to its host star, a red dwarf, amplifies the interactions between the solar wind and Viso's magnetic field, producing auroras that often reach the equator.`
		description `		Scientific interest aside, the Avgi's interactions with Viso have been limited to harvesting the ammonia for use in fertilizer production, often being interrupted by Aberrant raids.`
	planet "Vivid Aether"
		description `Whether it be from local evolution or panspermia, Vivid Aether's clouds are home to colonies of anaerobic microbial life, feeding on both sunlight and traces of methane in the atmosphere. These form colorful streaks in the upper atmosphere, which were what initially attracted Saryd explorers to the planet. Now, it is common for Heliarch research patrols to sit in orbit for weeks at a time in order to study the simple, yet exotic, ecology. Occasionally, they send down small vessels capable of withstanding the extreme pressures, though none happen to be nearby right now.`
		description `		The life-bearing layer only extends downward a few hundred kilometers before pressures rise and the temperature becomes inhospitable to life. Deeper down, the atmosphere is barren and lifeless.`
	planet Vulpa
		description `At first sight this planet looks fairly hospitable for a gas giant. The blue tones suggest an ocean world, but looks can be deceiving; its clouds contain countless small glass droplets moving at tremendous speeds, cutting through everything in their way. Your spaceship's hull is able to deflect most of them, but it is advisable not to stay here for too long.`
	planet Vyraa-Giiq-Sora
		description `It's not clear why this planet remains uninhabited, as it possesses a breathable atmosphere and temperate climate; the surface is covered in indigenous lifeforms, many of which exhibit some degree of bioluminescence.`
		description `Despite the verdant and often bioluminescent life on its surface, the atmosphere of this planet is highly toxic to the Successors' biochemistry, and so they have made no permanent settlements here. While it is occasionally visited by the odd few tourists who don't mind having to wear an isolation suit, its distance from the majority of Successor space means that the Successors largely leave it alone.`
	planet Vyraa-Viir-Kella
		description `This planet has a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a cool and watery surface with many large lakes. There appear to be no sites of permanent habitation, though a couple of landing pads and associated temporary shelters have been built on islands in the southern hemisphere.`
		description `This planet is being surveyed to establish its potential as a new settlement location for the New Houses. Although its gravity is somewhat high for Successor tastes, it has a clear, oxygen-rich atmosphere, and a cool and watery surface. The first groups of settlers are scheduled to arrive here in a few years, once the planetary surveys are complete and have declared it safe and geologically stable.`
	planet Warfeed
		description `Warfeed is mostly covered in oceans, and much of its land area devoted to agriculture. Most of the fields are tilled and harvested by robots, but there are also many scattered homesteads of subsistence farmers, who survive with the aid of little or no technology.`
		description `		In recent years, both the land and the seas of Warfeed have begun to show the toll of centuries of overharvesting. Large portions of the continents near the equator are now nothing but growing deserts, and even the best remaining farmland is sandy and nutrient-poor. All but the smallest marine organisms have been nearly fished to extinction.`
	planet "Warm Slope"
		description `This is an ideal world, by Saryd standards: rugged, hilly, mostly forested, with oceans and land masses in equal proportions. It serves mostly as a residential world, because this system's heavy industry is focused on the automated factories on its sister world of Ceaseless Toil.`
	planet "Warm Wind"
		description `The tropical rainforests of Warm Wind are unusual: instead of rivers on the surface, water flows through intricate underground networks of caves that span entire continents. The trees have evolved deep and strong roots that can pierce through the limestone into the subterranean rivers in order to draw a constant supply of water even in the dry seasons. The Saryds have explored only a tiny fraction of the caves.`
	planet Watcher
		description `Watcher is a small moon, the only world in this system that sustains any indigenous life. Because of the low gravity, humans have not yet built a permanent settlement here, but it is occasionally visited by biologists interested in studying low-gravity life forms. There are forests here where the trees grow over two hundred meters tall.`
	planet Wayfarer
		description `Wayfarer was initially settled by a team of scientists and diplomats seeking to build a relationship with the Quarg worlds to the galactic southeast of here. Partly through the aid of the Quarg and partly through a desire to emulate them, it has grown into a very technologically advanced world.`
		description `		The Tarazed Corporation, a maker of alien-inspired ships and outfits, is one of the largest industries on Wayfarer, and they draw raw materials from throughout this region of space.`
	planet "Weir of Glubatub"
		description `The Weir of Glubatub is a quiet ocean world, lit by a dim red sun, whose atmosphere seldom gathers enough energy to spawn storms or other violent weather. Nearly all the life in the oceans is very close to the surface, where the sun's light is bright enough for algae and seaweed to flourish.`
		description `		A few of the larger islands have been settled by the Arachi, and most of the locals work in the fishing industry. Some of the fishing boats are so large that a small starship can land on their decks.`
	planet Weledos
		description `Weledos was colonized even before the Avgi evacuated their orbital assets to the Tangled Shroud. A few brave pioneers were willing to settle within the unpredictable systems of the Shroud to escape the planetary governments of Avgi space. They are said to have surveyed and colonized the planet before most explorers had even reached the entrance to the Shroud, surprising early scouts with their presence.`
		description `		Unfortunately, the Ensemble system is poor in metals and other natural resources, and civilization here had regressed to almost pre-spaceflight levels by the time the Incursion brought a wave of refugees here. The indefensibility of the system coupled with the hostility of the Tangled Shroud forced the Avgi diaspora to settle further beyond Ensemble, despite calls to deposit more civilians here.`
	planet Windblain
		description `Nearly three quarters of the surface of Windblain is ocean. Most of the industry here centers around petrochemicals: deep sea oil drilling, refining, and manufacture of plastic composites and synthetic fabrics for clothing. There are a few large cities on the continents, but also plenty of wilderness spaces as yet untouched by human activity.`
		description `		The local climate and economy are neither good enough to attract immigration, nor bad enough to drive people to leave. There seems to be almost no interest in the affairs of the wider galaxy.`
	planet Winter
		description `The dense clouds in Winter's atmosphere block out much of the sunlight, creating a frigid landscape below. The planet was not settled until about a century ago, when a group of investors from Pherkad decided to build a manufacturing center here, rather than trying to find more land on the already overcrowded planet of Solace. Claiming that the industrial emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases would eventually warm the planet and turn it into a tropical paradise, they were able to draw enough settlers to keep the factories going.`
		description `		The temperatures have risen measurably since the arrival of the human colonists, but without more intentional efforts it may be another century before the planet warms enough to be truly comfortable to live on.`
	planet "Wormhole Barren Alpha"
	planet "Wormhole Barren Beta"
	planet "Wormhole Link"
	planet "Wye Tzeou"
		description `Wye Tzeou is found in a noticeably quiet system. Its surface is covered in extreme crystalline-like structures protruding out in various fashions. These constructs are all exceptionally tall, and no two look alike. It seems the actual surface of the planet is far beneath a layer of these mysterious pillars. There is no obvious environmental reason for this composition as the soft snowy seasons and calm low winds are the most active natural elements on Wye Tzeou.`
		description `		Deep scans reveal even more odd compositions below, showing pockets in the depths of the glass forest that look like giant empty gaps between each pillar.`
	planet "Wyvern Station"
		description `Wyvern Station was once one of the end destinations for the merchant caravans traveling along the Rim, back in the days before the Republic existed when most systems were not policed and the only way to avoid being plundered by pirates was for ships to travel in large convoys. It has also been a continuously operating hyperspace fuel refinery for more than three centuries.`
	planet Xerolophos
		description `Although formerly classified as a "Hot Jupiter," Xerolophos does not present all the characteristics of one: it is very far from the system star - so distant that it isn't even tidally locked to it. Its temperature, instead, is unusually high even for a Hot Jupiter, with the core internally heating up the atmosphere much more than expected.`
		description `		While it's possible that Xerolophos might have migrated here long ago, the Remnant haven't been able to explain the extreme temperatures of the planet even after years of studies and dispatching dozens of probes.`
	planet Xurelei
		description `Xurelei's atmosphere is covered with huge tempests that would engulf an Earth-sized planet many times over. Strangely enough, these storms are outwardly much less violent than those recorded from other gas giants, and are easily traversable by probes and other exploration craft. Once below a certain depth, the storms become exponentially more dangerous. The cause of this drastic shift in intensity is unknown.`
		description `		In the lower layers, small, peculiar twinkles of light in the forms of organic shapes begin to appear, flowing gracefully along with the harsh winds. Although further exploration is impossible due to the fierce weather, the unusual objects darting beneath the clouds appear to be unaffected.`
	planet Yedikule
		description `Although much smaller than most gaseous planets - including the one it orbits - the thick atmosphere of Yedikule and its rocky core make it a gas dwarf. While it was not the first to be discovered in human history, it is very improbable to have formed around a gas giant, and the extreme differences between its atmosphere and the one of Xerolophos further suggest this was not its original location.`
		description `		While virtually every craft that tries to land here is a fuel scooping drone, a large number of satellites orbit Yedikule at various heights, meaning that it must have been exhaustively studied in the past.`
	planet Yiddoi
		description `Yiddoi appears to be the product of a failed attempt at terraforming predating the Avgi, or one that was abandoned before it was complete. A blend of clearly synthetic reflective compounds was at one point injected into the moon's atmosphere, ostensibly to reduce incoming sunlight and cool its boiling surface.`
	planet "Yiia Iyr"
		description `Much of Yiia Iyr is obscured by several layers of dark clouds, and what little sunlight makes it to the surface highlights withered plains and dried up riverbeds. Thick layers of fog are often found hugging the ground, and soft, cool air brushes against shrivelling grass fields. There is no discernible cause for why Yiia Iyr appears to be so inhospitable despite having been able to support an ecosystem in the past.`
	planet "Yniu Eiu"
		description `Yniu Eiu is a rocky world with many canyons. A large portion of the surface is bright shades of gray and white, but the more striking visuals are the patches of purple-red webbed lakes and rivers flowing across the surface. It is unclear if this is a natural occurrence or if these were artificially created, but the way the areas around these sites are dug out and shaped implies that this planet used to be a home to some type of civilization, or one that found importance in this material.`
		description `		The surface of these red-purple lakes and rivers move in odd ways that make them seem almost alive. Although they flow at extremely low rates, they also softly bulge and contract in a curious linear motion.`
	planet "Yniu Ena"
		description `Like its parent planet below, Yniu Ena has a thick purple-reddish web of unnatural material spread across its surface, forming rivers and large lakes. While most of these lakes are rather small relative to the planet's surface, there are a few as large as oceans that give the appearance of scars on the planet.`
	planet Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa
		description `Yoqqa-Vasa-Vasa's atmosphere is unusually thick for a planet of its size, and contains a very high concentration of carbon monoxide, which, while harmless to the Successors because of their different biochemistry, is highly toxic to humans. The planet supports a rich and biodiverse planetary ecosystem, with large jungles straddling its equatorial regions that give way to strikingly beautiful mountain ranges near the poles.`
		description `		It also serves as the planetary bastion of House Seineq, an especially old and noble House from the old empire that immigrated here during the collapse, soon allying with Houses Aqrabe and Kaatrij to assert its claim to the surrounding systems. This alliance between the so-called New Houses persists to the present day, where Seineq is widely considered the first among equals within it.`
	planet Zenith
		description `Zenith is a cold and unpleasant world, where the fog seldom lifts and the sun is rarely seen, where much of the lowlands are flooded each day by the tide, and storms are unpredictable and fierce. It has, however, one major advantage as a place to settle: it is far enough away that the Republic makes no attempt to control it.`
		description `		Several villages have been founded near the equator, and in addition there are an unknown number of private holdings, ranging from underground bunkers to enormous concrete fortresses. Because the land is owned by no government and anyone can build a dwelling without permission or paperwork as long as they are willing to fight off any other claimants, the total population of Zenith is unknown.`
	planet Zug
		description `Zug is a pleasant world of rolling hills, fertile fields, and a few small oceans. Hundreds of millions of people live here, with more immigrants arriving every day, almost faster than the construction industry can keep up with them. In addition to the larger cities, many people live in smaller farming villages, making this one of the few worlds in the region that is truly self-sufficient both in industry and in agriculture.`
		description `		The largest industry on Zug is Southbound Shipyards, which focuses on designing well-defended merchant ships to survive the pirates that are so common here.`
	planet Zydee
		description `Although this moon initially seems barren and lifeless, there is evidence that the nearby Gegno Scin have recently attempted to set up an outpost here. Several partially-constructed buildings and landing zones are scattered about the surface, but none of them show any signs of activity, likely due to recent warfare with the Gegno Vi. Despite this, a small number of satellites actively orbit Zydee, likely providing important tactical information such as the volume of system traffic.`
	planet "Scar's Hideout"

	planet Aspiration
		description `The world of Aspiration appears to be a mild, habitable world, but one currently in an advanced ice age now slowly retreating. The equatorial region of the planet is warm and comfortable, a cool temperate at the present time. The native biosphere seems to be mostly grasses and something resembling pine trees. In a few thousand years, it might look similar to Earth before it was paved over. For now, it's a sparse world with a single major town built on a promontory, overlooking a wide river mouth which carries runoff from continental scale glaciers to the sea.`
