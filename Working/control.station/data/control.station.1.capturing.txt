			`Ship Capturing Progression`
			`* "Bunkmax" means, you sell every outfit that is not needed, replace needed outfits by weaker ones, buy outfit expansion till you have no cargo or overheat, and install as many Bunk Rooms as possible. This means also no weapons.`
			`* The bunkmax number can be a little bit higher if you invest time and money to find the perfect outfits.`
			`* Your fleet should be equipped with beam weapons, to not destroy the target.`
			`* You can skip many ships in this list, based on your choice and luck.`
			`* Start with 'Laser Rifle' hand-to-hand outfits, better get 'Fragmentation Grenade', and when reaching Korath ships do the Heliarch/Lunarium storyline to get the 'Enforcer Riot Gear'/'Anti-Materiel Gun'.`
