planet "Donya"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/fields29
	description `Donya is a lush, green, Earth-like world filled with vegetation and growing matter. With clouds and a blue sky, it was idyllic in the eyes of early settlers and the billionaire philanthropists who funded them.`
 	description `	Despite the beauty and the funding, it remains unsettled, as rains of poisonous acid fall on regular timeframes, rendering the planet uninhabitable to human life. The foliage planted by the initial wave of colonists to scrub the skies of the rain seems to have adjusted to the terrible liquid quite well, although it hasn't managed to entirely eliminate it. The planters, who couldn't bear the dreadful weather, left when they discovered that they couldn't stop the rains.`

planet "Ealam"
	attributes uninhabited "requires: gaslining"
	landscape land/clouds9
	description `As far as gas giants go, Ealam is somewhat sparse. There do not seem to be the storms prevalent on other worlds categorized like this one, and in fact you can see for a surprising distance. Blue-tinted sky is the only thing that stops you from being able to see right through the outer rim of the planet.`
	description `	It is strange that from the outside, this gaseous body seems to have a brown hue.`

planet "New Gettysburg"
	attributes uninhabited
	landscape land/water22
	description `New Gettysburg - a peaceful beachside planet, with trees on the shores and a wonderfully clear liquid element. Or so the first settlers thought. However, they were unable to land on the high mesas, and when they attempted to live in the forests disaster struck.`
	description `	The trees on New Gettysburg have a wonderful talent for cracking and falling to the ground at the slightest touch. The settlers, who had to build among the trees, decided that this battle was too hard, and left, after each signed a vow never to come back.`

planet "Zweig"
	attributes abandoned uninhabited
	landscape land/city26
	description `The colonization of Zweig was long and hard, but it produced results like no-one had ever heard of before. Cities prospered, and anyone who came to Zweig was sure to get rich - until the day the terrorists took over. The Navy was called, and when the terrorists were arrested the Navy gave permission for people to come back and resettle.`
	description `	Nobody ever did. The general concern was more terrorists. But the governments of certain planets also had wishes for new millionares to stay on their soil, and made no effort to rehabilitate any settler.`
	description ``
	description `	Zweig remains an abandoned planet to this day.`
