	description `	Lilac is the home of the arena, and one of the most popular planets to go to. Many people are surprised that the area is as calm as it is. Some say that the security patrolling the area is almost useless as no pirates try to invade. Intrestingly enough, even rival companies are calmer in the area by each one sending at least a basic shipment of outifts or ships every month or so.`
	spaceport `	The spaceport in Lilac, while filled to the brim with restraunts, hotels, and attractions, is also surprisingly calm with nice pilots, helpful landing assistants, and charming guides to show you around the spaceport and any other nearby areas.`
