	description `The Cleaver is essentially a more powerful version of the Sunder, made by a small company on Maelstrom. ALR Manufacturing had great plans to show who the Cleaver belonged to; as a result the whole ship must be covered in paint to show its loyalty. As it uses imported products such as the Tractor Beam, the Cleaver has a rather high price tag.`
	description `	Following the tradition, the Cleaver has a roomy cargo bay; enough to make anyone flying it rich.`
