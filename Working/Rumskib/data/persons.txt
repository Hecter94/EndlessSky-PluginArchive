			"When you scan my ship, you see the Power of Plasma."
			"The default Splinter comes equipped for speed, not power. I changed that."
			"Plasma weapons are great at overheating. The only problem is, I overheat myself."
			"Shooting pirates is the only worthwhile thing to do."
			"There are these strange 'bad guys' appearing out of nowhere near where I got this ship. I really like them; they seem to be overheaters. Just like me." # This allusion to the Korath may be too obvious, but it's a great reference.
			"Guess what. The Republic leader is an Alpha. I wish I could be teleported to Earth."
			"Nunki once paid me tribute, but no more. Or was it Bloodsea?"
			"Shoot 'em. Bang bang."
			"Gatling Guns are ridiculously overpowered and expensive."
			"Exploring the Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim's former territory is a nightmare. How not on Earth do they have so many Leviathans?"
			"You'll never guess where I got my name... or what it is."
			"The Splinter is Megaparsec's best ship. Those Protectors are too slow, and Quicksilvers can't hold Plasma Turrets."
			"Plasma, plasma. Overheat, overheat. Shoot, shoot."
			"I wish I could join the Navy, but they won't let me. I refuse to give up this Splinter."
			"I wish I could join the Syndicate, but they won't let me. For some reason, the corporate leaders have a prejudice against Southbound-sold weapons. Poor plasma."

			"Sometimes IFF indicators don't work well. I'm apparently friendly to everyone." 2

			"Other weapons can damage shields all they want, but I like my hull destroyers." 2
			"We call him Dr. RJG - all pirates owe their Gatling ideas to him." 2
			"Ionic engines are terribly power-efficient compared to atomic engines. I mean, with Gatlings, who needs the extra power?" 2
			"Technically this is a Marauder Saber, because I modified it to have two more tons of outfit space - and to hold as much Gatling Gun Ammo as I want."
			"I've heard of alien species far less advanced than the Quarg, but it's impossible for them to have better weapons than the Gatling."
			"Gatling Guns were invented about a thousand years ago, and are still one of the best weapons in the universe."
			"Hey look, I can Morse signal with Gatling Guns!"
			"I dislike plasma engines. There's this crazy guy in a Splinter who uses them, but anyone with plasma turrets is just a joke."
			"Doctor Richard Jordan Gatling was the best person who ever lived."
			"I know someone commonly regarded as the best Gatling Gun salesman in the universe."
			"These Marauders know how to modify ships so well. They added literal tons of space to my Saber."
			"I learned some tricks from the Marauders, and added almost unlimited ammo capacity to my ship. Now I'll never run out!"
