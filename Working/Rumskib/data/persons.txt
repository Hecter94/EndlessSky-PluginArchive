			"When you scan my ship, you see the Power of Plasma."
			"The default Splinter comes equipped for speed, not power. I changed that."
			"Plasma weapons are great at overheating. The only problem is, I overheat myself."
			"Shooting pirates is the only worthwhile thing to do."
			"There are these strange 'bad guys' appearing out of nowhere near where I got this ship. I really like them; they seem to be overheaters. Just like me." # This allusion to the Korath may be too obvious, but it's a great reference.

			"Exploring the Confederated Councils of the Outer Rim's former territory is a nightmare. How not on Earth do they have so many Leviathans?"
			"You'll never guess where I got my name... or what it is."
			"The Splinter is Megaparsec's best ship. Those Protectors are too slow, and Quicksilvers can't hold Plasma Turrets."
			"Plasma, plasma. Overheat, overheat. Shoot, shoot."
			"I wish I could join the Navy, but they won't let me. I refuse to give up this Splinter."
			"I wish I could join the Syndicate, but they won't let me. For some reason, the corporate leaders have a prejudice against Southbound-sold weapons. Poor plasma."
