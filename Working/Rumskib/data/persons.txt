			"Technically this is a Marauder Saber, because I modified it to have two more tons of outfit space - and to hold as much Gatling Gun Ammo as I want."
			"I've heard of alien species far less advanced than the Quarg, but it's impossible for them to have better weapons than the Gatling."
			"Gatling Guns were invented about a thousand years ago, and are still one of the best weapons in the universe."
			"Hey look, I can Morse signal with Gatling Guns!"
			"I dislike plasma engines. There's this crazy guy in a Splinter who uses them, but anyone with plasma turrets is just a joke."
