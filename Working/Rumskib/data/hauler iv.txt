	description "For years, the Hauler III design had been considered the largest Hauler, the slowest, and the one with the greatest space-to-required crew ratio."
	description "	But recently Southbound, seeing an increase in Hauler sales, decided to make an even bigger version. The Hauler IV has much more space then the Hauler III."
	description "	However, the designers neglected to increase the space for weapons, engines, or other outfits. Thus the Hauler IV goes even slower, and is a nightmare to land and launch. The repulsors alone cost a tenth of the production cost."
