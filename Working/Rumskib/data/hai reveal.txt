So far, no one is explicitly claiming to know what's going on though, and even for a place like this the effort seems... ungoverned. Even to the extent that some groups seem to be actively pretending to be involved while surreptitiously not joining in with groups that leave on the hunt.`
			`	It's all very odd, but one thing you do glean from the constant conversation and the small selection of individuals loudly demanding cooperation is that the "angel of death," as they're calling it, is unusually short and fast, and capable of things which give you reason to suspect they might possibly be a Hai.`

The grenade lands squarely on the ramp, sending a fine mist all around their ship. The men, hands halfway to their weapons, all drop to the ground instead; from the screams of pain and the sounds of convulsion coming from behind you, they're probably not going to trouble you any longer.`

An occasional tour of duty with the military, a thrill-seeking adventure with the hopes of getting a reaction upon returning, or even... defection to our brethren. If the authorities tried to track down every single Hai who went missing as soon as they went missing, they'd spend their time chasing their tails fruitlessly.`

			`On approach to the spaceport on Earth, you request to speak to an official of significant standing on diplomatic business. Thanks to your renown from the Pug war, you are able to shortcut objections stemming from you yourself not being a diplomat. The diplomatic ID from the box Sayari gave you, when presented, also seems to trigger some sort of classified override, fast-tracking the process from the quoted "two to three business days" to "two hours after landing."`
			`	The Republic's Deputy Minister for Foreign Affairs meets you in a private room at the spaceport.`
			`	"Captain <last>," he steps around the table to grasp your hand in a firm handshake. "Xilin Yang. It's an honor to meet a hero of the Pug crisis such as yourself."`
			choice
				`	"It was hard-fought, but it was necessary."`
				`	"Thanks, but it wasn't as dramatic as they made it out to be. I'm just happy to have helped where I could."`
					goto humble
			`	You play the part and try to act noble. Mr. Yang seems more than happy to embody respect for the hero of his preferred narrative.`
			`	"You're every inch what I expected," he assures you before moving to take his seat.`
				goto sit
			label humble
			`	You shrug, palms up, and explain, "You should listen to the xenoanthropologists. The Pug were just here to test us, to make us really consider what mattered and come together."`
			`	For a moment his expression falters, and then he seems almost relieved. "You may be a better person than I expected to meet."`
			`	He offers you a genuine smile as he takes his seat.`
			label sit
			`	You sit down opposite him and explain how the Hai have proposed that you be their official contact point for humanity on account of your fame from the war.`
			`	He asks a few questions for clarity, and when you're done he requests you wait while he makes a call. He leaves the room for a long while, and at one point an aide comes in and offers you refreshments while deliberations continue elsewhere. Much to your surprise the fruity beverage is actually quite light and not too sweet, reminding you briefly that most of humanity's food styles originated here.`
			`	Eventually Mr. Yang returns. "So sorry for that. I hope you were looked after suitably while you waited."`
			`	Once you nod your assent, he continues, "Well, obviously the Republic knows about the Hai, but for the moment our official "line" is that the government does not trade in rumors. However, an appropriate response is clearly needed. Republic Intelligence briefed the Cabinet of the Free Worlds Senate just yesterday. They have demanded that they have a diplomatic representative along for any decisions. This is already standard practice for the Syndicate. If you are willing, I will come with you to meet two individuals known as Katya Reynolds and Samuel Remington on Deep and Foundry respectively. I believe you already know them?"`

				`	"Yes."`
				`	"Samuel Remington?"`

			`	"Remington is the Syndicate's head of public relations, and exactly the man we need in an event like this," he explains while gathering two datapads and a selection of folders, shoving them into a briefcase.`

			`	"Now, the situation is progressing quickly and plans are still being made, so I am not entirely sure if it is they themselves who will be coming with us. Someone of Remington's caliber is likely too busy to come personally, but we'll find out when we get there. In any case I think we should go to Deep first for speed, but you are the captain. Shall we be off?"`

When the Republic briefed the new Chancellor and his Cabinet on the Hai, he brought us in for advice. We thought to try and reach you, but of course you would somehow manage to be in the thick of it before we even knew what was going on."`
			`	You hug them both in turn and return the greeting. "I thought it seemed odd when they said I was meeting you for this, Katya, but it makes much more sense if you were just easier to get a hold of than Alondo here."`
			`	"Oh, it was always going to be Alondo," she says, "but there's never a bad excuse for traveling with an old friend, especially when you're meeting other friends too."`
			`	"Do we have time for a drink before we leave?" asks Alondo.`
			`	You look around at the busy spaceport and see the workers haven't even noticed your ship waiting for refueling yet.`
			`	"I think we can spare a short while, and you really should meet Mr. Yang."`
			`	Mr. Yang had been studiously pretending he wasn't eavesdropping from a distance of a few meters but, before you could call him over, Alondo's slightly suggestive comment of, "Oh, I should definitely meet Mr. Yang," had evidently been overheard.`
			`	Fortunately, after an hour and a couple of drinks, the embarrassment is long-forgotten when you return to your ship.`
