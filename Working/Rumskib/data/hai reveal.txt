			`Following reports of the last time the "angel of death" was sighted, you end up loitering in a twisting street parallel to a main thoroughfare. The few people using it hurry by quickly, and rarely seem to travel any great distance down this street. One very surly looking individual gives you a sour glare on his way past, a collection of weapons on full display. He looks a lot like you'd expect a bounty hunter to look, and as he moves out of sight you observe a shadow, previously motionless, detach from a spot on a wall and head back your direction, laser rifle pointed in the direction of the departing individual. As the shadow approaches, you see there's a lot of hair sticking out from their hood. They might be a Hai. Do you want to talk to them?`

			`As you come in you are informed that all the ships are being searched before departure. No sooner do you disembark your ship than you notice that there's a lot of paranoid goons with weapons hot. Like a lot. There seems to be some kind of manhunt going on for a short, hooded, "angel of death" who has been loitering in dark alleyways. So far, no one is explicitly claiming to know what's going on though, and even for a place like this the effort seems... ungoverned. Even to the extent that some groups seem to be actively pretending to be involved while surreptitiously not joining in with groups that leave on the hunt.`
			`	It's all very odd, but one thing you do glean from the constant conversation and the small selection of individuals loudly demanding cooperation is that the "angel of death," as they're calling it, is unusually short and fast, and capable of things which give you reason to suspect they might possibly be a Hai.`

Despite your precautions, though, as you weave between parked ships on your final approach, you notice several men sitting on a nearby ship's loading ramp looking intently at Ooonem, their guns lying close by. Before the men are able to make a grab for their weapons, Ooonem pulls a gas grenade out of her cloak and throws it at the gunmen in one smooth movement. The grenade lands squarely on the ramp, sending a fine mist all around their ship. The men, hands halfway to their weapons, all drop to the ground instead; from the screams of pain and the sounds of convulsion coming from behind you, they're probably not going to trouble you any longer.`
			`	"I had better leave these behind," she says, dropping a few gas grenades on the ground. "I took them off some pirates a few days ago. They're quite illegal." You notice a label on the grenades: "Sarin Gas: twenty-meter radius." This was a nerve gas grenade that uses one of the older varieties of the gas. They're cheap and plentiful in pirate space.`

If the authorities tried to track down every single Hai who went missing as soon as they went missing, they'd spend their time chasing their tails fruitlessly.`

One man throws a small grenade with a green light on top. You recognize it as a low-level EMP device.
