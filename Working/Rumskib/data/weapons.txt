	description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	The Quadruple Beam Laser is a modified version of the regular Beam Laser. The designers took the opportunity to make it slightly more precise and decreased the heat per second for each individual laser, but as four packed together it is still much hotter than a normal laser."

	description "While swords are seen today as being old curios and commemorative objects, rendered useless when gunpowder became dominant on the battlefield thousands of years ago, this sword is unlike any you have seen before. Despite how heavy it looks, it is remarkably light, and there are inscriptions on the blade itself that don't appear to be like any human language."
	description "	For whatever reason, the red beam within the blade seems to pulsate as you swing it; perhaps there is more to the sword than you know."
