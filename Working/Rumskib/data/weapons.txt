	description "In the early part of the space era, the settlements in the region of space known as the Deep developed in relative isolation from the rest of human space. One result of that isolation is that their weapons technology mostly uses beam weapons, instead of the energy projectile weapons that are more common elsewhere."
	description "	The Quadruple Beam Laser is a modified version of the regular Beam Laser. The designers crammed together four beams for better space usage, but at the cost of less accuracy, more heat and less energy efficiency."

	description "Unlike the Laser Turret, the quadified version does not turn fast enough to hold off fighter pilots. However, the doubled damage output more than makes up for this slight disadvantage."
	description "	Although it would make more sense to mount a Quad Beam Laser on a turret, Deep Sky instead decided to double the lasers held by the normal laser turret as a cheaper way to increase the damage output."

	description "The Quad Plasma Turret is even more powerful than the standard Plasma Turret, but its size makes it rather impractical - it costs more than a flight of fighters and would occupy almost all of a medium warship's weapon space. As such, no sane independent captain will use it."

	description `In an act that would make Dr. Richard J. Gatling spin in his grave with the ferocity of the barrels of his invention, the Gatling Turret was born when a resourceful pirate thought to replace the Energy Blasters on a Blaster Turret with a pair of Gatling Guns. Ever since, the dominion of the Gatling Turret has spread across the Southern Rim, terrorizing merchants and law enforcement alike with its unparalleled ability to tear apart the hulls of ships.`
	description `	The Single Gatling Turret came into existence when a pirate decided that the space requirements for the Blaster Turret were too high and dismounted one of the Gatling guns, creating a turret that turns even faster. As a result, this turret is the best anti-fighter weapon employed by pirates.`
