	description `The Eyrie is even bigger, larger, and more powerful then the Skein. The Free Worlds only developed the Eyrie after years of battle with the Republic and testing of Hauler Type F designs. When any ships larger then this size had trouble moving, the Eyrie was determined as the absolute size limit for ships of this type.`
	description `	The Free Worlds decided that Southbound was not even allowed to put the Eyrie in the shipyard; instead, it is given directly to only the most trusted captains.`
