	description `The Cleaver is essentially a more powerful version of the Sunder, made by a small company on Maelstrom. ALR Manufacturing had great plans to show who the Cleaver belonged to; as a result the whole ship must be covered in paint to show its loyalty. As it uses imported products such as the Tractor Beam, the Cleaver has a rather high price tag.`
	description `	Following the tradition, the Cleaver has a roomy cargo bay; enough to make anyone flying it rich.`

	description `This ship is a modified version of a captured Navy Gunboat. Although there is little most pirates can do to improve the already advanced shielding, they can still weld on a few extra hull reinforcements and an extra pair of guns. This gives them a tough and reasonably fast gun platform to quickly attack, plunder, and escape.`

	description "The Behemoth is a recent ship design from Betelgeuse Shipyards, designed as an alternative to the Syndicate Bulk Freighter. Although its cargo capacity is somewhat lower, it is also more maneuverable, and packs a heavier armament by default."

	description "The Tanager is a new model of transport ship from Tarazed Shipyards. More nimble compared to models of shuttlecraft from Betelgeuse, it is also supplemented with a greater capacity for defensive armaments; a necessity in the region of space that surrounds Tarazed."
	description "	The Tanager also comes with a decent amount of free space, allowing for a much greater level of customization."
