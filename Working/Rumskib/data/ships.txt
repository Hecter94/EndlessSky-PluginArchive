	description `The Cleaver is essentially a more powerful version of the Sunder, made by a small company on Shroud and distributed to a few other select planets. The designers of ALR Manufacturing had great plans to show who the Cleaver belonged to, but the builders ended up deciding to use parts from the original Sunder, and the ship did not look nearly as colorful as the original concept dictated. As the shipyards use imported products such as the Tractor Beam, the Cleaver has a rather high price tag.`
	description `	Following the tradition, the Cleaver has a roomy cargo bay; enough to make anyone flying it rich.`

	description `This ship is a modified version of a captured Navy Gunboat. Although there is little most pirates can do to improve the already advanced shielding, they can still weld on a few extra hull reinforcements and an extra pair of guns. This gives them a tough and reasonably fast gun platform to quickly attack, plunder, and escape.`

	description "The Dragonfly was a light transport, designed for bringing a small number of very rich passengers - Syndicate CEOs, for example - from one planet to another with speed and style. It makes up for its light armament by being able to outrun nearly every other ship in the sky."
	description "	That is, it was a light transport until a scheming Megaparsec engineer came up with a combination of the Arrow and the Wasp, at which point it became something much deadlier. While still not strong enough for close combat, the Dragonfly can easily defeat much larger enemies by simply staying away and bombarding them with missiles."

	description `After introducing the "Type F" cargo pod for the Hauler, it became apparent to merchant captains that the new carriers could offer more flexibility within their fleet if there were a cargo box they could attach to the fighter arms. Enter the "F6-C: Boxwing," the Fighter that doesn't fight, but carries cargo instead. Cargo preservation equipment gives the Boxwing much more mass and very poor heat dissipation characteristics compared to other fighters. That it cannot carry any weapons is only part of the reason jocks call it "Flying Coffin" amongst themselves; besides the ship resembling one and being very sluggish, the pilot "seat" doubles as a bunk, and is cramped beyond the comfort level of most. The interactive panoramic window H.U.D. is the only thing that keeps claustrophobic episodes from becoming a major problem.`
	description "	Well, the Boxwing wasn't supposed to fight. This maraudified version has a single gun port, equipped with a deadly weapon - the Quad Beam Laser."
	description "	Fighters do not come equipped with a hyperdrive. You cannot carry a fighter unless you have a ship in your fleet with a fighter bay."

	description "Combat drones are pilotless attack ships used primarily by the Republic Navy. Although very weak and easy to destroy, they can be very effective in large numbers. Because drones do not need a cockpit, they can be filled entirely with equipment and solid metal, which makes their hulls stronger than other small ships."
	description "	This Combat Drone has been captured from the Navy and Maraudified. It now has space for a Heavy Laser and has a thicker hull - though this comes at the cost of almost doubled mass and a slightly lower top speed."

	description "Historically, the Remnant have not needed to support remote fleet operations. It had, however, been anticipated as a part of their contingency plans to support large scale evacuations. The first Remnant survived by running, modern Remnant prosper through mobility, and it is expected that the Remnant of the future shall thrive by those same means."
	description "	The Swan, thus, was designed first and foremost to be a refueler. Not only carrying a prodigous amount of fuel as well as massive arrays to collect more, but also ferrying a number of fighters and drones that can be used to deliver fuel to other ships in the fleet. It can also carry a significant amount of cargo."
	description "	The cloaking technology is built into the Swan's hull; it cannot be removed or transferred to another ship. The Remnant engineers note that, due to its size, the Swan's cloak is both slower and consumes significantly more energy and fuel than other present-day designs."
