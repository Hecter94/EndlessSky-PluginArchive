# Rumskib

Adds more ships for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky): the Cutlass, the Tanager, the Hauler IV, and the Eyrie.

The Tanager is a better version of the Shuttle, with the sprite made by bene-dictator, while the Cutlass is a piratified Gunboat, made by 1010todd.
The Hauler IV is a Hauler III that has been slightly expanded, while the Eyrie continues the Nest/Roost/Skein line.

Cross-plugin compatibility with Blended Ships exists; so if you've got both installed there will be fleet variants with Blended Ship ships and Rumskib ships together.
When you uninstall Blended Ships the variants should remove correctly and no errors will be caused.

Assets for all ships can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/new-ship-assets).
