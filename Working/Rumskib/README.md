# Rumskib

Adds more ships for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky): the Cleaver, the Cutlass, and the Tanager.

The Tanager is a better version of the Shuttle, with the sprite made by bene-dictator, while the Cutlass is a piratified Gunboat, made by 1010todd.

I made the Cleaver as a more powerful Sunder made by a different company.

There is cross-plugin compatibility with both [Blended Ships](https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships) and [DAIS](https://github.com/Daeridanii1/DAIS).

Assets can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/homula-rumskib-assets).
