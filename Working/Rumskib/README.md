# Rumskib

Adds two new ships for [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky): the Cutlass and the Tanager.

The Tanager is a better version of the Shuttle, with the sprite made by bene-dictator, while the Cutlass is a piratified Gunboat, made by 1010todd.

Cross-plugin compatibility with Blended Ships exists; so if you've got both installed there will be fleet variants with Blended Ship ships and Rumskib ships together.
When you uninstall Blended Ships the variants should remove correctly and no errors will be caused; but I don't know how to prevent errors when Rumskib is uninstalled.

Assets for both ships can be found [here](https://github.com/TheGiraffe3/new-ship-assets).
