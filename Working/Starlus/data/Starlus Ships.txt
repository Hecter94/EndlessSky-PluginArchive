Now though, the Starlus use this vessel as a scouting platform and as a surveillance platform through their region of space.`

	description `This medium sized Warship easily rivals human warships in terms of raw firepower. It is capable of holding the mighty foreshadow turret and serves as a heavy battleship against highly shielded targets. As such, it is rarely found in patrols and is instead reserved for battles and defensive postings that require immense firepower.`
	description `Because of the complexity of this vessel, it can only be built in specialized shipyards and is not as widely available within Starlus space.`

It features immense firepower and armour capable of withstanding even the most punishing of blows. The few fleets of these warships in existence are highly valued and closely guarded as they serve as a major part of the Starlus military fleets.`
	description `Because of the size and complexity of this vessel, it can only be produced in a few select locations within Starlus territory and is reserved for only heavy duty combat roles and core guard duties.`
