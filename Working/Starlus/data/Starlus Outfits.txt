	description `This is the smallest active nuclear generator operated by the Starlus. It works almost like a standard nuclear reactor, but instead of heating water or another coolant which could ultimately contaminate the water the Starlus live in, it transfers all its energy to an organic mesh which turns it into a revolving magnetic field which is then turned into electricity by large induction coils.`

	description `This is considered a medium sized reactor by the Starlus, it employs the same nuclear-organic technology as its siblings. However, while this technology is very efficient at producing electricity, it does waste an awful lot of heat requiring either large heat sinks or heavy cooling.`

	description `This small device modifies the Starlus engines in such a way that they produce around 150% of nominal thrust, but at the expense of requiring more energy than an additional standalone engine would and producing far more heat.`
	description `Because it modifies the existing engines, this can increase performance on compatible engines without using extra engine space.`

	description `Whilst most Starlus ships are completely unusable by humans, this conversion allows a former starlus ship to operate under human control.`
	description `The conversion means that fewer crew is required due to humans being more adept at performing ship-board tasks and bunk count is lower because of the extra space required for each person. Mass is also decreased as humans only require air to breath and the ship no longer needs to be filled with water.`
