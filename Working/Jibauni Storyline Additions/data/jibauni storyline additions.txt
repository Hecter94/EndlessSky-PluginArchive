As you know, we recently conquered Andwerfen and the system of Almanhaq, the location we now are in. However, we have a situation. Many of our ships have been destroyed. Therefore, I would like to propose that we retreat back to Baitoon to regroup."`

I, for one, am glad that Captain <last> made this known to us, and nominate <first> for an immediate payment of a hundred thousand credits. Who agrees with me?"

			`	At that moment, a disturbance arises in the crowd. One Jibauni is rushing out of the area in the direction of the spaceport. Although a chase is quickly organized, the stranger gets away before the persuit reaches the spaceport. It seems the Rebel Jibauni will receive news of the retreat; it is moved forwards to the evening.
