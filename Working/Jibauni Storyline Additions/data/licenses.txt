			`Kanlanmo is outside your ship as the <model> touches down. He comes aboard as soon as the hatch is opened.

			`Kanlanmo enters the cockpit as you land. "Well, what did I tell you, <first>?" he asks. "It is wonderful, right?" You both look at the planet in awe, before Kanlanmo heads towards the exit. "Come on," he says. "We have got to get you registered. At the moment, you are only allowed to be here because I am with you."`
