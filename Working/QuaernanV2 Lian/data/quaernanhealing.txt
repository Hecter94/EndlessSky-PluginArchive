	description "This enormous shield system is a hybrid between a massive regenerator and some kind of shield alteration field. In addition to being the primary source of shield aboard the Quaernan, it also dramatically improves the efficiency of other shield generators aboard the ship."
	description "It's believed that this device is what managed to protect the Quaernan when it crashed into Hope, as several capacitors aboard the enormous outfit were blown out during the initial repair."

	description "This massive outfit appears at first glance to be quite inefficient; however, closer inspection will reveal the clever engineering at play. While charging the shields, the device consumes extra power, using some kind of crystallization technique in the shields to provide extra shield thickness over the most vulnerable areas. The result is a much more durable shield that blocks projectiles better and is more resistant to all types of damage."

	description "This intelligent system provides more autonomous control of the response generators, increasing their power while cutting down on their heat cost. The system, however, does consume power and produce heat itself."

	description "This titanic shield generation unit is a larger response generator, intended to provide ample shield recharge even when fuel is scarce. It does, however, take up an absurd amount of space."

	description "Though the Transitive Regenerator is an excellent piece of technology, relying on hyperspace fuel to retain durability is seldom an opportune tactic. Thus, these responsive, energy-based regenerators were developed; though not as space- or power-efficient as their fuel-consuming bretheren, they are nonetheless a useful addition to the Quaernan's kit."

	description "This appears to be an attempt at making the Regenerator even more efficient; though it lacks the shield alteration technology of the Axonal Variant, it is not-insignificantly smaller."
	description "This regenerator works by using Deuterium as a medium to charge shields even faster, leading to rather excessive power efficiency at the cost of fuel usage and significant heat generation."

	description "A partner apparatus to the Axonal Regenerator and a massive boon in the caretaking of the ship, the Self-Maintenance Array is a massive AI computer that operates several nests of repair arms and emergency shield generators. Though not as powerful as the Axonal Regenerator, the Array's ability to fix hull drastically improves the surviveability of the Quaernan."
	description "During the crash, several repair arms were damaged, however the designs are remarkably similar to the repair arms used in the Syndicate's own manufacturing facilities."

	description "This is a system designed to outfit human workers with the necessary tools they need to maintain and repair the ship. Though less powerful than automated systems, humans are the most efficient, save for the fact that paying for training and lives lost on-duty can rack up a rather unfavourable tab."

	description "This appears to be a control console for somesort of modified shield matrix that has entirely mapped out the geometry of the Quaernan's hull, and is able to identify damage points. It greatly improves the effectiveness of other hull repair outfits, but can only provide marginal repairs to some parts of the Quaernan's hull."

	description "A system of bays for tiny drones equipped with repairing equipment like soldering and bolting tools. Dozens of docks holding hundreds of drones lie throughout the ship, and the drones are small enough to safely work beneath the Quaernan's shields, providing exceptional hull repair. Additionally, the drones are able to clean corrosive substances from the ship's hull, reducing the severity of such attacks."
	description "Because the drones need power for things other than hull maintenance, the system is quite energy inefficient. Additionally, the engines used by the drones can impart a moderate amount of heat onto the ship due to the close proximity."
