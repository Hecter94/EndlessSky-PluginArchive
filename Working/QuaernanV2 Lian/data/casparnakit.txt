	description `This curious turret is found on board Casparnans, and it appears to be a sort of "sidegrade" to the Anti-Torpedo sniper. Compared to that, this turret fires faster and hits harder, but has reduced effective range, seemingly compensating for the difference in role the Casparna fills.`

	description "This strange weapon comprises of a heat conduit that runs throughout the entire ship, channeling all of the ship's excess heat directly into this gun. Upon firing, all the heat is forced into the firing chamber using an inordinately strong heat pump, resulting in a thermally ionized plasma that is compressed into bolts and then discharged, dumping all of the heat from the Casparna's internals onto the first target it hits. The temperatures achieved by the projectiles are so hot that it can cause metals such as titanium to melt as if they were butter, and the heat can even cause premature burnoff in an enemy ship's fuel tanks."
	description "The downside of relying on the ship's heat systems to power the main cannon is that, if the ship is too cold, the gun will fail to fire, and this system also doubles as the primary heat expulsion method of the ship."

	description "This fabricator produces pyrophoric warheads and launches them quite quickly, delivering reliable area damage at a moderate range while without compromising too much on fire rate. The molotovs, though quick and easy to produce, are quite fragile, however, and will break under even moderate anti-missile fire."

	description "Related closely to the overloader turret, these turrets are bigger, and run even hotter; so hot that they leak heat as part of normal operation, without even firing. They do much more damage than their smaller brethren, but the larger, more energized projectiles fly slower, and are nowhere near as stable."
