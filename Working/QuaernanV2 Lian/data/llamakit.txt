	description "This is an odd outfit, resmebling no tech like any tech humanity has used before. It constantly agitates local space, not strong enough to damage ships, but enough to rustle the insides of missiles and cause them to prematurely explode."
	description "Sadly, its effect only works to a relatively limited range."

	description "This appears to be a heavily modified drone cannon; it doesn't do any more direct damage, but interferes with the target's shields and engines quite significantly for a weapon of its size, while firing faster, more accurate, longer-range, more damaging projectiles."
	description "It's impossible to tell why the weapon is named after an Ungulate's bodily fluid, but the namesake suggests it might be intended as the primary weapon."

	description "This is a far smaller implementation of the Beehive Cannon, able to be run successfully on a ship the size of a Llama, or theoretically even an Alpaca. Though its munitions are weaker and deliver less of a payload, they are far faster and nimbler, allowing them to close the great distances they often travel with ease."
	description "Of course, it still takes a considerable amount of time to create the projectiles, especially with the smaller-scale operation, so the fire rate is a bit lower."

	description "These are special plasma turrets that fire superheated ionized plasma, causing a heady mix of heat gain and power drain on the target. The projectiles, however, are quite slow, and suffer from wide spread over longer sight lines."
