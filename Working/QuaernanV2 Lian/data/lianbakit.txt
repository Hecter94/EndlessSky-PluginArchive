	description `This anti-missile works by targeting the space around a missile directly, rapidly tearing it apart in a flurry of rips in spacetime. Should it destroy its target, it can immediately start work on another one.`
	description `Like all turrets aboard the Lianba, it is characterized by less direct power, but colossal range.`

	description `At first glance, the name "Anti-Ship" in a shipboard weapon feels mostly redundant. However, this weapon fires large-bore energy bolts over colossal distances; able to contend with planetary defense systems in terms of range. By leveraging its enormous range, these otherwise uninteresting turrets provide a significant range advantage to any ship they're equipped on.`

	description "This pulsed beam is designed to force a target well beyond any sort of non-missile range; capable of throwing warships around like paper, what little damage it does deal is directly imparted onto the structure of the enemy ship."
	description "	If the beam isn't enough to evade targets, these turrets also collaborate to form a cloaking field across the ship, allowing it to hide in the odd event that an enemy catches the ship off-guard."

	description "An iterative improvement over the other Pileated Regenerators, but not an unwelcome one. Because the Lianbae rely more on hull than shields to survive, their shield systems are less developed than it seems they should be."

	description "Because the Lianbae lack the Casparnans' Thermobore cannon to cool off, the Lianbae must rely on these large, powerful coolers to shed heat instead. Thankfully, these also include heat sinks, allowing the Lianbae to soak up extra heat they might otherwise be unable to afford."

	description "Aboard the autonomous Lianbae lie these intensive Aquaponic setups, carefully managed by the AI (or human crew, should you change outfits around) to produce food for whatever purpose the overseers may see fit. Unlike the artificial ecosystem aboard the Quaernan, this system is designed solely for production; though the crops do vary wildly across the whole Lianba flotilla."

	description "Though the day-to-day operation of the Lianba doesn't typically result in egrigious fuel usage, there comes times where a bit of extra help can come in handy."
	description "	Reading through the old records gives some insight into the traditional operation of these craft; deployable refuelling posts were one of their many applications."

	description "Though not the most remarkable jump in power over its smaller cousin, the Core model of Hybrid Radiation Reactor works perfectly for the Lianbae it's installed on. Because they're not intended to directly weather combat, they can get away with these generators and larger power storage banks."
