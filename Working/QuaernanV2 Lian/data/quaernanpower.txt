	description "This remarkably enormous power storage system stores excess power as hydrogen, allowing it to store an incredible amount of energy. Additionally, pre-created hydrogen can be introduced into the system, allowing the enormous storage array to serve as a backup generator in emergencies."
	description "Since Hydrogen Power Storage is not dependent on ionic charges like in chemical batteries, the enormous storage unit also provides a rather substantial resilience towards ion damage."

	description "A massive series of thermocouples that transport heat, similarly to the components of the Heat Redistribution Web. Unlike the HRW, however, the Thermocouple Weave attempts to generate power from the heat transfer; the hotter the ship, the more power is generated."

	"heat generation" 3364.8
	description "This is a downsizing of the Hybrid Nuclear Mantle, and is the smallest generation unit on the ship. Though small, it's still incredibly powerful and efficient, supplying the Quaernan with the little extra power it needs."

	"energy generation" 6891.8
	"heat generation" 9280.6
	description "This is an interesting reactor configuration found aboard the Quaernan. It is a hybrid breeder/fusion reactor, with heat from the fission reactions being used to superheat the fusion chamber, increasing space and heat efficiency."
	description "Of course, the obvious downside is the reactor's size, taking up the same amount of space as some heavy warships."

	"heat generation" 20795.6
	description "As if the Mantle wasn't enough, the Hybrid Nuclear Core seems to be an even larger implementation of a similar system, with further heat and space-efficiency to boot. Though it's nearly double the size, it produces almost triple the power of the Mantle, with a significantly higher heat efficiency."
