	description "The missile proximity defense system is heavier-duty anti-missile turret that has a somewhat short range, but is capable of quashing a large amount of incoming missiles. However, the high volume of fire is exceedingly unsustainable, so the gun needs to cool down for twice as long as it spends firing."

	description `This is a slower-firing, longer range alternative to the gatling gun. Though low in damage and fairly inaccurate over distance, it provides a reliable spread of suppressive fire against grouped or large targets. The drones are big enough to manufacture their own ammunition, even, so there's no need to find yourself a new ammo cache.`

	description "This is a type of ion engine that can turn and thrust both forwards and backwards; it also contains an afterburner, lending shocking maneuverability to the Alpaca drones it sits on. Despite its similarity to ion engines, it is remarkably powerful for its size, especially considering all it encompasses."
