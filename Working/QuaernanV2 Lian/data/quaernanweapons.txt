	description "With such a huge ship to worry about, one might think it a good idea to amp up the anti-missile systems of the Quaernan. The original designers of the ship seemed to agree, with these huge turrets providing not only direct anti-missile fire, but also radiator coils to reduce the ship's thermal footprint as well as radar jamming mechanisms."

	description "Seemingly to compensate for the fact that the missile compensator doesn't have any extra missile countermeasures, it is instead an extremely powerful solo turret."

	description "Though the Rift Tearer is undoubtedly the main gun of the Quaernan, there's something unsettlingly final about this enormous missile rig. The launcher itself is large, albeit unimpressive; the only standout aspect of the launcher is the fact that, upon firing, the launcher imparts a fair portion of your ship's shield into the projectile, making it extremely hard to destroy."
	description "What most stands out to you, however, is the enormous production machine, designed to use unimaginable amounts of power to create and consolidate antimatter into a very real, very usable form. Out of sheer respect for (and fear of) the technology, you opt to set as many overseers as possible to the task of operation."
