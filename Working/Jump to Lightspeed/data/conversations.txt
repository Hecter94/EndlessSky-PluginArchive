	`The sounds of different air speeders fly and zoom over your head as you make your way to the banking building. A scent of exhaust is constant in the air here on Taris as the planet is predominately covered in sprawling sky scrapers. Even though the sun is out, the shade from near by towering sky scrapers and smog clouds make you feel like it's later in the day. As you slowly approach the office, looking up gives you a sense of fear of heights inside of your suit. The door, bearing the symbol of the standard “credit,” slide open and a cool breeze of air hits your face. `
	`	The loan broker's office is that of any other upper level building here on Taris. Large consoles fill the walls, with stock quotes and other information spilling down them almost too fast to read. You occasionally glimpse the names of places that you have only heard of: Mandalore. Bespin. Coruscant.`
	`	The data pad you’re handed, though almost weightless, felt heavy listing several dozen statements, notices, and agreements. The banker, a well-dressed twi’lek man in a suit that you suspect costs more than the spaceship you are about to purchase, scans through the data documents, uttering a curt, "Sign here. Now here," as he points to each page on the screen. He moves swiftly, mechanically.`
	`	The only moment when he becomes truly animated is when explaining the Truth in Lending statement to you. "You are borrowing 480,000 credits," he says, "to be repaid over the course of one year. Your daily interest rate is 0.4%, which means that your daily payments are 2503 credits, and by the end of the year you will have paid... 434,000 credits in interest. Sign here." He grins.`
	`	You sign your name one final time:`

	name
	`	The man places the data pad into a large console that later ejects credit chips. He hands you the chips and motions you to leave. But as you leave the bank, you are smiling. This crazy adventure suddenly feels real to you. You are going to do it. You are finally going to get off this planet.`
	`	Compared to the bank, you feel much more at home in the shipyard, walking among the rusted out hulks and newer ships that gleam in the sunlight. You smell grease and dirt and fuel; wonderful smells. There are three ship models within your price range. Which one you choose will determine your future...`

	"You've heard enough horror stories about the sort of accidents that happen when starship systems malfunction to be completely convinced of the necessity of a pre-flight safety check. As you listen to the complex symphony of hums, rattles, and clicks of your ship warming up, you run through a mental checklist. Computers: check. Life support: check."
	"	It is all going smoothly until it comes time to fire up the thrusters for a test run... and you realize, much to your embarrassment, that you do not have any thrusters installed. Time to head back to the outfitter and fix that!"

	"	By the time you reach the end of the checklist, it has grown uncomfortably warm. The air smells like ozone and hot metal, and your cameras are showing a plume of steam or smoke escaping from the hull near the engines. If your systems are running this hot while still in the atmosphere, they're likely to overheat the moment you hit hard vacuum. You are going to have to either install cooling systems, or trade out some components for lower-heat alternatives."
