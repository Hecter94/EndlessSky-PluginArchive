	description "The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor was a starfighter designed by the Rebel Alliance during the Galactic Civil War. One of the fastest mass-produced interceptors in the known galaxy, the A-wing was even faster than the Imperials' TIE Interceptor, despite also having shielding and a hyperdrive, unlike the cheaper TIE model.The RZ-1 A-wing interceptor was a cockpit attached to twin engines. Like its Clone Wars predecessor, the Eta-2, the A-wing required pilots of exceptional skill to take full advantage of the vessel's speed, agility, and special featuresâ€”and the Rebel Alliance lacked the Galactic Republic's Jedi pilots."

	description "The A/SF-01 B-wing heavy assault starfighter, known simply as the B-wing starfighter, was one of the largest and most heavily armed starfighters/bombers in the Rebel Alliance's fleet. The name B-wing came from the craft's appearance to a 'B', when upright, the outline of the upper half and the lower half makes a B shape, although its swordlike shape in attack mode has earned it the nickname 'Blade-wing', which may be another reason for the 'B' prefix."

To build this ship now up to modern standards is considered only to be done by the best shipwrites in the galaxy."

This new solar array design gave the Interceptor its unmistakable dagger-like appearance, while providing the pilot with increased visibility and shrinking its profile to make targeting more frustrating for enemy gunners. This wing design gave the craft a more menacing visage, continuing the Empire's reputation of ruling through fear."

	description "The TIE fighter is the original design for later upgraded TIE models such as TIE/sa bomber, TIE/IN interceptor, TIE/D Defender, TIE/D automated starfighter, and many more. The TIE Fighter was a descendant of the T.I.E. starfighter and the V-wing starfighter, both developed for the Galactic Republic, and was manufactured by Sienar Fleet Systems. In addition to the T.I.E. and V-wing, it was also descended from the TIE starfighter, the first TIE model developed for the Galactic Empire."

	description "The VCX-100 light freighter was one of the Corellian Engineering Corporation's freighter designs. A most notable example of this model was the Ghost, a modified VCX-100. The VCX-100 was designed in mind to have a seperate ship, for both space to surface landings and escape options, to add to the versatile build of the freighter. Though many still prefer the popular YT series, the VCX can compete on every level a YT model can."

	description "Decimators were used as either long-range reconnaissance units or picket ships stationed along the perimeter of Imperial fleets. However, with a full crew, Decimators can damage enemy lines, often offering an opening. Sometimes Decimators were used to break through enemy forces to deploy raiding parties. The command of a VT-49 was a point of accomplishment and pride for the middle ranks of the Imperial Navy. It was usually seen as a stepping stone on the path towards command of a capital ship."

	description "Affectionately known as a 'wishbone' to Rebel Alliance pilots, the Y-wing starfighter was deployed as a fighter-bomber, designed to fight its way to its objective, deliver its payload of high explosives, and fight its way out again. Its weaponry included two laser cannons, two ion cannons, and two proton torpedo launchers. An astromech droid, such as an R2 unit, could be plugged into a socket behind the cockpit to act as a co-pilot and manage the ship's various systems."

	description "The Z-95 Headhunter was a starfighter designed jointly by Incom and Subpro Corporations years before the Invasion of Naboo. Its resilience and longevity meant it remained a staple of private and low-priority government starfighter forces long after its introduction."
