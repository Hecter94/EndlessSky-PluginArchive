			`As you enter this strange station an creature is approaching you. It looks like an ant but you can see through it. It is shining in a lot of colors. "Welcome Human", it says, "I see another one of your race is willing to accept the challenge for the worthy?" As you look confused at it, it continues talking "I see, so you do not know what this place is?" You nod in confusion. "Then let me explain. This is one of the gateway stations to the Arena of the Worthy. It was built by my kind the Impetus. Only the best individues of every species get to this place. It was built for them to compete in the art of combat. The rewards for winning are exceptional. If you want to compete go to the spaceport."`

			`You go to the spaceport to see what exactly is offered here. Another of this ant like creatures stands at some sort of counter. "Welcome human. I see this is your first time here," it says. Confused about how it knows that fact you just nod.`
			`    "Then let me explain what all of this is about," it starts, "my kind, we call ourselves the Impetus are really advanced. You might have met the Quarg, but we are a lot more advanced than them. Now that we have reached nearly everything in normal sciences, we wanted to explore the depths of mind. But we came to a border where we could not advance further. It seemed to be a natural border of advancement. But then we discovered something. In each species there are a few persons who break the limits of their species and achieve things greater than anyone of their kind. You for example have a Jumpdrive, even though your kind did not even scratch the surface of this technology." it pauses for a second, but then contious, "So we decided to bring all of this persons together and find out who of them is the best. Therefore we created something that used the peak of our technology. The Arena of the Worthy. Here we try to find the most skilled persons and see what makes them different. Well, that is what we do. But you, you will do something entirely different. For those who reach the uppermosts ranks in this arena exceptional rewards and pieces of our technology wait.`
