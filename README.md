# Introduction

A comprehensive library of 540 ancient and new plugins for the open-source game Endless Sky.

---

# Download Information

All plugins can be downloaded directly [here](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/plugins.md) or as zip files from the [releases](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/releases/tag/Latest) page.

## Downloading Alternative

Third-party tools such as [https://download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/) can download a single folder/plugin. Paste the folder URL into that tool and you will be given a .zip file for that folder.

For example, for the "50 cal" plugin, enter: [https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/Working/50%20cal](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/Working/50%20cal)

Github, by default, only allows the entire library to be downloaded as a single .zip. GitHub may have issues downloading large file sizes; a possible workaround is using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash to clone the repository.

## Notes

- "Working" directory – plugins updated to work with the continous build of Endless Sky
- "Originals" directory – archived copies of original plugins
- "Nonfunctional" directory – plugins that will not function without updates

## Known Plugin Issues

<details>

If you find more plugin issues / conflicts please add them to 'res/plugin_issues.txt'.

### A Galaxy Far Far Away, Businessman Mod, Endless Depth, Normandy

Title screen missing/corrupted. override the title screen, using one or more of these can cause issues with it looking corrupted or "missing". Recommend to use one of these at a time, OR delete title.png from \images to restore the vanilla title screen

### Civil War, Edge of Endless, Jump to Lightspeed and Star Wars

all edit the vanilla interface, this can also cause issues and can only be fixed by editing/removing the interfaces.txt file in the plugin.

### A Wonderful Worldship

Random sprites replaced by worldships Culprit: Intended Behavior of "A wonderful worldship mod"

### Bare Ships

clears all ships from shipyards, meaning only bare versions of ships will be available, any plugins adding other ships not to custom shipyards will likely be incompatible

### Elite Sky

creates an Interceptor "bay type" which seems to make any interceptor escort jump around randomly.

### Final Frontier

sets every government swizzle to 0, also has an image named raider which conflicts with vanilla korath raider.

### Star Wars

includes a copy of vanilla data files and will likely conflict with any missions added/changed since it was created. Specifically known to conflict with changes to the Remnant storyline.

Star Wars has an image named fury which conflicts with vanilla fury.

### Recovery Ships

NPC Ships unable to assist with fuel or repairs Culprit: Likely an old version of Recovery Ship, updated 2/8/2022. Please let me know if you still see the issue.

Escorts from missions not spawning correctly Culprit: use the “safe” variant of this plugin to fix this behavior, “safe” version ships can only carry "Fighter" from vanilla and "Heavy Fighter" and "Gunship"

### The Station of Dr. Rousseau

"Bounty" Arfecta is spawned directly outside starting location. Culprit: , Mission: "Puzzle 3". No location is defined so Arfecta is spawned on first "landing".

"Hunt Dread Pirate Roberts" mission offers everywhere due to a lack of a source filter

### Edge of Endless

Overrides Luxury Accommodations and give it much higher space, bunks, and crew requirement, might make some ships that comes with it appears to have negative space and/or bunks.

Ship "Colossus" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Adamas

### ES-Restock

# Contribution

## Regarding Plugin Information

Some plugins are still missing important information, such as the author, description or current status. If you would like to help add this info, please update these by posting in the discussions area or making a Pull Request changing the files in `/res/pluginlist/`.

## Add your plugin

Do you want your plugin here? Create a Pull Request or open a new [issue](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&projects=&template=plugin-submission.yaml)

For Pull Requests, create a file with the plugin information in `/res/pluginlist/` and your plugin at `Working/`, so this README.md can get auto-generated by a script. Check the other files there to see the formatting.

If you provide a `directlink=` in the plugin file at `res/pluginlist/`, then there is no need to upload your plugin to the `Working` directory; your plugin will be uploaded automatically on the next daily check for updates. So instead of uploading a folder with a git client, you can upload a single text file with the web Interface.

## Automatic Updating

The files in `res/pluginlist/` used to generate this README.md have a line `directlink=`, where you can put a URL to your zipped plugin. The line should look like this: `directlink=https://github.com/userxyz/esplugins/releases/download/Latest/myplugin.zip` or any other directly accessible webspace.

This repository does an automated check for your direct link once a day at 23:00am UTC, and if your plugin there is newer than the one hosted here, it updates it and puts it in the news box. Please read the naming convention paragraph to prevent errors.

If you have a single plugin GitHub repo (with the data folder in the root), you can use the auto-generated zip file (green button) as a direct update link. You can fork the official plugin template repository at [https://github.com/endless-sky/plugin-template](https://github.com/endless-sky/plugin-template).

With this feature, we hope to create a centralized overview for active plugin development.

## Plugin Naming Convention

Although a lot of checking and error handling got implemented in the scripts, there might be some bugs. To be safe, try to avoid special characters in your plugin name.

We now have different paths and files addressed to the same plugin. The plugin folder is `Working/YourPlugin/`, and the information file is at `res/pluginlist/YourPlugin.txt`.<br>
To keep these files related, you must give them the same name.
