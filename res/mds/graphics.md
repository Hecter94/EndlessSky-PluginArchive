<blockquote>### additional.command.buttons <br>
<br>
Made for the mobile version and changes the interface by adding the following 10 buttons: <br> 
<ul>
<li>full stop</li>
<li>board ship</li>
<li>land on planet</li>
<li>fleet: harvest flotsam</li>
<li>fleet: hold position</li>
<li>fleet: gather around me</li>
<li>fleet: attack my target</li>
<li>fleet: toggle ammo usage</li>
<li>view player info</li>
<li>fast forward</li>
</ul>
and
<ul>
<li>adjusts the message box to not overlap</li>
<li>moved the hidden ammo box to a visible place</li>
</ul>
<br>
(inspired by theweirednut) <br>
<br>

<br>
Allthough most of these commands are now implemented in other parts to the original mobile user interface or can be accessed by gestures, I personally prefer these buttons on the lower right corner.<br>
<br>
Additional there are some functions in this plugin that the original mobile ui can't do at the moment:<br>
- board button cycles through the possibilities <br>
- fleet commands can be used for single ships when selected <br>
<br>
This plugin overwrites `interface "main buttons"` and `interface "hud"`, so it isn't compatible with other plugins modifying these.<br>
<br>
<br>

<blockquote>### landing.images.android 
<br>
<br>
Moves the landing image above the textbox, instead of behind the textbox (for ES mobile).<br>
<br>
In case parts of the UI/the buttons are outside the screen, try rescaling your UI in the ES options<br>
If that doesn't help, open the zip, edit 'landing.images.android/data/interface.txt' and change line 2 to 7 to:<br>
	image "land"
		center -60 -150
		dimensions 250 135
	sprite "ui/frame"
		center -60 -150
		dimensions 265 150
That resizes the landing image and the frame to their half.<br>

<blockquote># Realistic-Solar-System
This plugin modifies the Sol system adding every planet, large moon (over 20!) and two dwarf planets (Ceres and Pluto with its moon, Charon), each with unique sprites modified from NASA pictures taken during various missions. Everything in Sol has also been resized to a much bigger and realistic size, including the Sun itself.

In vanilla, the solar system has:
 - 5 planets
 - 5 moons
 - a 90x90 star

With this plugin, it gets:
- 8 planets
- 20 moons
- 2 dwarf planets
- a 450x450 star

And all of this with 31 unique sprites, plus other 30 high DPI ones included in the package!
