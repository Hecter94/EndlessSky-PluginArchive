>Adds some missions for the pirate worlds.

<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Arrr, Mateys!

## What is it?

A bunch of missions and stuff to give folks something to actually *do* on the pirate worlds in [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io).  Many of these things actually have an impact on pirate opinions, giving players a proper "if you can't beat 'em, join 'em" option.

## What sorts of fun things can I do?

### Which ones are already implemented?

* Smuggle illicit substances (namely: drugs) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle illicit multimedia (namely: pirated software/videos/music) out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle counterfeit goods out of pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the near future?

* Smuggle illegal immigrants out of pirate worlds
* Transport isolationists to pirate worlds
* Deliver medical supplies / luxury goods / etc. to pirate worlds
* Smuggle slaves into / out of pirate worlds
* Smuggle weapons into pirate worlds

### Which ones are planned to be implemented in the not-so-near future?

* Some pirate-centric mini-storylines (or perhaps a Pirate-centric main storyline)
* A pirate-centric alternate start (probably part of the above)

## What's the license?

GPLv3 (see `COPYING`).

>Adds some missions and jobs to increase the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships. See the readme for details.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### bunrodea.missions
<br>
<br>
This plugin adds some missions to destroy Korath ships, which enable job board missions for raising the Bunrodea reputation. The first mission is available after the vanilla first contact mission. Doing more jobs will allow you to get access to all their planets and ships.<br>
<br>
Unlocking the planets is based on reputation, so you get access step by step. Unlocking the last of the planets(with the big shipyard) needs 500 reputation.<br>
<br>
Some missions from landing/spaceport unlock jobs. Others just give reputation or unlock story progression. Each job gives 5 to 40 reputation.<br>
Averagely you have to do like 50 jobs, less if you take the fighting jobs. Like in vanilla play, hit spaceport often.<br>
<br>
Since it's often questioned, here is a guide to the bunrodea first contact mission: Travel through Bunrodea territory till you've killed at least one Bunrodea ship, then fly to a human system (Misam works), land there and you get a mission, that brings you back to the Bunrodea. You can land on 4 planets now, and at this point this plugin starts.<br>
<br>
If the plugin control.station is installed, it gives additional information about the missions and shows this README.<br>

<blockquote># A Coalition at War

You hear a lot about the conflict between the Coalition and the Quarg in Endless Sky, but you never see it. This plugin introduces a storyline that lets you see or join that conflict. You gain access to Quarg or Heliarch tech and warships depending on the side you choose.

You can start the first mission by landing on "Tebuteb's Table" (in the Tebuteb system) or Forpelog (in the Sadalsuud system) and accepting the anomaly mission.

This plugin is best enjoyed after finishing the Wanderer Campaign. Getting access to Tier 3 tech makes everything else basically irrelevant.

There's few missions right now. See "Contributing" below if you have any ideas for more missions.

# Getting Started

## Installing

1. Download the plugin here: [https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases](https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases)

2. Put the zip file in your plugins folder:

Windows: `%APPDATA%\endless-sky\plugins/`

Mac: `/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins/`

Linux: `/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

3. Decompress/"Unzip" the zip file.
4. Start Endless Sky. You should be able to see "A Coalition at War" under Preferences > Plugins.
5. If you have problems, open an issue: https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/issues/new/choose

## Using

Land on Tebuteb's Table or Forpelog and you will be asked to investigate an anomaly. Accept the mission and you'll be on your way.

<blockquote># cognitive-subdivision
This plugin has been discontinued.

A mod for Endless Sky. Takes place right around the start of the second half of the Wanderer storyline

The story involves two main factions, the Algol and the Hand of Eden, as well as some vanilla factions like the Coalition, Hai Unfettered, and of course Humanity.
The player will have to aid the Algol in various tasks throughout the current campaign.

# Development Status
It is currently a Beta plugin.

* A medium WIP (work in progress) plugin
* Story is not fully implemented but for most of the part, it is
* Spaceport and planets descriptions are not fully done
* Quarg-Pug Expansion not finished
* Ember Watse/Remnant/Dark Expansion not finished
* Many more civilizations expansions to do
* Outfits and ships descriptions are not fully done.
* The whole 'Empire Rebels' part is not started very yet. (check [wiki](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/Governments-&-Major-Factions))
* The [wiki](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/wiki/) still in work and most of the Gameplay section is outdated
* The Lumbarian Empire is currently in a very early stage. Help create the storyline [here](https://github.com/OcelotWalrus/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/discussions/117)

# System requirements
Endless Sky has very minimal system requirements, meaning most systems should be able to run the game. But this plugin is kind of heavy.
It is also important that you play using the **latest unstable beta version of Endless Sky**, the main branch of the official [Endless Sky repository](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky).

|| Minimum | Recommended |
|---|----:|----:|
|RAM | 4 GB | 8 GB |
|Graphics | OpenGL 3.0 | OpenGL 3.3 |
|Storage Free | 900 MB | 3 GB |

## Known issues
  * Game sometimes crash when loading resources (don't have enough RAM)
  * Some outfits or ships don't have texture: it's because we're currently revamping them (the textures to be revamped are in [images/_TEMP/](https://github.com/Cromha-Plugins/Cromha-Expansion-plugin/tree/main/images/_TEMP))

<blockquote># Enigma Corp
Enigma Corp is an ever expanding mod that takes you through the adventures of the Enigma Corporation, a strange and greedy corporation that has only just recently surfaced onto the open market and is already doing big things. Both an outfit development and ship creation company, the Corporation has taken the market by storm, introducing new and exciting things to the general public that have never been seen before.

Although, some say that Enigma Corp's rise to power was not done cleanly, claiming that they steal secrets from other companies in order to gain an unfair edgy on their competitors. And rumor has it that they have dark connections with alien races, allowing them to develop the amazing things that they do that recently seemed out of humanity's grasps. But are these rumors true? Only you can find out!

Enjoy playing with dozens of new outfits and multiple new ships, as well as exploring the over 40 new systems that this mod adds in the Milky Way alone. That's right! There's more than just the Milky Way in this mod! Where will your travels take you? Find out today!

<blockquote># epic-trucker

Plugin for Endless Sky https://endless-sky.github.io/

This plug-in adds additional cargo and passenger (and both at once) missions to the game increasing the scale and scope for a player who wants to focus on running a huge trucker shipping delivery passenger service.

Please check "Releases" for functional releases - whatever is currently in source may be a work in progress. I release code when it is in a stable, tested state so check there!

-=-=-=-
Fluff
-=-=-=-

Alright you gear-jamming hyperspace truckers, this message is brought to you by your good ol' boys at Meganthium Trucking Company, THE Mega Truck Co. Find yourself doing a lot of shopping and price comparison trying to fill up all that cargo space? Maybe you've found gravy town and got yourself a little convoy and are ready to move up to the big leagues? Well we at Mega Truck Co. have you covered. Bigger jobs for a big galaxy. Get your cargo and passenger space up high enough and you'll start getting bigger and larger jobs with more bonus payout. With around fifty billion humans making and taking, it has never been a better time to be a trucker, hauler, ferry, or cabby. 

Why not go into the big leagues and find yourself some truely EPIC deliveries to fulfill? These special missions come co-sponsored by yours truely, Max Hammer, CEO, Mega Truck Co. These enormous, mega, and epic missions are all high-risk. You'll run into corporations looking to get even or just level the competition. You might even get targetted by the biggest and bravest pirates around who want to steal all that cargo. You aren't just hauling big volume; I need you to keep that cargo safe!

-=-=-=-
Features:
-=-=-=-

Additional jobs which become unlocked with higher cargo and passenger count. These are copies of the vanilla jobs with a few tweaks to both increase minimums and push the maximum sizes way up - and also their default bonuses. After all, hiring you to do it in one saves them on logistics. There are also more jobs for moving criminals (needs the brig) and more for wealthy patrons (needs luxury) and added one or two fun little but high payout jobs such as a wealthy enthusiast who wants to brag about having gotten a ride with such a legendary captain! (Requires high net-worth)

Right now these extra jobs should come into a vanilla campaign over time as you grow your fleet, either with many haulers or just a couple huge rigs. Most of these jobs are slightly more rare to cut down on job-overload. For now though, once you're an epic trucker you will see nearly 50% more jobs each day.

*Existing Compatible*
This can be safely added or removed from an existing game. I've tested this myself on Windows and Ubuntu (Linux) only. When adding, you won't see new jobs until you land again (if you're already landed it won't prompt to check for new jobs until you take off). If you remove it, you will keep whatever jobs you have as they're part of your save file -- you will just stop seeing these jobs (again, only once you take off). 

*Mod Compatible*
This should work with any other mods because this only adds jobs and does not try to tweak existing stuff. 
Once we add any overrides to phase out vanilla shipping, however, this will become more complicated. This isn't implemented yet.

-=-=-=-
Installation Instructions: 
-=-=-=-

Download the ZIP file and extract it into your plugins folder. 
Alternately, you can just git clone directly into the plugins folder
Make sure you are only one folder with the name of the mod which directly contains the "data" folder - if you're two levels deep the plugin loader wont find and load the plugin.

You'll know it is working if you have over 200 cargo or 6 passengers and you see missions with "Bigger" "Larger" "Many" "A Big Family" and similar things in their name

-=-=-=-
Future:
-=-=-=-

* Override for existing main jobs to phase them out over time as your cargo + passengers + net worth go up. 
* Add 3rd tier of mega jobs and have them phase in over time as the big ones also phase out. No one wants to be cluttered with "deliver 5 tons" when you're doing "deliver 2200 tons" and the job system can get overloaded and noisy.
* More jobs for cargo + passengers from special regions, like corporate retreat for 200+ people, or help setup a colony 1000tons and 100 people
* High Risk job line which requires certain net worth and combat rating on top of cargo and passenger which involves turbo pirate and later, ELITE enemies
* Deep, Syndicate, and FW specific jobs
* Eliminating Large Industry Transport Executives - ELITE Pirate force as special antagonists using large pools of vessels including checking for modded ones to be the antagonists for EPIC jobs
* Mega Truck Co. HQ with special mission line and some cute custom loadouts for basic haulers, freighters, etc as well as the atomic fusion bactrian "MEGA TRUCK" rig just for fun, nothing game breaking nor outside of vanilla game
* Extra banter from merchants and major factions once you've completed EPIC or MEGA jobs which allows setting to appear to be aware you are a truely epic trucker

One of the greatest manufacturers in human space (in their own opinion) is Fire Corporation. They produce several ships for civilian and military uses.
If you were worried about fighting pirates using their ships, you don't have to worry; that's what they do.
They will offer you jobs to hunt down pirates who took their ships, or even their outfits.

<blockquote>### gegno.pirates
<br>
<br>
Adds a new faction of Gegno pirates which lets you capture Gegno ships, gain Gegno/Scin/Vi reputation, open their planets for travel, loot Gegno licenses and create an outfitter/shipyard for all their gear.<br>
<br>
The new government "Gegno Pirates" (hidden till vanilla gegno story is done) inhabit the new System "Zaron"(between Huud, Vesvii and Cotpoxi). The surrounding systems, up to 3 jumps away, have new pirate fleets.<br>
Killing pirates and assisting Gegno/Scin/Vi gives reputation now. The needed reputation to land on the Gegno planets got changed to higher values. Killing like 80 Gegno pirates should allow you to land on all Gegno planets and use their shipyards and outfitters.<br>
Boarding Gegno Pirates gives you a 5% chance to obtain one of the 8 Gegno licenses.<br> 
After gaining full reputation for all planets and obtaining all Gegno licenses you get a mission to a new system with all outfitters/shipyards centralized.<br>
<br>

<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Notice: 2023-06-27

I don't play Endless Sky very much anymore. I used to maintain this plugin because it was fun. But now I realize the many issues it has; such as the inherent implausibility of the factions such as the CSSF and Sayari Plushie Authority; the space LEEST uses for systems being taken up by new pull requests. It was great by 2021 standards for me, but in the two years since I have improved at an exponential rate and moved away from Endless Sky.

If I ever returned to Endless Sky and wanted to make plugins; it is likely I would start from scratch and call it LEEST 2.

- Lemuria

## Extra Notice: 2024-10-19

This repository has been unarchived after I decided to start playing Endless Sky again. However, this interest might be short-lived and only last a few days or weeks, but nonetheless it might be long enough to fix the plugin's typos and other issues.

# About

- Planet/ship/character/any names with innocent meanings in English but vulgar meanings in other languages are rare (the author has not gotten any complaints). Any such meanings are unintended. Please contact the author if you have a problem.

# Let's play! (Installation instructions)

## Download

### Windows
* Copy the Lemurias-Extra-ES-Stuff-main.zip file into `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins`.
* Unzip the file.
* Remove the Lemurias-Extra-ES-Stuff-main.zip, if you want to.

### macOS
* Extract the zip to `/Users/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins`. Or `Application Support`, depending on your version.

### Linux
The preferred way to install on Linux is to `cd $HOME/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins && git clone https://github.com/a-random-lemurian/Lemurias-Extra-ES-Stuff`. Updating is easy, just run `git pull`. We're assuming you know how to use a terminal here, by the way.

Or, you can just download the zip and extract it to `/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins`.

### Verify installation

* Click on the Plugins tab.
* If you see "Lemuria's Extra Endless Sky Stuff", the plugin has been installed correctly.
* Go forth and play.

## Sayari disclaimer

This Endless Sky plugin may contain traces of the Hai ambassador "Sayari". Exposure to Sayari may result in the following effects: Simping, being targeted by Yuyuko Saigyouji, being killed by Yuyuko Saigyouji, insomnia due to thinking about Sayari and Endless Sky constantly at night, gaming addiction.

Additional effects include a cease and desist letter from anti-gaming groups (rare), and for developers, overload of any MongoDB databases, bill shock if GitHub autopay is on and price is based upon your use of storage and computing power, being denied access to APIs and web services due to storing excessive photos of Sayari, writing too much code that keeps track of Sayari, sending too many requests for a search for Sayari, and excessive posting of Sayari images to aforementioned web services (Stack Overflow, Discord, animal forums, r/aww, r/squirrel, subreddits related to squirrels) respectively.

<blockquote># Main Plot Plus
[![Check Files](https://github.com/ziproot/endless-sky-main-plot-plus/actions/workflows/check-files.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ziproot/endless-sky-main-plot-plus/actions/workflows/check-files.yml)

A plugin for the video game “endless sky” mostly centered around improving the main plot.

## Guided Start
This is an optional feature that can be enabled or disabled upon creating a new save or loading an existing one with this plugin installed for the first time. If you haven't chosen sides in the human civil war by July 3017, Guided Start will allow you to join the Free Worlds, and also the Syndicate if you have the Crisis in Management plugin installed. It will additionally allow you to remain neutral (see below). Any conditions blocking the campaigns from starting will be cleared. If you enter the spaceport, a map indicator will lead you to the planet to get started and remind you to enter the spaceport if necessary.

## Fast Forward
This is a start two years later than the present. To unlock it, you must have made it to the point where Fast Forward begins. It automatically reveals all of human space and puts you in Wayfarer with no loan and enough credits to buy an Osprey. Since it is two years later, you can immediately start doing the free worlds prologue missions, but you are also unable to do pact recon.

## Neutrality
You can choose to remain neutral in the human civil war. To do this, just play the game normally without choosing sides, then when asked what side you are on, say that you are neutral. When pressed, continue to remain neutral. Shortly after, land on any world one jump away from a Pug planet and tell the Pug that you are neutral, and you will be able to skip the main plot. However, there's a catch: a different pilot will do the free worlds campaign instead, and they will choose checkmate. If you want the reconciliation ending, join the Syndicate with the Crisis in Management plugin or join the Free Worlds and choose reconciliation. The missions are designed so that you will be relocated to Ruin and time will advance by several years, but this is waiting on several pull requests to be merged, so at the moment you will have to use your imagination. Your reward for completing Neutrality is a subsidurial pet.

### Compatibility
Neutrality should be compatible with most major missions in the base game. You are told about the Pug war, the Free Worlds having nuclear weapons, and some of the new outfits produced by humanity: the plasma turret, flamethrower, s-970 regenerator, s-270 regenerator, ionic afterburner, typhoon torpedo launcher, electron beam, and catalytic ramscoop. This isn't everything, as it excludes the stack core due to it not being sold by Kraz Cybernetics, but it is enough to cover everything in the Coalition intros. You also learn about the Oathkeepers, and you assist Danforth by taking out a pirate fleet, unlocking the Wanderers campaign. From there, you can start Hai Reveal through Fiona and Rain, as the pirate fleet happened to have Hai weapons. I have additionally patched a mission that assumes you know Alondo.

## Road to Hai Reveal
Hai Reveal is still in a work in progress state. Additionally, it at the moment requires you to specifically join the Free Worlds, or none of the missions after the leak will offer. As a result, I have a series of missions called “Road to Hai Reveal” that will allow you to do the intro of Hai Reveal if you have done Neutrality. I have also patched all the post-war reactions, see below. I have set it up so that you meet Alondo, which should allow the rest of Hai Reveal to work without issue if it gets merged as-is. If it gets changed to be more campaign agnostic, that still works and you can go down the free worlds path.

### Post War Reactions
The post-war reactions by default all assume you have directly fought with the Pug, which isn't necessarily true in Crisis in Management and definitely isn't true in the Neutrality option. I have replaced all three of these with patch missions which vary depending on how you interacted with the Pug, based on this plugin, the vanilla Free Worlds Reconciliation branch, and Crisis in Management. It also tries to test if you have done the vanilla version of Free Worlds Checkmate instead, if needed. I also removed a stupid section about the Free Worlds and Navy captains joking about almost killing each other, and I have reverted the gender of a character in War Reactions: Syndicate Orphan because MasterofGrey says that the change was not justified. Other than that, doing Free Worlds should result in the same post-war reactions as vanilla, but doing Crisis in Management or the Neutrality option will give you different outcomes that make sense for what you've done.

## Syndicate
The Syndicate will now use their new technology on their ships if you complete the main plot, though they still won't sell it to you if you did reconciliation. The weights of the variants are based on the ones for the republic Mark II ships. A few of the Mark II variants are used in vanilla for a few missions in the reconciliation branch, but I added a bunch more so that all the Syndicate ships used in their main fleets have Mark II variants. The Syndicate rarely uses nuclear missiles before the war in the eastern parts of the Core, where they get raided by the Korath. They stop in 3014 because of the impending war.

### Test Dummies
Do you know those test dummy missions that you have to do? Well, there's a reason for them. Amazinite's Checkmate improvements include “automatic” ships. I have added these ships to occasionally show up in the Syndicate fleets after the main plot. They are essentially the same as the normal “mark II” ships, except that they have a special government that can change hails to use the test dummy ones, they cannot be bribed, they have the same confusion as the target practice jobs, they have the “automaton” and “self-destruct” attributes from the jobs, they are always called “Syndicate Test Vessel,” and, being expensive, try to avoid battle and run away if threatened. Speaking of the test dummies, you can no longer fight them after the main plot, as the Syndicate has moved to the next phase of their testing and has started to incorporate them in their fleet.

## Improved Checkmate
Amazinite had, a long time ago, added changes that improved the Checkmate branch, that ultimately didn't go anywhere, other than some changes in the first part of the campaign rework. These changes will likely be added as part of the next parts of the campaign rework. However, as I am a fan of the Checkmate branch already, I think more people should be doing it, so I am incorporating these changes now, along with some minor fixes. Mostly, these allow you to ask about progress made by the Syndicate in finding the terrorists, and eventually allow you to “fight” them with automatic ships after the Pug invasion. This updated plot is referenced in the Neutrality option, mentioning the Syndicate finding the “terrorists” and the automatic vessels being used as cannon fodder.

### Nuclear Missile (Mark II)
I am also changing one major thing: the nuke launcher is three times smaller, but it now launches “mark II nuclear missiles,” which are essentially the buffed nuclear missiles proposed by Azure3141, but with ionization damage. When these begin being sold, the Syndicate also begin using them instead of regular nukes in a new “Mark II Nuclear” loadout in the systems raided by the Korath. This Manta loadout has two nuclear launch bays holding four mark II missiles, and two sidewinder missile launchers holding 90 sidewinder missiles, the latter of which ensure that the Mantas use the “missile boat” AI, making them less likely to blow themselves up. The old nuclear missiles are 10x cheaper than the nuclear missiles in vanilla are, i.e. they cost 100,000 credits each instead of a million credits each. The nuclear launch bay costs 1 million credits, but each mark II nuke only costs 80,000 credits and can load two nukes, and you can restock from any outfitter via 0.10.13’s system. There is not a storage container for nukes as each one takes up weapon and outfit space directly, which is the main reason why the nuclear launch bay takes up so little outfit space on its own. However, you can still add one ton nuclear installation chips to *load* additional nukes. This is required mainly so that the game can let you refill to whatever target you want without you having to manually rebuy the nukes yourself.

## Other Changes

### Other Free Worlds Changes
The FW Albatross 2A mission requires you to fight Ryk Bartlett, essentially like a bounty mission, however, instead of using the Bounty government, Ryk Bartlett uses the Pirate government, allowing you to just wait for friendly ships to take the ship out. This replaces the government for Ryk Bartlett in that mission with the Bounty government. Additionally, the longest Han Sizer Month job now gives a brief paragraph of flavor text, made by Zitchas, once you land on the final planet before heading to your destination.

### Deep Science Drones
0.10.5 added the sunder and mining drones, so I decided that it was time to allow you to get your own science drones! Some time after you do project hawking, Valhalla and Asgard will begin selling a drone variant of the aerie along with science drones, and a fleets consisting of an aerie with two science drones will begin to travel around the Deep. You will know this happens when you see an advertisement for a science drone upon entering a shipyard that sells it. A few months later, miners will begin using the drone variant with mining drones to mine. The aerie drone variant is also occasionally used by the pirate fleet in road to hai reveal.

### Author Ships
Author ships no longer fine you, because they aren’t canon, with the exception of Captain Pester because she’s Captain Pester.

### Security Analyses and Blueberry1vom1t’s Discount Paint Plugin
I have included Blueberry1vom1t’s “Discount Paint Plugin,” which you can toggle on or off, allowing you to change the swizzle of your ship via the job board. I have also included jobs in nearly every populated planet that allow to see your armament deterrance, cargo attraction, and local reputation, which changes based on what I think makes the most sense, but is usually the planetary government or is mentioned in the job description. The main exceptions are the Avgi systems, which are dependent on hidden planet attributes that determine which faction the planet is likely to be aligned with, however, landing on a non tangled shroud planet will get you the generic Avgi reputation, while landing on a twilight guard or dissonance planet will get you twilight guard or angry dissonance reputation. Landing on Weledos will give you the Avgi consonance reputation, and landing on any other Consonance planet in the tangled shroud will get you the Avgi dissonance reputation.

## Bugs
I have playtested this plugin and fixed any bugs, edge cases, and warnings I could find. There may still be bugs, and bug reports and pull requests fixing bugs are welcome.

## Uninstalling
Most changes made by this plugin should be automatically reverted when the plugin is uninstalled or disabled. One exception is the Neutrality plotline, where if you uninstall or disable the plugin while in the middle of that plotline, you will be unable to finish the main plot, Hai Reveal, or Wanderers. If you have not finished Neutrality and Road to Hai Reveal, you will probably have to revert your save, as Hai Reveal normally requires you to complete Free Worlds. I do not recommend uninstalling or disabling Main Plot Plus if you are in the middle of the Neutrality or Road to Hai Reveal plotlines.

## Other Plugins and Forks
My plugin takes the Crisis in Management plugin into account as much as possible, with the exception of Road to Hai Reveal. This means you still cannot do Hai Reveal if you did Crisis in Management. It also used to contain a patch to prevent the Constellations plugin from softlocking the game, but recent versions of this plugin no longer have the issue, so the patch has been removed, and loading this plugin should result in the patch also being reverted. This is because the patch would remove the wormhole if the plugin gets disabled/uninstalled, which I think is worse than old versions of one plugin breaking.

### Mega Freight Battles
Mega Freight Battles conflicts with Main Plot Plus. This was something I was initially working around, however, Saugia has nerfed the Free Worlds battles and especially made the fleets in those battles smaller. Therefore, I have nerfed my versions of the battles, and opted not to support Mega Freight Battles. This is because Mega Freight Battles makes the fleets even bigger, which is contrary to Saugia’s goal of reducing fleet size, and therefore is not something I will be supporting any longer. If you have Mega Freight Battles, you CAN use this plugin, however, the following missions may be one or the other due to conflicts and race conditions:

Conflicting missions:
```
FW Defend New Tibet (patched)
FW Liberate Delta Sagitarii (patched)
FWC Attack Kaus Borealis (patched)
```

## Copyright
This was originally donated to the public domain, however, I am not sure if I am allowed to do that given that I have copied text from a work licensed under the GPL v3 or later. I have relicensed it under the GPL to make sure that I am not violating any rules. I would therefore recommend following the GPL v3 anyways.

## Note on Breaking Changes
I have made a full release, which means that there will be no more “breaking” changes. For those who just downloaded the beta or full release, I still make no guarantees, but I will try to prevent save issues from now on. Note that I still may rename missions, for instance, but I will provide patch missions, whereas before this wasn't the case. However, those playing before the release will likely have to go through breaking changes when updating to a release branch, including, but not limited to, renaming the plugin, renaming files, removing files, reorganizing files, splitting files, merging files, and modifying data files without providing patch missions or other backwards compatibility features. For those who tested out my plugin before release, thank you, but treat this like you would the “continuous” branch of Endless Sky, except for updates after the release, and do not be surprised if you end up with broken saves. Remember, there is no warranty.

<blockquote># Midnight-Scrapyard

A plugin suggesting an epilogue for the Kor Sestor region of Endless Sky.

This region of space has abandoned derelicts waiting to be scavenged. But something lurks amongst the wreckage...

Highlights

- Korath "scrapper" faction
- new invasive life form
- some new missions
- a pet that accompanies your fleet into battle
- two unique boarding weapons
- Korath equivalent of "Marauder" Raiders
- new ships and ship variants
- new outfits
- a shipyard opens for the Kor Efret
- an infestation that threatens to expand beyond the Scrapyard

Note: Most of this content requires that the player completed the Wanderer storyline content (Endless Sky ver.0.9.16)

<blockquote># navy-conscript

This is a work in progress plug-in that will provide the player a choice to join The Republic Navy instead of The Free Worlds Militia.

So far only the core events, and some other components have been added. There are very few missions at this point in time and the Plug-in does not have parity with the Militia main quest.

# Contributors wanted!

**Story Line Needed**

I envisioned three rank tier's for conscript. The Tier's consist of:

**Tier I** starts off collecting surveillance and fights pirates in the north. The Lore here has an emphasis on capturing ships and assisting damaged navy ships. This initial phase is to help the player build up their fleet. Tier I then moves to collecting surveillance in the south discovering the moon where the nuclear tests were performed which earns rank of Tier II.

**Tier II** Tier II is war in the south. It will involve capturing systems, destroying some southern pirates that are plundering border republic worlds. This tier will also have the Alpha attack.

**Tier III** Tier III will be the Syndicate investigation and the Pug Invasion.

I want to keep tier II and tier III story lines lined up with the main story but of course they will be from the perspective of The Republic/Navy and of course the navy will win.

<br>
The mission can get started with 550,000 credits cash available. You have to pay 50,000 credits for making the contact and 500,000 credits for each of the four licenses.<br>
If you reject the mission, you can restart it on other visits. Also not buying all licenses lets the buying mission on Geminus restart on other landings (until all are bought).<br>
You get the following licenses: Navy license, Navy Auxiliary license, Navy Cruiser license, Navy Carrier license.<br>

<blockquote># Old-Memory

## Disclaimer
A restoration of Old Memory, a plugin for Endless Sky that's unfinished. Meant only for archival purposes and to make it playable.
With the recent addition of ship categories and spinal mounts, some ships and weapons have been changed to be more in line with what they were originally envisioned to be. This includes category changes, and larger weapons requiring spinal mounts. All other balance issues persist and will remain unchanged, unless someone wants to step in and estimate the costs or tweaks to overpowered attributes. The only changes I (the creator of the plugin) will make are those to make the plugin function with the current release of the game. There will be no further development for this plugin on my behalf, but anyone is free to adopt and expand on the ideas in it if they want to.

## Synopsis
A glimpse into the memories of the old ones. Meet new aliens, fight pirates, pick a side, or play it safe as you uncover the buried secrets of Old Memory.

<br>
<br>
This is a storyline entirely on a planets surface(with fitting visuals). Available at the outfitter on planet Memory.<br>
<br>
This is a proof of concept of an idea by Epsil-Astra.<br>
Basically a planet in a starsystem is a wormhole to a starsystem with changed background, to look like a ground map. The planets there look like cities. The galaxy background is a single whole planet. It simulates travelling on a planet you've landed on. Other starsystems act as different bioms, like forest, desert, sea.<br>
Beside showing the concept there is a storyline, 9 cities/outpost, 9 areas with 3 different bioms.<br>

<br>
<br>
A bunch of side missions which reward unique pets. <br>
<br>
Lore-friendly, totally useless, but cute pet outfits, with storylines. All missions have a 20% chance of appearing, except xenomorph and exotic mission which have 100%.<br>
<ul>
<li>Xenomorph - land somewhere in human space, hidden destination is Danoa system (based on the Alien movies)</li>
<li>The Exotic - land somewhere in human space, hidden destination is Unagi system (based on the Dark Star movie)</li>
<li>Cat - mission found on Deadman's Cove (Almach)</li>
<li>Ferret - mission found on Bivrost (Markeb)</li>
<li>Hamster - mission found on Twinstar (Alniyat)</li>
<li>Koala - mission found on New Portland (Delta Sagittarii)</li>
<li>Ocelot - mission found on Farpoint (Alnitak) needs 1000 combat rating</li>
<li>Rabbit - mission found on Starcross (Acrux)</li>
<li>Raccoon - mission found on Foundry (Achernar)</li>
<li>Squirrel - mission found on Heartvalley (Io Lowe, Hai space)</li>
</ul>
After collecting them all(except the two movie pets), you get a mission (20%) with unique reward.<br>

>SpaceCrate adds planet X-283N1 in the Alpha Centauri system. A rapidly developing world obsessed with trade and exports. Ship workers and raw materials in bulk to the planet. Export everything they produce.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---THANKS FOR TRYING SPACECRATE A SILLY BUT SERIOUS ATTEMPT TO ADD CONTENT TO ENDLESS SKY!---
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- WHAT TO EXPECT FROM SPACECRATE

SpaceCrate is a trade mod focused on lucrative deals from a trade planet perspective.
In Alpha Centauri you'll find a rich planet called X-283N1 whose people are obsessed with
trade and exports. An implied silly 'narrative' exists appointing Arnan (me) as its CEO
running the place. The people on X-283N1 love trade and exports so much that they have no
time for petty politics. All they want is to ship stuff to the galaxy. And they're willing
to pay.

Their obsession with exports requires a lot of imports as well. Notably raw materials. You
will find Bulk Deliveries aimed at X-283N1 throughout many systems, as well as prospecting
passengers who want to travel to the planet to find a new career. This in turn results in
shipments of all sizes being ready for export. Higher paying and more challenging jobs are
unlocked as your reputation and combat rating goes up.

You gain reputation with SpaceCrate Inc. by doing jobs and to some extend killing pirates.
Once your reputation is sufficiently high CEO Arnan sends out a recruiter to give you a job
with a salary through a basic story line. Completing the story line successfully will
unlock employee missions, which are larger and riskier jobs normally reserved for the inner
circle of SpaceCrate.

Other than a few illicit jobs you will not find fighting missions or other combat related
activities in this plugin as that is not what this mod is for. Instead the mod relies on
already available mechanics to create a (pirate) threat for your growing merchant fleet.
The planet does have a sizable defense force that will attack you like a bunch of mad
pirates should you contest the planet. Some jobs require a combat rating to be offered.

You'll see CEO Arnan fly in and around Alpha Centauri in his ship 'StarGoose' encouraging
you to visit his planet and make some money. Regular trade fleets can be seen flying near
Alpha Centauri sometimes with witty remarks or hints about the various jobs and perks
SpaceCrate has to offer.

SpaceCrate is a bit of an experiment with how the plugin system works.

Post your experience on the repo: https://github.com/adegans/SpaceCrate/discussions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- BALANCING

If you find any balancing issues, for example ridiculous rewards or shipments that never fit
into your hold... Let me know. I'm making things up as I go along and some of the numbers
don't mean a whole lot to me, yet!

Post your concerns on the repo: https://github.com/adegans/SpaceCrate/discussions

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- INSTALLATION

Download and extract the zip file for SpaceCrate for example to your desktop of downloads folder.
Move the extracted folder in the plugins directory for your endless sky installation.

/Library/Application Support/endless-sky/plugins

On Linux:
/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/

<blockquote># Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky, v0.2

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

## Current status

Intro and part 2/4 finished: Runs up almost to the point of the Free Worlds choice to side with the defector or Syndicate

- Plus the main side-plot for part I, and some side jobs

I've written the story outline for the rest, up to the end of the civil war, but not written it into the game yet: that's To Be Continued.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky. You probably already know how. If not, let me know, and I'll get round to updating this readme with the instructions.

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the continuous build in the main Endless Sky project.

<blockquote># Crisis in Management, a Syndicate Storyline for Endless Sky

v0.9

This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

> Leave your failing company and take to the stars to escape repercussions, then find yourself in the background, behind the scenes of Endless Sky's main storyline.  
> Beyond that, the same, endless, sky awaits.

## How to play/install

First play Endless Sky (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/). I recommend playing the main version first, up to the end of the main Free Worlds storyline. This alternate-start's intro is not as helpful for beginners, and maybe the story is more fun if you already know what's happening on the Free Worlds side... or, maybe it's fun the other way around! Good point! Well, up to you then.

To play, download this repository (or a release folder) into your plugins directory for Endless Sky, or install with ESLauncher2 (available there soon I hope).

You need Endless Sky minimum version 0.9.15, which at time of writing is the most recent release. If perchance you're playing this in the future and it doesn't work any more, please let me know and I'll try to fix it for current release.

## Current status

Approximately complete. There are a few things I want to improve sometime (feel free to help speed that up by telling me how much you loved... or hated but want to love, the plugin). For that and for bug reports you can open an issue or discussion on Github, or dig through the files to find my email address.

## Contribution and Copying

Many thanks to everyone at Endless Sky, without whom this wouldn't make a lot of sense, and would never have happened. Special thanks to samrocketman who gave advice on tidying up the licence and things.

Images are thanks to Michael Zahniser and Becca Tommaso (see copyright file).

The text of this I release into the public domain. While, if you publish an altered version of this story I'd appreciate if you let me know or even ask me first; but I place no legal restrictions on this and have waived my copyright.

>
