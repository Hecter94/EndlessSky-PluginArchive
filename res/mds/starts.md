>Alternate start with Lampyrid ship.
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># ES_Lampyrid_Start
Have you ever wanted to start Endless Sky flying something a bit more unique than the typical shuttle, starbarge, or sparrow? Have you dreamed of having a pilot that starts their career with an old ship they've been fixing up for the past few years? Well, Lampyrid Start does that. 

Choosing this starts has your pilot start their career flying a slightly modified version of the Lampyrid, which is a decent balanced transport/freighter with the capacity to be fairly fast compared to others of its class.

Be warned, however, that all is not peace, prosperity, and clear skies: Despite the tweak adding an anti-missile turret to the Lampyrid, it has sufficient cargo capacity to attract pirates on a semi-regular basis. Possibly even on your first launch. So you will have to be alert, and probably need to see about either upgrading your ship to be faster; or replacing the AM with a more intimidating turret.

So long as you can avoid the pirates, this will be an easier and faster start than the standard ones. The pirate risk can make it a little riskier and slightly more challenging, though. Just think of them as Reavers, and it'll be just like flying in the Firefly universe.

This plugin adds four starts:
- Normal start, which is identical to the usual new pilot experience except starting with a "Lampyrid Mk. III" ship.
- 3011 start, which is identical to the normal start, except you start one year early. This means you have a year to get used to the galaxy before the war starts.
- 3010 start, which is identical to the normal start, except you start two years early.
- 3011 no-loan start. This start has you begin a year early compared to the default ES new game, and instead of starting with a loan, you just have 10k credits and your "Lampyrid Mk. III" spaceship.
- The Deep start. This is intended to be on par with the default start, just that you start in the Deep instead of the Dirt Belt.
- The Paradise start. This is an easier start, without the pressure of a mortgage to pay off and startinng in a safer area.
- The South start. This is a harder start in a more dangerous area.

>In this mod you start as a member of a poor farming community on one of the Pirate worlds. Your village has just been massacred by a rogue band of pirate raiders, yet you have managed to steal one of their ships and escape. You have a chance to seek justice, wealth, or perhaps bring true political change to the Pirate worlds.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># pirate-planets
## A mod with a new start and storyline for endless-sky

The pirate worlds have always been an essential part of the Republic,
necessary and despised at the same time. They take the pressure off
inner-world jails by providing a place for scoundrels and
ne'er-do-wells to flee, and they provide a convenient place for
wealthy, inner-world aristos to conduct less-than-legal
business. Savvy operators in the Pirate worlds have understood that
this was their role since before the Republic even existed, and have
always been sure to offer a quiet marketplace where law-abiding
citizen can buy drugs, slaves, and other things their neighbors
wouldn't approve of. In return, these Pirate world operators, half
crime-lord and half medieval warlord, can rest secure in the knowledge
that they are too useful to the Paradise worlds to ever face any
serious attempt to bring them to justice.

It's a win-win scenario - for everyone but the people of the Pirate
worlds.  Theirs is a life of hard labor and a precarious existence,
where the will of the local Warlord is absolute.

In this mod you start as a member of a poor farming community on one
of the Pirate worlds. Your village has just been massacred by a rogue
band of pirate raiders, yet you have managed to steal one of their
ships and escape. You have a chance to seek justice, wealth, or
perhaps bring true political change to the Pirate worlds.

## Notice

This is a work in progress, and is not necessarily fully playable
yet. Install it at your own risk.

The space shuttle has lots of cargo space and a drone bay, but few weapons.

It has an Afterburner.

"You were born on New Boston, but moved to Earth at a young age. You've dreamed of owning a starship ever since your first visit to the spaceport at the age of fifteen. A few years later, your dream came true when you got a bargain on an old Earth relic that was up for auction. After many years working at a textile mill, you've finally saved enough credits to fix the shuttle, but there's still a debt to pay off."
