<blockquote># I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods
Includes the ships, missions, and outfits I have or will create. Features unique and original endless sky ideas and original assets created by me.

Please note that as of this time I do not consider this mod pack ready for public use. By using this mod you are automatically a Beta tester. This mod may break your game save, not function as expected, or destroy the universe... who knows.

My ships:

![Captured Archon](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/archborg.png?raw=true)

An Archon captured by the syndicate and fitten with control devices and modified weaponery. Fortunatly the syndicate was unable to access the most powerful of the Drak weaponery but this is still a fearsome weapon in the wrong hands.

![Tazership](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/tazership-img.png?raw=true)

This ship, originally created to explot a vulnurability in a malfunctioning Korath ship, is fitted with a powerful electrical arc weapon which bypasses shields entirely and does massive amounts of damage.


![Impaler](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/dart-img.png?raw=true)

Inspired by the yaka arrow from guardians of the galaxy, this drone ship is capable of instantly destroying nearly every ship in the game. It also has a tracer effect similar to the one in the movies.


![Sol Invictus](https://github.com/IModThings/I_M_T-Endless-Sky-Mods/blob/master/Endless%20Addon/images/ship/Sol%20Invictus-img.png?raw=true)

Sol Invictus, a ship with a blue dwarf at it heart providing nearly unlimited energy along with thrust and a flame thrower like weapon.

[https://github.com/virmitio/ES_ExpandedTerritory](https://github.com/virmitio/ES_ExpandedTerritory) (last commit 2016-11-02) <br>

>This is a plugin for Endless Sky which adds a significant large area to fly around and explore. At this time there isn't much to see or do beyond just flying around the pair of newly accessable galaxies (which are not yet fully mapped out or populated).

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>## Intent:

Performing the below actions should result in a working directory `<work_dir>` which will permit the map editor and game to both correctly load the plugin while still keeping the plugin repository safely seperated from the root game data.

### Assumptions:
   - The repo was simply cloned to `%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory`
   - that steam is installed to the default location `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam`
   - that Endless Sky is installed to the default install location set by steam (`<steam_dir>\steamapps\common\...`)

### Commands:
```
cd <work_dir>
mklink /J data "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory\data"
mklink /J images "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Sky\images"
mklink /J repo "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory"

cd "%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Steam\steamapps\common\Endless Sky\images"
mklink es_et "%appdata%\endless-sky\plugins\ES_ExpandedTerritory\images\es_et"
```

When opening in the map editor, please open files by way of the `<work_dir>\data` directory tree.

# Audio conversion

Endless Sky is extremely specific about how it supports audio.  Currently, only
WAV for sound effects and MP3 for music is supported.

### Encoding sound effects

Sound effects are in WAV format.  Specifically, little-endian 16-bit PCM at
44100 Hz.

Here's an `ffmpeg` command to get sounds into an appropriate format.

    ffmpeg -i original.wav -ac 1 -f wav -c pcm_s16le -ab 705k -ar 44100 sounds/effect.wav

### Encoding music

MP3 specifically requires stereo format (2-channel) bit rate 179kb/s at 44100
Hz.

    ffmpeg -i original.wav -f mp3 -ar 44100 -ab 179k -ac 2 sounds/music.mp3
