>This plugin adds shipping containers and container ships to the game.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Endless Cargo

## What is it?

It's a plugin/mod for [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io) which attempts to add shipping containers and container ships to the game.

## How do I install it?

[Download the ZIP file](https://bitbucket.org/YellowApple/endless-cargo/downloads/) and extract it into your plugins folder.  Alternately, you can just `git clone` directly into the plugins folder (e.g. `git clone https://bitbucket.org/YellowApple/endless-cargo.git ~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/endless-cargo`).

## How does it work?

The current plan is to implement a shipping container as a sort of unarmed, ~~unpropelled~~ (HAHA, turns out at least *some* propulsion is needed for them to redock if you release them) drone, and in turn to implement a container ship as a sort of drone carrier.  This means that drones and shipping containers are interchangeable.

At this time, one type of container (a generic "Cargo Container") and two container ships (the Star Barge and Freighter without the welded-in containers and with drone bays for one's own containers) are implemented.  There's also a test mission out of Greenrock to haul an empty container to a nearby factory world (like New Britain or Luna), which I plan to flesh out and turn into more missions for more planets (including with specialized container types).  Most (if not all) factory worlds in human space sell containers, and the Container Barge and Container Freighter are available from any "Syndicate Basics" shipyard (and the former from any "Basic Ships" shipyard, so you can grab a Container Barge as your first ship right out of New Boston).

In the distant future, I might opt to attempt to implement containers as their own ship class, or perhaps as something that's not necessarily a "ship" per se.  This would require submitting this as a part of the vanilla game, though; while I think this idea is pretty cool, I'm also fully aware that's it's a *very* niche mod that probably doesn't belong in the core game, in which case - unless the core game opens up the ability to easily define new ship classes - the drone-container approach is probably the best I can do for the time being.

## What kinds of shipping containers will be implemented?

The average container (that is, the kind you'd actually want to buy at a shipyard) would have very little besides a few tons of cargo space and perhaps a smidge of outfit space.  A container ship would in turn have very little cargo or passenger space on its own, but could instead fill itself with shipping containers.

Once the basic shipping mechanics are implemented (namely, a basic container and a basic container ship), I'll likely delve into some missions involving specialized container types.  Some examples:

- Transport 5 containers carrying helicopters to Vail
- Haul 35 families and their prefabricated homes to a trailer park on New Boston
- Deliver 25 mining excavators and 5 portable field offices to a mining operation on Bounty
- etc.

Whether or not these specialized containers are something which you could buy in a shipyard is TBD.  There'd probably be no point to it, though I'm not one to stop someone from wasting money (especially if it's for roleplaying purposes or perhaps to resell somewhere else).

## Ain't this the same thing the Boxwing already does?

Kinda.  Containers are basically the drone version of the Boxwing.  Notable differences:

* Containers are drones, and thus don't require crew
* Containers are drones, and thus take up drone slots instead of fighter slots
* Containers are meant to make Boxwings look like Flivvers in comparison
* Containers have a fraction of the Boxwing's cargo space (currently 25%; I might bump that to 50% once I'm ready to actually dive into balancing)

Additionally, this plugin will feature actual missions/jobs/etc. revolving around container delivery, so it's certainly not limited to just adding a bunch of ships.

## Any gotchas?

* Containers deploy alongside the rest of your fighters and drones, so keep that in mind when you're in the heat of battle.
* Containers added by a container-hauling mission launch separately from your container ship, even if your own fighters/drones/containers are already docked.  This applies to all launches (haven't tested with wormholes yet).  Be sure to wait for your mission-added containers to redock between takeoff and jumping.
* Container-hauling missions currently don't have any multiplier for the number of containers or the distance involved.  [A bug/enhancement report has already been filed to hopefully rectify this.](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/issues/2569)

## What's the license?

GPLv3, with some CC-BY-SA-4.0 artistic assets.

<blockquote>### expert.crew.members
<br>
<br>
Adds unique crew members, aquireable through spaceport missions. These crew members are technically outfits which require a bunk and a salary, but no outfit space or mass. They add, depending on their technology field, stats to your ship. Like shield regeneration, more thrust, more cargo etc.<br>
<br>
Currently there are 90 expert crew members. Visit spaceports with an outfitter to find the missions(1% chance). In every of the following regions  you can find 5 experts: Rim, South, Dirt Belt, Deep, Near Earth, Core, North, Paradise, Hai, Bunrodea(after first contact), Remnant, Wanderer(after translation device), Kor Efret(after Rek went to the Kor Efret), Gegno, Successor, Arachi, Kimek, Saryd(last 3 after coalition first contact).<br>
Their technology fields are: combat(9) cooling(9) energy(9) engine(9) fuel(9) hull(9) jamming(9) scanner(9) shield(9) storage(9).<br>
In case you can't afford their daily wage you can store them at the outfitter without daily costs.<br>
They have the positive stats of a small human outfit, at the cost of a bunk and a daily salary of 2.000 to 5.000 credits. On a small ship they make a huge difference, while on a heavy warship the stats are minor.<br>
If you collect them all, you'll get a special mission.<br>
See <a href='https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins/blob/main/myplugins/expert.crew.members/crew.list.txt'>crew.list.txt</a> of this plugin for locations, and stat infos.<br>

<blockquote># hand-to-hand outfits
This is a plug-in for Endless Sky that adds a number of additional hand-to-hand outfits.

Outfits Include: Flack Vest, Tactical Armor, Stun Grenades, Tear Gas, Bolt Action Rifle, Blaster Rifle, Assault Rifle, Sidearm, Small Armory and Large Armory.

**Flack Vest** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a navy flack vest it increases capture attack and defense. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Tactical Armor** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a full suit of tactical body armor including a helmet. It is more expensive than the simple flack vest and provides a higher capture attack and defense. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Stun Grenades** - This hand-to-hand outfit is less expensive and less effective than fragmentation grenades. Unlike Fragmentation Grenades which are only available on pirate worlds stun grenades are available at various outfitters in Republic, Syndicate and Free Worlds space.

**Tear Gas** - This hand-to-hand outfit is more expensive and more effective than fragmentation grenades. Tear gas is available at a few select outfitters.

**Bolt Action Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is the least expensive and least effective. It is sold around the dirt belt purchased mostly by farmers to kill wildlife.

**Blaster Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is less expensive and less effective than the laser rifle. It is produced exclusively by The Syndicate and available at Syndicate outfitters.

**Assault Rifle** - This hand-to-hand outfit is more expensive and more effective than the laser rifle. They are produced primarily for The Navy and are available at a few select outfitters. The current art work being used as concept is from Phil Morley's Plug-in Phils Flavours available in Shields Up.

**Sidearm** - This hand-to-hand outfit is the least expensive and least effective weapon. They are low cost and available almost everywhere. Having them is better than being unarmed.

**Small Armory** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a selection of readily available offensive and defensive weapons to the crew increasing attack and defense capabilities. The armory takes up mass on the ship. The current art work being used as concept is from Rafael Ramawadh Plug-in Shields Up.

**Large Armory** - This hand-to-hand outfit provides a selection of readily available offensive and defensive weapons to the crew increasing attack and defense capabilities. The armory takes up mass on the ship. The current art work being used as concept is from Rafael Ramawadh Plug-in Shields Up.

No new missions, licenses or events have been added all outfits are available at the start of the game.

<blockquote># Human-Space-Overhaul
 Alters Human-Tier Progression and unlocks

This is a progression overhaul focusing on human space, designed to vary human-tier outfits a bit more while also giving incentives to side with each human faction.

# Changelog

The South now has its own anti-missile turrets and sells all civilian shield generators (including two extra large shield generators for their carriers).
The Plasma turret and repeater are now available from the start of the game, however the repeater is locked behind the Militia license. Some free worlds unlocks have been adjusted accordingly.

The plasma repeater has been buffed slightly to make it a more alluring feature of siding with the militia.

The Syndicate now sells enhanced engines, better batteries, regenerators, a larger reactor, an upgraded proton turret and the ionic afterburner, most of which are locked behind a purchaseable license.

The Navy now has its own shield generators and active cooling outfits, both of which are substantially better than their competitors' offerings. Naturally, their outfits are locked behind their own license.

Many southern ships now use the new anti-missiles, and both Syndicate heavy warships use regenerators, their new engines, and their new batteries. Navy ships have been similarly reoutfitted to use their improved technology.

>After the Korath have salvaged the Kor Automata building cores, not only did they begin to replicate automata ships, but they also integrated the best parts of both Kor Factions onto their Korath Raider.

>(This takes place after the Co-Op Wanderer/Korath mission and adds a Korath Pillager variant to their raiding fleets.) ("korath raid")

>So you might no longer be able to equip captured Kor Automata with jump drives but at least you will be able to get something even better. Has a large amount of crew required to balance its awesomeness

>Basically merges the Good of both Mereti and Sestor Ships into one

<blockquote># Endless Sky Korath Automation Upgrade
A plugin for [Endless Sky][endless-sky] which adds a new Korath Warship after the end of the Korath/Wanderer Co-Op Mission

![image][image]

Easier to capture than a Worldship, this 2.3 Tier Ship is obtainable after aiding the Wanderer/Korath in disabling the Kor Automata.
It does not replace the Korath Raider but rather complements it. If you do the Remnant Storyline after the Wanderer one, you will have an extra challenge with a few of these monstrosities. This Mod adds some challenge after beating the Automata out of Kor Efreti space

>An offshoot of my Amalgamation plugin from 4 years ago, I wanted to bring some of the old QOL outfits from that collection of plugins back into the modern Endless Sky landscape. Hope you enjoy.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># QOL Outfits
Hi I am the original author of the Amalgamation plugin, while I have gotten back into Endless Sky recently my ideas of polish have changed greatly over these 4 years.

I decided that while I wasn't satisfied with Amalgamation as a whole, many of the outfits from plugins like Shields up were still interesting to me, and something I wanted in the game all these years later.

So rather than uploading a massive plugin that turns away many people by its sheer size again, I would upload this, a small quality of life plugin that adds many of the smaller outfits I personally believe make building ships more fun overall.

I am also working on an independent plugin for the Shields Up 'Mil'taj' race, since that was where I put the most effort and had the most interest when making Amalgamation back in the day.

This Plugin adds a new armoury outfit that allows you to equip powerful boarding weaponry, while costing upkeep and space. A smaller outfit space expansion, external fuel pods, extended bunk rooms, a handful of basic human outfits to add a slight bit of variation and huge tier 5 radiant engines along with a small tier 0.

No other plugins are needed with this and implementation into the grander game is minimal outside of outfitters, since most of these are mostly for player use rather than to make AI ships more interesting.

Reccomended Plugins:

https://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate/tree/main (Mil'taj Protectorate) (My other plugin)

https://github.com/demolish238/Korath-Retribution (Korath Retribution) (My other plugin)

https://github.com/demolish238/Capitalis-Major (Capitalis Major) (My other plugin)

Used Plugins:

https://github.com/Amazinite/Shields-Up (Shields Up)

https://github.com/Amazinite/Enigma-Corp (Enigma Corps)

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Ship Modded

### How do I get this to work?

So you get my plugin by multiple ways...

1. Using `git clone https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded.git` (Recommended so you can use `git pull` to "update")

2. Going to [Git Repo](https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded) and selecting to download it as .zip or .tar.gz or some other compressed file (Not Recommended as it doesn't update easily)

From there locate your Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Linux: `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

Windows: `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\` (Replace yourusername with your PC's username)

Unpack/Unzip/Unrar or move the directory/folder into the Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Then restart Endless Sky if it's already running...

Enjoy!

### What is it?

This is a plugin/mod designed to provide special items that "cheat" or "hack" in the game, it allows you to modify just about everything on your ship all within game instead of needing to modify your save file.

My Primary Goal was so game developers/testers can travel through the game with ease.

My Secondary Goal was to make it so it's "Semi-Balanced" this way someone can still enjoy the original game without needing/depending on my mod/plugin.

My Third Goal was to make it so it's compatible with other plugins/mods that may be installed along side Ship Modded. (Such as All Content)

### License Info

This content uses GPL-3+ Licensing. (Yes we use quite a few of Endless Sky's Images and yes we want to give credit to them, thank you)

### What is added?

Added Outfits:

* AI Crew Replacement
* Anti-Scan Buffer
* Radar Jam Buffer
* Bunks Buffer
* Cargo Buffer
* Outfit Buffer
* Mass Debuffer
* Drag Debuffer
* Engine Buffer

<blockquote>### snowfeather.robotics <br>
<br>
<br>
Adds three missions that lead to adding androids to the outfitter on Snowfeather(Hai space). <br>
Starts on Snowfeather(Bore Fah) when having at least one android installed. <br>
<br>
To get an android, which is needed to start this plugin, do the remnant mission 'shattered light 4'. Alternatively my plugin 'more.boarding.missions' gives androids as rare reward for boarding pirates.<br>
The new buyable worker androids are twice as expensive as the original ones, and pay off after like 4 years. Also 6 fighting androids are added, technically they are h2h outfits (with attack/defense 2/2, 4/4, 6/6, 8/8, 10/10, 12/12). To keep all androids close a new outfit category "Androids" was made.<br>

Removes mass and outfit space from some uniques, puts others into unique category, or gives a png if there isn't one. Also adds lots of new uniques.<br>

>Expands outfit variety across all castes of vanilla Endless Sky.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># Zoura's Outfits Expanded

This plugin aims to greatly expand outfit variety across all of Endless Sky; at the moment, every subfaction (except for the Quarg, T3 Pug, and Drak) has received at least one outfit, though most have received more than that.
Also of note is that care has been made to ensure that outfits are all accessible by at least one means through normal, otherwise-vanilla gameplay (for example, Korath and Gegno outfits can be obtained by looting/capping, Human and Hai outfits via outfitters, et cetera).
The mod also features support for Darcy Manoel's Omnis as well, for those who'd like to cheat- I mean, play around with the outfits in an easily accessible environment.

The primary goal of this plugin is to increase the variety in vanilla's weapon and outfit selection while preserving a "vanilla-ish" level of balance, allowing players to mix plugin and vanilla content to where all-vanilla builds are still viable, but plugin outfits offer unique advantages for certain build types or simply new ways to interact with ship statistics (for example, there are several outfits that allow you to augment the strength of your shields and hull, but with noticeable downsides).

The above said, if something seems a bit too over/underpowered, please don't hesitate to give me a shout, either here on the github (through an issue or a PR of your own) or on discord @zoura3025 (I can also be found on the Endless Sky discord).
This plugin is also accepting community contributions! If you have an outfit you'd like to see implemented in this plugin's (lack of) style, please don't be afraid to drop an issue or PR.
