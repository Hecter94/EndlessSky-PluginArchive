### -Omnis

Author: TheGiraffe3 | Category: Cheats <br>
[https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/-Omnis](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/-Omnis) (last commit 2025-08-01) <br>

>The most extensive all-content plugin to date. It includes many opportunities to test balance or ship builds against AI driven ships or fleets, all vanilla content and the content of many plugins available to use to put together different ship builds. Many more tools are included into Omnis too!

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### Welcome to Omnis!
Omnis has risen to be the #1 all-content plugin in the community, though competition is still encouraged as only from different perspectives can the best iteration of this niche be reached. Omnis was released after [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge) but before [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo), and good faith was practiced by all competing authors.

In order of release, known competitors have been:
- [All Content Plugin](https://github.com/endless-sky/all-content-plugin)
- [World Forge](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/world-forge)
- [Ciu Kreo](https://github.com/RestingImmortal/Ciu-Kreo)
- [Ruin the Fun](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun)

### What to expect
There is no need to worry about breaking existing saves when installing, you will be presented with a warning that lets you choose what level of involvement you want that save to have with Omnis. To avoid any interaction, there's an option to abort which will kill the player and disallow saving the interaction.

So how do you use this plugin? Well there are two very simple methods of [accessing Omnis](https://github.com/EndlessSkyCommunity/-Omnis/wiki/Access). 
There is a wormhole in each of the major factions' systems to travel there, and there is a custom start that can be chosen when making a new pilot.

> [!WARNING]
> The Omnis custom start will begin your pilot with an impossibly high credit value and brand your save with the Omnis start.

<blockquote># All-Content Plugin
This plugin was made to allow content creators to have access to all outfits in a single place, for the purpose of designing and testing outfit loadouts for new ships. Of course, it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it.

# Contributing
This plugin is meant to mirror the most recent official release of [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), rather than its most recent "continuous build," and as such should be usuable to those who use Steam or PPAs as the source of their game version. As such, PRs are welcome following new additions during an ES release cycle, but depending on the scope of the contribution, may not be merged promptly.

<blockquote>### automata.destruction.0percent
<br>
<br>
Modifies the self destruction chance of Sestor and Mereti ships to a value of 0.0 (0%).<br>
<br>
Sestor 349/109/78/71/53/27/14 and Mereti 512/256/128/64/32/16/8 ships have a self destruction value of 0.0 (0%) now.<br>
You can easily change the values in automata.txt for each ship ('"self destruct" .0') to a value of your choice. I.e. 0.12 is 23%, 0.3 is 51%, 0.5 is 75%. Its calculated twice, first the chance for self destruction on boarding(i.e. 0.3) is 30%, then of the remaining 70% again 30% chance for self destruction on capturing. That makes 30% + 21% = 51% overall chance for self destruction on a capturing try.<br>

Author: zuckung | Category: Cheats <br>
[https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins](https://github.com/zuckung/endless-sky-plugins) (last commit 2025-06-19) <br>

>Makes person ships capturable. See the readme for details.
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>### capturable.person.ships
<br>
<br>
Makes person ships captureable.<br> 
<br>
<br>
Well, technically this plugin disables the person ships, and creates new ones which are captureable (with changed names to "<name> (C)", due to limitations of changing parts of the originals). Also adds all of them to the author government, adjusts some personalities and sets all frequencies to 1000. Changed "Tranquility" to have a weapon, so it doesn't flee. And changed "Zitchas" personality to "decloaked", so it doesn't flee and regenerate while cloaked.<br>
Attacking one of them makes all your enemies, they all try to disable instead of destroying, and they all have the same spawn chance which is in average 10 minutes.<br>
<br>
At Earth's job board you can find a repeatable job that displays which persons you have already killed, which are alive, and where to find them. If the plugin control.station is installed hou can find the list there, along with this readme.<br>
After you've killed them all, you receive a small unique gift.<br>
<br>
I tested this plugin with 10x KIV349, all equipped with Mereti beam weapons, was probably an overkill on most. Boarding "Zitchas"(1000 crew) needed an Echo-Galleon, and I tried it with hand2hand outfits plugin. Maybe it works with nerve gas too.<br>
In cap_persons.txt you find the following line under gamerules: "#	"person spawn period" 2000". If you remove the "#" the spawning speed is increased to one spawn in around half a minute.<br>

Makes gameplay for Endless-Sky more casual
- Ships are heavier making navigation and combat slower
- Higher range for some cannons to compensate ship speed
- Less, slower and weaker asteroids to increase clarity, FPS and easier mining
- Bigger sprites for bigger ships

## WIP:

## Limits:
- No game balancing has been done after the ship and weapon modifications

Adds all existing coalition outfitters and shipyards to 'Far Home'. Also adds a new shipyard and a new outfitter with missing ships/outfits.<br>
To start the mission to enable these outfitters and shipyards, you have to join Heliarch or Lunarium (complete the first chapter of these storylines) and own/pay 6/5 million credits. The mission starts anywhere in coalition space. I added this plausible mission to make the plugin feel less cheaty.<br>

### Kestrel Rework

>Make Kestrel a much better ship, and increased requirements.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>Kestrel Rework Readme:
This is a small rework of the Kestrel ship. The intent is to put it on par with several higher tiered alien outfits, most notablely Wanderer (2) outfits, as opposed to standard Human (1-1.5) Outfits. 
This does not make much sense according to the lore, but I personally prefer the asthetic of the Kestrel compared to many of the Wanderer ships. as such, the changes are as follows:

-The requirements for the Kestrel sub-quest have been changed:
	-The combat rating was increased from 8,000 (Combat rank 9: "Force to be reckoned with") --> 22,000 (Combat rank "Fearsome Scrapper). Intended to limit obtaining the newly buffed ship until the player is on a similar power level.
	-Increased the standard cost of the ship from 14700000 --> 67500000, as another change intended to limit how early a player could obtain the ship.
	-Buffed "Unknown ship type" by roughly half of the changes to the base Kestrel (I.E, instead of 49,700 shields, the test ship will have about 23,000), increasing the difficulty of the inital test fight while not requiring too much power to win.

-Base model "Kestrel" (Unlisted stats were not changed)
	-Shields 19,400 --> 49,700
	-Hull 7,200 --> 30,400
	-Fuel Capacity 500 --> 700
	-Outfit space 810 --> 900
	-Weapon capacity 390 --> 410
	-Engine Capacity 210 --> 230
	-Bunks 128 --> 150

-Engine Kestrel:
	-Drag -1.0 --> -2.0
	-Fuel Capacity 100 --> 300
	
-Shield Kestrel:
	-Shields 3,000 --> 28,000
	-Hull 1,500 --> 4,900

-Weapon Kestrel:
	-Weapon Capacity 40 --> 150

<blockquote>Ruin The Fun (es-ruin-the-fun)
===

Cheat plugin for [endless-sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky), to ruin your fun, or to assist you in making or testing another plugin.

Access all ships and outfits, change your captain's name, choose the color swizzle of your ships, edit your relation with other governments, set your combat rank, hire a powerful escort, gift yourself pre-outfitted ships, give yourself money, and much more.



## Downloads

- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: Sources](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/archive/refs/heads/main.zip):
  This is the latest commit to the plugin. It may or may not be stable, and it may also not work at all or break your save.
- [🎁 Ruin-The-Fun: Tested Release](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/latest) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/latest/download/-es-ruin-the-fun.zip):
  This is a tested and recommended version. But perhaps not the latest.
  Has better plugin support than other releases.
- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: (Automatic Updates)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/):
  This version is automatically generated on every new game version (either pre-release or release).
  It should feature the latest game content.
  However, if the data file syntax was changed by the new version, this might cause warnings or errors.
- [📦 Ruin-The-Fun: (Endless Sky continuous)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/tag/es-continuous) [(direct download)](https://github.com/Pshy0/es-ruin-the-fun/releases/download/es-continuous/-es-ruin-the-fun-for-es-continuous.zip):
  This version is periodically generated to match continuous builds of Endless Sky. This is also the latest untested RTF version.
  If you do not use continuous Endless Sky builds, do not use this version, as it will contain things that are not yet in you game (that will be a problem).



## Install

Install this plugin by dropping it into the game's `plugins` folder.
If the plugin is in a `.zip` / archive file, extract it.

The game's `plugins` folder should be located at one of those locations:
- On Windows:
  - `plugins\ (in the same folder as the Endless Sky executable)`
  - or `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\`
- On Linux:
  - `/usr/share/games/endless-sky/plugins/`
  - or `/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`
- On Mac:
  - `Contents/Resources/plugins/ (within the application bundle)`
  - or `/Library/Application Support/endless-sky/plugins`

If the `plugins` folder does not exist, you can create it.

If you did it right, there should be a file `plugins/-es-ruin-the-fun/about.txt` or `plugins/-Ruin The Fun/about.txt`.

> This plugin should not conflict with any other, because it uses separate systems and prefixes objects it defines.



## Startup

⚠️ **Be advised against using this plugin with your favorite pilot's save**, since it will make your hours of labor nonsensical.
If you want to use this plugin for an existing save anyway, then **MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR PILOT** (for instance with the `Add snapshot` button).

![add snapshot button](./images/screenshot/add-snapshot.png)

If your intent is rather to use this plugin with a new pilot, you may use one of the starts provided by this plugin to do so:

![new pilot starts menu](./images/screenshot/rtf-starts.png)
You will spawn in an RTF system, from which cheat features are available.

Cheat features are available from, and only from, the RTF systems. One of them has an hyperlink to `Rutilicus` (the default start system), so that you can reach it with an Hyperdrive:

![map screenshot](./images/screenshot/rtf0-on-map.png)

There is other RTF systems everywhere on the map, so you do not have to cross it whole.

![map screenshot](./images/screenshot/rtf-systems-on-map.png)



## Spaceport

![Spaceport](./images/screenshot/spaceport-button.png)

Click the `Spaceport` button to access a number of quick actions.
More actions are available from the `Job Board`.



## Job Board

![Job Board](./images/screenshot/job-board-button.png)

The `Job Board` contains most of this plugin's features.

The following jobs can be used after every landing on an RTF planet:
- `[basic] All Useful Things`: Get money, reveal the map, and earn combat rank 14.
- `[basic] Color Swizzle`: Change the color of your ships.
- `[basic] Combat Rank`: Set your combat rank. Optionally spawn a target in space, to get xp from.
- `[basic] Conditions`: Set your karma and other conditions.
- `[basic] Events`: Let you edit a few vanilla conditions.
- `[basic] Free Money`: Obtain 1B credits.
- `[basic] Government Reputations`: Change your reputation with other governments.
- `[basic] Pilot Name`: Change your captain's name.
- `[basic] Reveal Map`: Reveal the whole system map (upon take of).
- `[basic] Reveal Planet Infos`: Reveal all vanilla planets information (upon take of, does not reveal systems).
- `[escort] * Barges` (3 variants): Get escorted by dreadful Star Barges.
- `[escort] Escort Fleets`: Select fleets to spawn as NPC escorts.
- `[escort] Escort Ships`: Select ships to spawn as NPC escorts.
- `[escort] Tek Far 109`: Get escorted by a customized drone transporter.
- `[fight] Combat Drones`: Summon an amount of hostile Combat Drones.
- `[fight] Fight Fleet`: Pick hostile fleets to spawn.
- `[fight] Fight Ships`: Pick hostile ships to spawn.
- `[fight] Kestrels`: Summon a combination of hostile Kestrels.
- `[fight] Tek Far 109`: Summon an hostile customized drone transporter.
- `[special] RTF Advanced Start`: Replays the advanced start conversation.

The following jobs are toggles, their effect is reverted when you abort them:
- `[toggle fleet] Heliarchs vs Quargs`: Adds Heliarch and Quarg fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle fleet] Meretis vs Sestors`: Adds Mereti and Sestor fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle fleet] Scin vs Vis`: Adds Scin and Vi fleets to RTF0.
- `[toggle] Automatic Galaxy Map`: Automatically reveal all connected systems upon entering one.
- `[toggle] Hide RTF Systems`: Hide the RTF systems, so that they do not interfere.
- `[toggle] Super Reach`: While in an RTF system, you can jump to any system on the map, even without a God Drive. By default, RTF systems have a lower jump range, to lower their impact on surrounding content.
- `[toggle] Variants`: Enable ship variants in the RTF shipyards.



## Shipyard

![Shipyard](./images/screenshot/shipyard-button.png)

From the RFT shipyards, all ships in the game are available to you.



## Outfitter

![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/outfitter-button.png)

From the RTF outfitters, all outfits in the game are available to you.

RTF also adds a few outfits, all listed under the `RTF God Outfits` category:
- `God Drive`: Jump drive, with no range limit, that does not consume fuel.
- `God Mode`: Makes you immortal.
- `God Turret`: Turret that one-shot any ships.
- `God Disabling Turret`: Disables ships without destroying them.
- `100000 Outfit Space`: Gives you more than enough outfit space.
- `100000 Cargo Space`: Gives you so much cargo space that this will trigger pirate raids.

You can also find outfits that only change a single stat in the `Individual Stats` category. They look like this:
![Outfitter](./images/screenshot/wheel-examples.png)



## Updating Content

You can **update the plugin's vanilla content** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make update

You may have to set the path to the Endless Sky `data` folder as instructed.

You can **include content from other plugins** by running the following command inside the plugin's directory:
> make plugin-update

This will only work if all plugins, including RTF, are in the same `plugins` folder.



## Assets (placeholders)

You can use those assets as placeholders:
 - [Outfits](./images/outfit/rtf/)
 - [Sounds](./sounds/)

Info about individual assets are available from [./copyright](./copyright).



## Moving an RTF system

You can use a mission and an event like this to move a RTF system to your plugin's galaxy:
```
mission "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
    landing
    on offer
        event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
        fail
event "MYPLUGIN Move RTF10"
	system "RTF10"
		pos -2700 -1500
```

>World Forge does this as well, but extends this: not only all outfits in one place, but sorted by race additionally, a way to change the swizzle(derived from ProjectRunabout), a easy way to add own outfits and ships into the existing scheme, and  missions to change your reputation with factions!

<blockquote># World-Forge Plugin for [Endless-Sky](https://endless-sky.github.io/)
World-Forge is a plugin for content creators and developers of endless-sky, adding a few systems, which have all outfits and ships available to buy. 

Have a look at [the wiki](https://github.com/Wrzlprnft/world-forge/wiki) for more information and to see what this plugin is capable of.

It is not yet finished, but working.
It does support older pilots without doing harm to them, but also has a altered start for new pilots.

## I do not recommend this for playing in super sandbox mode, because the game might actually get boring using all the superweapons, but if you're into that, go ahead.

Thx Local God, LeafyGrove, Storm Crow for helping in creating and updating.
Thx to Earl Grey, from whom i basically copied and edited the swizzle change system.
Special Thanks goes to Derpy Horse, as well as the official title "Maintainer of World Forge". 
No, for real, Derpy is the reason this still exists.

<blockquote># ZESglobal
Zitchas's Endless Sky Global mod. This is a collection of files intended to change the general feel of the game. These files and changes are intended to be complimentary and used together, but you are welcome to pick and choose which changes you want.

ZOutfitSpace
The first mod in this set is ZOutfitSpace. This file expands the outfit space of all ships by 5%. Ships for whom 5% would be less than 5 extra space instead are straight up given 5 extra space. One of the central aspects of Endless Sky is outfitting, and while the challenge of making effective and useful ships in limited space is fun; On the flip side, I dislike having to *always* be focused on min-maxing the combat capabilities of my ship. I *enjoy* putting "non-combat" outfits on my ships; things like research laboratories, or salvage scanners. Even if I get almost no combat advantage from it, I enjoy being able to see the tactical scanner info on my GUI. 
This file does not change the Bactrian, Puffin, or Indigenous ships.
