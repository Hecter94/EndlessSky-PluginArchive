<blockquote># Amphibious-Ships

 This is a plugin for Endless Sky adding a T3-ish race whose ships and weapons are inspired by modern day naval ships. The ships added range from pesky missile boats all the way to super battleships and heavy carriers, with powerful fighters to compliment them.
Currently the plugin features:
- 35 new systems
- 27 new ships: 12 Warships, 4 Dedicated Carriers, 6 Logistical Ships (1 of which has a special variant), 2 Outriggers (with 5 uniquely sprited and statted variants each), 2 Fighters, and 1 Drone.
- 20 new weapons
- A new engine set (6 thrusters, 6 steerings)
- 27 unique outfits
- A powerful new foe in the form of Quarg Automata

<blockquote># Bailiff-plugin
My first plugin for the open source space exploration game, Endless Sky.

The intention is to provide an alternative means for a player to earn money and a way of punishing players who get too much into debt.

This first release has a very quick and dirty ship to be used as a Bailiff ship.  

Further changes to be implemented...

Some way of getting the Bailiff licence (I'll be testing the Bailiff ship first to refit with human outfits first)

Some way of getting Bailiff to chase impoverished players.

Right now it's mostly bare-bones versions so you don't have to pay for a bunch of outfits you're just going to sell - instead you get a (very) cheap engine & power system, a hyperdrive (or scram drive for the really big ships), & luxury accommodations when they're part of the stock loadout.

<blockquote>A plugin which adds variants of human ships to select shipyards. No stat changes, just loadouts. Right now it's mostly bare-bones versions so you don't have to pay for a bunch of outfits you're just going to sell - instead you get a (very) cheap engine & power system, a hyperdrive, & signature equipment like luxury accommodations for Star Liners.

Also adds a shipyard to Trinket which sells bare-bones Furies, Sparrows, & Modified Argosies.

I'll make a full list of outfit loadouts up if there's enough interest. This is my first plugin, so I wasn't documenting as I went.

<blockquote># Capitalis Major
A collection of four superheavy ships, each with their own missions to unlock them, all of which are only available after the main story has been finished.

For those who want the Sestor capital ship, don't worry if you can't capture it the first time you find it, as long as it isn't destroyed it will be available to fight in a different location later on where you can challenge it when you are prepared.
Only one Sestor capital is available unlike the other ships in this plugin.

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>Semi-dead, though the dream is still alive! Expect very slow progress with occasional small additions.

Current to-do (loosely sorted by which are likely first):
- 1: Rework all existing ships to something that actually looks decent; see new Guardian and Warrior models.
- 2: Replace more placeholder outfits with my own (stealing effects and sounds for placeholder though).
- 3: Improve the map more (add more commodities, planets, descriptions etc. to make it feel more alive).
- 4: Add some basic jobs to give stuff to do.
- 5: More ships!
- 6: Some basic intro missions to give some lore to the player about what this strange alien civilisation is about.

Note: Some reasonably-solid lore points already exist, though with some story missions and descriptions more details will be made and revealed.

<blockquote># Kaynz

Kaynz is a plugin for [Endless Sky](http://endless-sky.github.io) which plans to add an entire story arc to the original game.

### Story arc description

The goal is to add an ulterior story arc to the main game, which puts it, as of the moment this is redacted, after the wanderer storyline.
The plugin will add a new galaxy to the game, with a new race: the Kaynz. They are intended to be a tier 4 alien race, capable of taking down Drak ships (with some difficulty however), a detail important to the lore.
The Kayn people are intended to be human-like, however slender, smaller, and with a pronounced blue skin. 
They will come in three main factions :
* The Kayn Empire: The original faction of the Kaynz, a stagnant empire in almost every way, yet still powerful
* The Kayn Republic: The first of the two factions separated from the Empire. They still maintain relationship with the Empire, but there clearly is tension between those two factions. They are ruled by an elected Senate, or they pretend it to be that way, and is thriving economicaly.
* The New Kaynz form the last main faction, which also seceded from the Empire. They are at war with both the Empire and the Republic, however there is not much fighting going on. They are ruled by a closed council, and are thriving on a military and a technological standpoint.
The storyline will involve a first contact between humans and kaynz, the future of their relationship and the conclusion of the Kayn internal conflict

### Current status

(what is done so far)
* essential specific outfits (engines, first weapons, power, shield, heat dissipation)
* first Kayn Republic ships (Honorbound and Dragonfly)
* some cargo ships (for merchants mainly)
* first contact questline (ongoing)
* most of the galaxy (including planets)
* lore introduction

### TODO list

Gameplaywise:
* more ships specific to the Kayn Republic (currently Honorbound and Dragonfly)
* ships specific to the New Kaynz
* ships specific to the Kayn Republic
* more civilian ships
* outfit balancing
* more specific outfits
* more jobs
* finalizing galaxy (New Kayn space to do particulary)
* wormhole stabilisation station sprites
* SPRITES! (Honorbound sprite is the only "not ugly" one so far)

Writingwise:
* entire New Kayn storyline (including siding with them (long term))
* entire Kayn Empire storyline (including siding with them (long term))
* continuation of the Kayn Republic storyline
* add more lore 
* fix the author's mandatory english mistakes

[https://github.com/Zitchas/ES_Lampyrid_Start](https://github.com/Zitchas/ES_Lampyrid_Start) (last commit 2024-04-02) <br>

>Alternate start with Lampyrid ship.
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># ES_Lampyrid_Start
Have you ever wanted to start Endless Sky flying something a bit more unique than the typical shuttle, starbarge, or sparrow? Have you dreamed of having a pilot that starts their career with an old ship they've been fixing up for the past few years? Well, Lampyrid Start does that. 

Choosing this starts has your pilot start their career flying a slightly modified version of the Lampyrid, which is a decent balanced transport/freighter with the capacity to be fairly fast compared to others of its class.

Be warned, however, that all is not peace, prosperity, and clear skies: Despite the tweak adding an anti-missile turret to the Lampyrid, it has sufficient cargo capacity to attract pirates on a semi-regular basis. Possibly even on your first launch. So you will have to be alert, and probably need to see about either upgrading your ship to be faster; or replacing the AM with a more intimidating turret.

So long as you can avoid the pirates, this will be an easier and faster start than the standard ones. The pirate risk can make it a little riskier and slightly more challenging, though. Just think of them as Reavers, and it'll be just like flying in the Firefly universe.

This plugin adds four starts:
- Normal start, which is identical to the usual new pilot experience except starting with a "Lampyrid Mk. III" ship.
- 3011 start, which is identical to the normal start, except you start one year early. This means you have a year to get used to the galaxy before the war starts.
- 3010 start, which is identical to the normal start, except you start two years early.
- 3011 no-loan start. This start has you begin a year early compared to the default ES new game, and instead of starting with a loan, you just have 10k credits and your "Lampyrid Mk. III" spaceship.
- The Deep start. This is intended to be on par with the default start, just that you start in the Deep instead of the Dirt Belt.
- The Paradise start. This is an easier start, without the pressure of a mortgage to pay off and startinng in a safer area.
- The South start. This is a harder start in a more dangerous area.

<blockquote># Mega Freight
 Content plugin for opensource game [Endless Sky](https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky)

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19187937/176770486-96d0ba66-0464-4557-ab3b-ef5c43d44505.PNG)

Adds several ships for you and various factions to use adding more variety to the galaxy as well as universe progression releasing new ships and technologies dependent and independent of storyline (mostly just human space for now).
* Faction with new ships: Merchant, Pirate, Republic, Syndicate, Free Worlds, Hai, Wanderer

Summary of what this plugin adds:

Over 150 ships:
* 50+ Freighters including specialized cargo ships (Fuel, LNG, Chemical, etc.) + 2 Superheavy
* 4 Transports
* 3 Space Liner
* 10+ Utility (Carriers, miners, etc.)
* 20+ Warships + 2 Superheavy (Purpose-built and modification of existing.)
* 1 Battlestation
* 10+ Fighters, Drones, and other carried ships (Utility and Combat)
* 1 Interceptor
* Majority of the ships with limited turret arc both for aesthetic and gameplay.

And other things:
* A few weapons and outfits. 
* Special jobs that gets expanded with appropriate ship (Mining, Gas shipping, Chemical shipping, Heavy lift/Crane, Cars, Salvaging, etc.)
* Additional luxury jobs/rich passengers depending on outfits.
* Huge jobs (Passengers, Deliveries, Escorts).
* Just a lot more jobs which are often location-specific. Planet that mines radioactive things export more of that. Leading electronics manufacturer export more of advanced electronics. etc. (WIP)
* New sub-factions often with unique variants, weapons, or even ships (Espion Mining, Rangphenn, Ugyr, Jack's, Rakin, Black Death, Crossguard, Sulso, Maryhal, NGK, Core Food, Core Nuclear, Solacer, Luna Winery, GX, NBSL, KDB/Reshetka, Bellwing/Stilletto).
* NPC fleets using the new ships.
* Cargo fleets along major trade routes.
* Persistent NPC (Battlestations in 3 systems, 2 of which can respawn after some time.)
* Additional ship spawn for some story missions.
* Orbital shipyard orbiting Mars after main plot.
* A few stations (Nordlin, Ankulah, Yokosuka, GS1 Galaxy, Ourea, Forge, Ankaim, Titanite, Zagreus)
* Gradual progression of the universe both dependent and independent of story missions. 
  * Stronger pirate fleet over time and merchants upgrading their weapons to keep up. 
  * New ships and technologies (timed and/or locked behind story missions and locked behind jobs)
  * Factions constructing new stations.
  * Limited time events that will be resolved by governments after a while.
  * Unlocking secret/exclusive shipyards by gaining favour with specific sub-factions.
* Additional shipyard and outfitter to various locations.
* Basically overhaul human space at this point.

Requires Unstable Build/0.10.7 or above.

# Recommended 

To fully utilize mining/utility fighters and drones provided with this plugin you can try Sam's Mining Complete fork of the game which allows you ~~command your ships to target mineable asteroids~~(In vanilla now) and distribute fuel among your fleet with fighters. The fork also provides other gameplay improvements and bug fixes.

(Possibly outdated as of 19/07/2023)

<blockquote>A small collection of custom ships: primarily drones and multipurpose freighter/utility ships, most of which can carry varying amounts of drones. If the ES Defense Drone Plugin is also installed, non-miner merchants will be loaded with Defense Drones.

Alt. link: https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/blob/main/plugins.md#defense-drone-plugin



About the ships:

CARGO DRONE - 
An EV Nova classic that I always felt was missing from the game. Unarmed, cheap, and fast; they're designed to be able to keep up with (Heavy) Shuttles and be easy to keep buying more of in the early game as you can afford them to exponentially grow your profits on a small scale, but watch out for your piracy threat rating if you spam them. Later on, they can also be useful in conjunction with Mining Drones and the rest of the ships in this plugin to collect flotsam and such.

MUDROCK - 
A medium-heavy freighter/warship hybrid; intended to be comparable to the IDA Frigate from EV Nova, but kinda turned into its own thing. It's meant to look and feel like an older design, retaining a ramscoop, auxiliary solar power, and weak anti-missile defences. Modern refits can substantially improve the ship by using its extensive outfit space more efficiently. Size- and stat-wise it falls between the Hauler III and Behemoth, but with an unusually strong hull and an emphasis on outfits over cargo; it's also comparable to the Mule.

GEMSTONE - 
Basically an Aerie that carries 4 drones instead of 2 fighters. With 2 guns and 4 turret hardpoints, it's intended to be a versatile platform for carrying various utility items like Tractor Beams. Its large capacity relative to its mass makes it noticeably slower when fully loaded with both drones and cargo.

DEEPVALE - 
Big boy ship for some real industrial-scale asteroid sweeping. With 10 turrets and 8 drone bays, it can carry any utilities it might need and follow in the wake of its drones vacuuming up all the flotsam. Being designed with mining in mind, it is relatively fast for such a heavy ship, albeit not quite to the level of the Auxiliary and Bactrian.

PACKET LINER - 
Passenger/cargo hybrid ship. Stat-wise it's quite literally half a Star Queen with a Freighter bolted on. It can also be described as a bigger Blackbird, and like the Blackbird it makes for a decent warship.

THUNDERER - 
A high-speed ship good for a lot of things since it's basically a medium warship with the weapon and engine capacities swapped. The original design intent was to be a relatively large ship that can achieve the speed to mine fast-moving asteroid fields, but it also makes for a great pirating or smuggling ship.

CAVALIER - 
Heavy gunboat with a 5/2 gun/turret hardpoint layout and a low-drag armored hull. Middling engine capacity and poor heat dissipation make it a little clunky, but like the Raven it is undeniably capable of punching above its weight.

LANCIER - 
A torpedo boat, bigger than the Navy's Rainmaker, with a total of 10(!) gun ports and a defensive turret. Its weapons array is impressive-looking but the ship itself is slow and vulnerable, so in the present day it is mainly used for intimidating merchant convoys. That said, with war looming in 3014, it might find a new lease on life.

Some of these ships also have variants in the style of the vanilla Navy Auxiliary, with different models and base stats.

An Endless Sky plugin.

Includes the following ships:
Starbridge
Mod. Starbridge
Pirate Starbridge
Pirate Mod. Starbridge (not actually in the original EVN)
Rebel Starbridge
Railbridge (Mod Stabridge with wingtip blasters replaced by railguns) (Civilian/Pirate/Rebel/Forbidden variants)

Also, two types of infinite ammunition railguns have been added for the authentic EVN experience. The ships and weapons can be bought from various advanced shipyards and outfitters. As a fallback, all Starbridge variants and outfits featured in this mod are available at any Syndicate Advanced shipyard.

The Pirate Mod Starbridge was suggested by EjoThims on discord.

The Starbridge is a ship from the game Escape Velocity Nova, according to the EVN wiki:

The Civilian Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Modified Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Pirate Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.
The Rebellion Starbridge was modelled by Scott Vardy, torn back to individual polygons and put back together by Dave Williams for Lightwave, then remodelled by Dave with textures by either Philip Chick or Dave.

The end result should be something like [file-path]\endless-sky\plugins\[plugin-name], which in turn will contain that specific mod's data, images, and sounds folders, and possibly readme and copyright info.

>End-game flagship with *jazz hands* modularity! 

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote># The Peacebringer
Plugin for Endless Sky
WORK IN PROGRESS!!!

  "The Peacebringer is a one of a kind ship, commissioned not for sport, nor in exchange for money, or any other material offering that could conceivably produce any standard spacecraft into reality, but instead as a reparation to a remarkable individual who has woven together the failing strings of the galaxy with their bare hands; a gift to one who has saved humanity one or more times from an otherwise hopeless drive to extinction. It is tribute, to ensure that this individual, whomever they may be, can continue their extraordinary drive to keep the universe together.
  I guess you could also just... y'know, buy it from the Omnis shipyard, but that's kind of mean."
~ shipyard description

The Peacebringer is (going to be) a near end-game flagship "rewarded" to the player immediately after the (spoilers!) Kor Sestor missions involving their breach of human space. Well, when I say "rewarded", I mean that they're going to be sent across the galaxy on a wild goose chase for the most advanced technologies that each species has to offer in order to build, piece by piece, the most powerful starship that humanity has ever witnessed. A culmination of all creations advanced and arcane combined together into an unmatched set of speed, firepower, stealth, and modularity, the Peacebringer is kind of like a mini Heron but has a bunch of different alien technologies instead of just stuff from the Remnant.

To-do, generally:
- find appropriate, somewhat lore-friendly way to introduce
- model ship, and custom outfits (if any)
- outfit the ship
- create gathering missions
- snort ringworld shavings
