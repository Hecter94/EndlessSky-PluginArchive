<blockquote># Arc Over

![arcover-h](https://github.com/Saugia/arc-over/assets/93169396/ce10ff31-532b-43ce-930b-d6d5d3ea30e3)

This repository is for the Endless Sky plug-in "Arc Over". The plug-in currently encompasses all vanilla ships except person ships as well as ships not yet used in vanilla gameplay. As new ships are added to vanilla, this plug-in will be updated.

## About
Arc Over gives limited angles to turret mounts on vanilla ships, adding another balance aspect to combat gameplay. These arcs are determined by a few factors, and are given exceptions in some cases, some being more lenient than others, and others being no limits at all. For detailed information, see the `arc notes.txt` file in the data folder for general concept and specific choices for each faction.

## Download
For a "stable release", check out the Releases on the righthand side of this page and download the Source.zip file and extract to your plug-ins directory, so that there's the "arc-over-version#" folder in your plug-ins folder.
For getting the "continuous", which can be changed at any moment, click on the green `<> Code` button at the top right of the repository and download the ZIP file, then extract it to your plug-ins folder.

## Contact
If you find any bugs or issues with this plug-in, or have any suggestions, feel free to open an Issue in this repository, or visit the Endless Sky Community Discord server here: https://discord.gg/ZeuASSx and @Saugia in #plug-in chat. Additionally, feel free to leave any feedback on how limited turret arc gameplay feels with vanilla content - whether it is beneficial, net neutral, or a detriment.

<blockquote># BetterVanillaHai for Endless Sky

In short this plugin assumes news of the Hai spreads rapidly. Therefore in the late game a small percentage of humans start using their ships in ambient fleets. It therefore adds Hai vessels and many variants (like full Proton SB or Plasma/QuadBlaster Solifuge + many more) as rare additions to almost all human fleets in the late-game (more details below). This makes ambient pirate combat much more spicy and varied, with the tide of pirate battle being turned when a Hai ship from either side jumps in.

Ambient spawn rate of Hai ships should be around or below 10%. The plugin attempts to maintain NPC combat balance by adding strength evenly to opposing fleets (pirate/merchant etc), and maintain vanilla feeling fleet compositions.

It activates these changes after player completes both the missions related to the Solifuge and Pond Strider, and has also completed the main plot.

The general idea behind this change is that news of advanced squirrel aliens in close proximity to humanity would plausibly spread very rapidly and that the more prosperous/badass merchants and pirates will be therefore occasionally seen using their ships in human space.

Now if merchants/pirates start using Hai ships, then by golly gosh the military can't allow themselves to be outgunned and is forced to get on board the acorn train too. Therefore this plugin gives the Republic and FW custom variants of the SB as well as the standard Hai weapon setups. Deep/Syndicate use the Strider in the same way. Militia get nothing because they are poor.

Merchants/navy don't use the Solifuge, but pirates do because... somehow. To be honest I couldn't come up with any plausible process for pirates to get their hands on Solifuges - maybe they could buy from the De-fettered though pirates getting through Hai space seems unlikely - but whatever. It's a cool Hai ship, I didn't want to leave it out, so some Solifuge variants pop up in pirate fleets just because. Also the Proton Solifuge (used by Core pirates) is freaking badass.

This plugin doesn't add Hai outfitted human ships in a similar fashion (BetterVanillaPirates does).


Enjoy!

<blockquote># Endless Sky Conscience Plugin

This plugin is meant to allow you to complete Endless Sky story lines without doing things you have an ethical problem with. For now, it just makes it so you don't need to drop a bomb on Zenith and kill civilians.

If you'd rather grind then use a plugin, you can cap a bunch of Korath ships in Kor Ak'Mari and destroy the Sestor fleet that way.

If you take the Quarg ships anywhere other than the assigned planets and systems, they may or may not disappear.

## Installing

1. Download the plugin here: [https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases](https://github.com/mathwhiz1212/A-Coalition-At-War/releases)

2. Put the zip file in your plugins folder:

Windows: `%APPDATA%\endless-sky\plugins/`

Mac: `/Library/ApplicationSupport/endless-sky/plugins/`

Linux: `/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

3. Decompress/"Unzip" the zip file.
4. Start Endless Sky. You should be able to see "A Coalition at War" under Preferences > Plugins.
5. If you have problems, open an issue.

# Using the Plugin

Install the plugin before you get to Hevru Hai. If you're already past that mission, try landing on Hevru Hai anyway. It might still work.

Park any escort ships you don't want to lose in Hai space. Make sure you have a cloaking device on your flagship.

It's best if your flagship is better than what humans have (a Wanderer warship would do nicely), but as long as your shields can last till you run away, you'll be ok.

Destroy or capture the Sestor drones above Farpoint before you land.

After talking to Danforth, cloak and hide. Run away. If you're daring, come back and distract single Sestor ships on the edges. Cloak fast when needed.

Make sure to destroy or capture every last drone, until you get a message that starts with `Against all odds...`

## Alnilam Mission

You'll get two Quarg ships to help you with this one too. Make sure to destroy or capture every Korath drone in the system. The game is more picky about this one, so if you go to Fairpoint and don't get the next mission, go back and destroy any disabled drones.

Then return to Fairpoint. You'll then be sent to Zenith. When you get to Zenith, land immediately. Don't let the cruisers get destroyed before you land on the planet.

That's it! You've successfully avoided committing mass murder!

<blockquote># Costly Drives
I've always found it odd that hyperdrives, despite the supposed mystery of their workings, is sold super cheaply, especially when compared to a bunch of power outfits (which have basis in real life). This plugin makes drives much more expensive, while making them unplunderable to prevent easy(er) boarding. Additionally, drive sales are much more restricted.

Known Problems:
- Broken JDs don't have increased value/unplunderable: The main use of Broken JDs is for the Remnant Broken JD mission, and I didn't want to force players to have a boarding ship to do those missions.
- Missions don't give a corresponding amount of increased money. Because of the inability to modify existing missions using plugins, this is unfixable at the moment.

<blockquote>### galactic.capital.investment <br>
<br>
Implements a short mission chain that enables repeatable job board investment opportunities which result in small daily income. Available in human, quarg and hai space starting with 2 million credits cash and going up to 1 billion credits.<br>
<br>
At 1 billion credits cash a longer mission chain starts and enables a reapeatable job board investment of 1 billion credits. The chain has some breaks and finishes after a year.<br>
There is also a job to deposit and withdraw credits, but at a much lower interest rate. And the same job offers to deposit and withdraw to a family trust, which can be accessed by all your saves/pilots (but without interest).<br>
<br>
Job board investments:(if enabled)<br>
1 million = 274 credits daily (12% chance) (10% interest p.a.)<br>
5 million = 1,520 credits daily (10% chance) (11% interest p.a.)<br>
10 million = 3,287 credits daily (8% chance) (12% interest p.a.)<br>
50 million = 17,808 credits daily (6% chance) (13% interest p.a.)<br>
100 million = 38,356 credits daily (4% chance) (14% interest p.a.)<br>
1 billion = 410,958 credits daily (2% chance) (15% interest p.a.)<br>
<br>
Job board bank account, always available:<br>
Deposit and withdraw from your bank account (4% interest p.a.)<br>
Deposit and withdraw from your family trust, accessible by all your pilots<br>
Sell investments at 10% conversion rate<br>
Set up the bank account interest as a daily cash payout<br>

<br>
This plugin adds some casino space stations where you can gamble.<br>
<br>
Adds casino space stations to Ruchbah, Tarazed, Rutilicus, and Epsilon Leonis. On each station's job board you can start six luck based games (Baccarat, Blackjack, Poker, Roulette, Craps, and Sic Bo).<br>
Every won round has a chance of increasing your skill for this special game. The skill levels go up to 500 which means you have a 5% higher chance of winning a round on max level. The games have different start winning chances from 47% to 50%.  I.e. with max poker skill, you have 55% chance to win a poker round. The table limits range from 5,000 to 100,000 credits and are randomized. After around 160 played rounds you get tired and the games ends (for this day).<br>

**Author: [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

**Artwork: [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae-assets)**

**Thanks**: Zuckung

Adds the Antaren Thresher to Gossamer and neighboring systems, which consumes void fish, asteroids and since recently also Abberants. Once inhabited also Arachi space and even Antares, but out of unknown reasons went extinct there long ago.

Completely harmless.

Inspired by the Spaceshark from [Mil-taj Protectorate](https://github.com/demolish238/Mil-taj-Protectorate) by [Demolish238](https://github.com/demolish238), which was derived from the Antaren Thresher in [Cosmic Canidae](https://tearcellgames.itch.io/cosmic-canidae) by [Tearcell](https://tearcellgames.itch.io).

Can be found in Omnis under the Vyrmeids.

In the Thresher's habitat you can find crunched, i.e. derelict, Aberrants with otherwise extremely rare items to plunder.

**Changelog**

| Date | Version | Comment |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2025-08-06 | 1.2.1 | Replaced custom on-death effect with an appropriate vanilla one, such significantly reducing file size. |
| 2025-08-05 | 1.2.0 | Habitat expansion, added derelict Aberrants with rare items, tweaked stats, added image for ripping maw, becoming also the new icon. Reduced plugin size further. | 
| 2025-07-19 | 1.1.0 | Added support for Omnis. |
| 2025-07-11 | 1.0.0 | Creature relocation, and complete redesign of lore, stats and appearance. Reduced requirements regarding free storage space by 2/3. |

<blockquote>### jump.gates
<br>
<br>
Adds a ring of "jump gates" at the borders of Human space to create shortcuts inside the Human space.<br>
<br>
A month after the game starts, the player gets a spaceport info mission about a new discovered technology, that enables the building of jump gates (if your savegame is beyond that point, this info mission starts on the next planet landing). Over the next 5 months there are regularly spaceport info missions telling you things about how far the process of building these gates has come. At the end of this period all jump gates have been built and are usable.<br>
These jump gates are technically just wormholes with new sprites. The jump gate ring around human space is made of two gates in every of these systems: Naos (Deep) - Spica (Dirt Belt) - Alniyat (South) - Tarazed (South) - Sheratan (Core) - Alnitak (North) and from there back to Naos. Two gates, so you can move forward and backward on the ring.<br>

Get rewarded for playing in Endless Sky

## How it works

You will get a special mission when you go and land on New Wales,

Basically go to Earth from there and then you should enjoy a somewhat balanced salary of credits per day.

> I didn't want to make it too much or then the game get's rather boring. (Also didn't want to make it too little else you really don't gain anything)

## Don't forget I have another mod

Tired of just getting credits? Want something more?

>Overhaul of ships and systems to make flying a capital ship feel weighty...
>
>More mass on larger ships, better shield and hull regen, faster drones & intercepters, and quicker turn rates
>

<details>
<summary>:blue_book: Plugin readme</summary>
<blockquote>Attempts to adjust mass values for ships in the game Endless Sky. Where mass governs acceleration and turning and drag limits max velocity, larger ships should have more mass so they accelerate slower than small ships... 

Work in progress...

Summary of changes from 9.13:

Adjusts mass stat of ships based on the stats of the ship. I.E. Shield hitpoints,
hull hp, outfit space, etc.

Most ships gain mass small ships gain a little, large ships gain a lot. See spreadsheets/ShipMassStats
for details.

Large ships are much slower to turn and accelerate, making them feel like large ships.

Shield recharge and hull repair systems have been given a 90% boost to capablilty to help the slower
ships survive combat longer.

Added an efficiency penalty to energy consumption. spreadsheets/shieldSystems for details.
	
For example:

Human rechargers are 85% efficient, resulting in an 18.4% increase in power consumption over 
shield recharge. Vanilla is 1 point of energy gets you 1 point of shields.

Ship engines are reworked to increase the smaller engines while keeping the larger ones close to the same.

Smaller ships are now faster compared to the max speeds of the largest ships. spreadsheets/Engines.

Human/Hai engines' prices have been increased: Ion +20%, Plasma +30%, Atomic +80%. The lore speaks of
how expenisive atomic engines are, but they don't feel like it... Hopefully Ion and plasma engine fits
are more attractive to the early game.

<h1><p align=center>Endless Sky Plugin:<br />Spacefarer</p></h1>

This is a plugin for the free open source game: [Endless Sky][ES].  The theme
song for this plugin is [The Wanderer][the-wanderer].

# Gameplay Mechanics Changes

In an effort to add a unique re-playable experience to Endless Sky this plugin
aims to minimally change the vanilla experience except to place a few
constraints upon the player.

Constraints include:

- One Jump Drive
- Outfits cannot be looted
- Ships cannot be captured

# Extras provided by plugin

- Navy licenses are granted at the end of Free Worlds campaign.  So that Navy
  ships are purchasable by the player.
- Large systems core and double/triple plasma core are available after Remnant
  Cognizance missions.  They are for sale to provide additional build
  flexibility.

# Known issues

- Outfits are not plunderable but cargo on a ship can still be plundered.  This
  is a limitation in what can be accomplished in plugins.  We accept this as a
  limitation and have no plans to change it.
- If a player sells their Jump Drive they cannot get it back.  This is
  intentional.
- A player can obtain up to 3 Jump Drives simultaneously.  However, additional
  Jump Drives will be consumed to proceed with story content.  At the end, the
  player would be left with one Jump Drive.

# Development status: Beta

All critical story elements are available.  Necessary outfits are available or
plunderable when a mission calls for it.

- [x] Sheragi (JD granted for retrieving Emerald Sword)
  - [ ] Remove 2nd Jump drive granted during Sheragi campaign.
- [x] Wanderer (JD granted to give to Unfettered)
- [x] Syndicate Checkmate (JD granted to leave Pug space)
- [ ] Clean up old lootable outfits and convert them to missions.
  - [x] Free Worlds Surveillance Pod mission
  - [ ] Wanderer Control Transceiver and Reasoning Node mission
  - [ ] Free Worlds Electron Beam mission

Turn endless sky into an RPG with a ship that grows with you, crafting, and plenty of side-goodies to play with

Currently the mod is separated into two branches, pending a bugfix. The main branch is playable with no issues on continuous. The carrier pre-alpha, on the other hand, requires a bugfix PR (https://github.com/endless-sky/endless-sky/pull/7030) to be fully enjoyed, and is also unfinished.

Thank you for your interest, and I hope you enjoy!

>Provides a proper way to tribute human space after finishing the main plot without needing to save-edit (Free Worlds) or being dependent on time slots during campaign (Republic & Syndicate). Also handles independent systems by defining own polities to avoid issues with independent mission NPCs. And adds some vanilla mission chain related candy.

### Zone of Control ###

**Author: [Timeout](https://github.com/LixiChronikouOriou)**

#### Introduction ####
In vanilla, tributing human space is a bit tedious because there are no mechanisms for making peace with the factions. The only systems which don't cause issues are the Pirates' ones. To tribute the Free Worlds one has to save-edit afterwards, for tributing Republic and Syndicate one has to use the phases during the main campaign to profit from the reputation reset afterwards. Independent systems like Men cause problems with neutral mission NPCs, so one has to save-edit here, too. Also the monastery planets New Tibet cannot be tributed in vanilla, causing ugly spots on the conquest map.

#### Features ####
This post-campaign plugin solves this issue by providing a peace-making mechanism after tributing all systems of a faction, and by introducing polities for independent systems. Further, some planets will pay you tribute without a fight after the completion of a mission chain. Also New Tibet and Harmony will pay symbolic tribute of 1 credit to color the map.

Has individual dialogue boxes for each of the following situations.

| Faction | Requires | Results |
|---------|----------|----------|
| Free Worlds | Main plot complete. All FW systems except Alioth and Girtab dominated. | Recovered reputation for FW and Militia. Revoked militia license will be restored. New Tibet (Alioth) and Harmony (Girtab) will pay symbolic tribute (1 credit) to color the map properly. |
| Republic | Main plot complete. All Republican systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Republic and Deep Security. Revoked navy licenses will **not** be restored. |
| Syndicate | Main plot complete. All Syndicate systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Syndicate. |
| Free State <sup>1</sup> | Main plot complete. All Free State systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Free State and Militia. |
| Commonwealth<sup>2</sup> | Main plot complete. All Commonwealth systems dominated. | Recovered reputation for Commonwealth and Militia. |

1) A new polity for the independent system of Men. Includes Antares, if it remains neutral after the campaign.
2) A new polity if the system Tarazed remains independent after the campaign. Includes also the inhabited systems Dabih and Albireo.

| Planet | Requires | Results |
|--------|----------|---------|
| Haven | 90 days after "Ice Queen 8: done", and Haven isn't tributed currently. | Haven dominated. |
| Norn | 90 days after "Stone to Hope: Thanks: offered", and Norn isn't tributed currently. | Norn dominated. |
| Poisonwood | 30 days after "event: liberation of Poisonwood" (and done it the proper way) and "main plot completed", and Poisonwood isn't tributed currently. | Poisonwood dominated. |
| Windblain | 30 days after "Hjlod Remembers Windblain: done", and Windblain isn't tributed currently. | Windblain dominated. |

**Changelog**

| Date | Version | Comment |
|------|---------|---------|
| 2025-08-09 | 1.0.0 | Initial release. |
