description=The Cannon Friendly Weapon Pack (pun intended) is a selection of guns and lasers that aims to add more versatility to the range of weapons in Endless Sky. It attempts to blend itself into the canon where possible.

The Cannon Friendly Weapon Pack has a number of weapons and weapon additions, such as ammunition storage for most vanilla weapons, all the ammunition-consuming weapons in the CFWP, and more.
