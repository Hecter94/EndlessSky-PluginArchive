description=The goal is to add an ulterior story arc to the main game, which puts it, as of the moment this is redacted, after the wanderer storyline. The plugin will add a new galaxy to the game, with a new race: the Kaynz. They are intended to be a tier 4 alien race, capable of taking down Drak ships (with some difficulty however), a detail important to the lore.
