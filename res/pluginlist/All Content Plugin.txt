description=This mod starts you on Greenrock with a trillion (10^12) credits and access to almost every ship and outfit in the game. It is intended for testing purposes, but of course, as its description says, "it can also be used by people who want to ruin the game for themselves by getting a massive fleet without needing to work for it."
