description=In this mod you start as a member of a poor farming community on one of the Pirate worlds. Your village has just been massacred by a rogue band of pirate raiders, yet you have managed to steal one of their ships and escape. You have a chance to seek justice, wealth, or perhaps bring true political change to the Pirate worlds.
