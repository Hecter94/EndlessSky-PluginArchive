description=After the Korath have salvaged the Kor Automata building cores, not only did they begin to replicate automata ships, but they also integrated the best parts of both Kor Factions onto their Korath Raider.

(This takes place after the Co-Op Wanderer/Korath mission and adds a Korath Pillager variant to their raiding fleets.) ("korath raid")

So you might no longer be able to equip captured Kor Automata with jump drives but at least you will be able to get something even better. Has a large amount of crew required to balance its awesomeness

Basically merges the Good of both Mereti and Sestor Ships into one

NOTE: Also makes the Remnant Missions a tad harder if done after the wanderer storyline
