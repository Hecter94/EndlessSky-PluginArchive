description=This plugin modifies the Sol system adding every planet, large moon (over 20!) and two dwarf planets (Ceres and Pluto with its moon, Charon), each with unique sprites modified from NASA pictures taken during various missions. Everything in Sol has also been resized to a much bigger and realistic size, including the Sun itself.
