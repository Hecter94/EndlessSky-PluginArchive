description=This plugin adds a set of Gyroscopes: They can store an amount of energy, and can produce turning force, despite not taking any engine space. But, they are dense, and constantly consume energy.

In addition, there are Flywheel Batteries: similar to the gyroscopes, except that they are dedicated batteries with no turn rate; much more powerful than a similarly sized battery, but with the mentioned downsides.
