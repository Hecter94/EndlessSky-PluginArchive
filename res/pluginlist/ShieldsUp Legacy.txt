description=Shields Up Legacy is a small combination of two of the oldest mods that were in the original Shields Up pack: That Someone and Tufton's plugins.
That Someone brings with it a whole new faction of Hai who have their own stories and outlooks on the history of the Hai, and a strange new Pug factions that partakes in a perpetual war.
Tufton adds cool new weapons and an amazing heavy fighter called the Tactical Assault Fighter.
