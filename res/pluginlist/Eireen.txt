description=In this plugin, you establish some relation to Eireen, one of the chief engineers for cargo affairs at Southbound Shipyards on Zug.
You need to meet a certain minimum fleet / game progress to meet her (as of now: either 1200 cargo space, or 50M networth, or a third (lower) condition).
But your first contact - which is so far the main conversation of this plugin (more to follow) - heavily depends on or progress in the games campaigns.
