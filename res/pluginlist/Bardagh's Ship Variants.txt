description=A plugin which adds variants of human ships to select shipyards. No stat changes, just loadouts. Right now it's mostly bare-bones versions so you don't have to pay for a bunch of outfits you're just going to sell - instead you get a (very) cheap engine & power system, a hyperdrive (or scram drive for the really big ships), & luxury accommodations when they're part of the stock loadout.
