description=In short this plugin assumes news of the Hai spreads rapidly. Therefore in the late game a small percentage of humans start using their ships in ambient fleets. It therefore adds Hai vessels and many variants (like full Proton SB or Plasma/QuadBlaster Solifuge + many more) as rare additions to almost all human fleets in the late-game (more details below). This makes ambient pirate combat much more spicy and varied, with the tide of pirate battle being turned when a Hai ship from either side jumps in.
