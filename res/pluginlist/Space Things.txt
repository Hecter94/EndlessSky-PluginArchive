description=The Space things mod implements many space themed ships, planets, etc. into the game. Of course some continuity errors 
will arise, mostly because i have to change the story to fit into the Endless Sky world. More updates will come, 
however i can't guarantee consistanty in updates. I hope you enjoy! (There might be some easter eggs in the Pirate systems,
just be patient and you'll see. :)
