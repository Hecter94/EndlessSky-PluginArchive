description=This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

Current status

Intro and part 2/4 finished: Runs up almost to the point of the Free Worlds choice to side with the defector or Syndicate

- Plus the main side-plot for part I, and some side jobs

I've written the story outline for the rest, up to the end of the civil war, but not written it into the game yet: that's To Be Continued.
