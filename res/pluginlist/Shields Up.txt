description=Say hello to the one and only Shields Up plugin! This iteration of Shields Up is the love-child of quite a few people, as it was worked on by Direstorm and Friendly Neighbor, has a few cool ships from Mdsmestad, was just recently merged with the Alphean's Expansion plugin, and is currently under the care of Derpy Horse.
Enjoy playing with dozens of new systems, outfits, and ships across the Milky Way galaxy (and beyond...?) as you encounter strange new alien races never before seen by humanity.
