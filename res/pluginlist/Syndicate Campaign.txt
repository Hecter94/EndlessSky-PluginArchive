description=This is an alternate start for Endless Sky, with a full storyline running parallel to the Free Worlds story.

Current status

Main story and most side-things, complete. This will take you up to the end of the civil war, all completed and ready to continue the game as if you'd completed the main-game story.

Remaining: logs on all the events; a few more epilogue conversations; and various hopefully-minor issues, both discovered and undiscovered.
