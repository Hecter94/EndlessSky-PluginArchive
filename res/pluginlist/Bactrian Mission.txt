description=This plugin was built to provide some satisfaction to acquiring the mighty Bactrian. Hopefully the short mission sequence will also be enjoyable.
There is some non-linearity to the story so depending on your choices two of three large ships (i.e. flagships) can be made available for purchase.
Two large ships, one bounty mission and one transport mission were added.
