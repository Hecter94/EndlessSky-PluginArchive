description=An overhaul and re-publication of Loyse's More Ships Plugin. This jewel had to be polished regarding the stats, as it was updated last in May 2020. Luckily Loyse gave permission, and the idea to call the shipyard Louise. Lore-wise the Louise Conglomerate is one of the Syndicate's megacorps, and its shipyards focus on ships for the harsh pirate-infested systems and therefore are centered around robustness and agility, at that keeping a remarkable sense for beautiful design. Adds 6 ships and 2 weapons.
