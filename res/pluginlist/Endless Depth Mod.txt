description=Endless Depth is a assortion of my random ideas that I thought might give the game a bit more depth. Hence the name. Rather than focusing on outfits, ships, and other things to blow up, I'm trying to get a little more creative, with things such as planetary flight areas, pirate gangs, and a few other small details I added.
