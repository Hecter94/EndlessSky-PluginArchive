description=This plugin gives you some alternatives for the starting character. The choices are:

  the standard starting character from the official version of Endless Sky.
  an adventurer with a good combat rating.
  an inexperienced youth with a trust fund.
  a merchant with a temporarily mislaid ship.

For the last two of these, you'll have to complete a simple mission.
