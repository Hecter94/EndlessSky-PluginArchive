# Introduction

A comprehensive library of %allplugins% ancient and new plugins for the open-source game Endless Sky.

---

# Download Information

All plugins can be downloaded directly as zip files from the [releases](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/releases/tag/Latest) page.

## Downloading Alternative

Third-party tools such as [https://download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/) can download a single folder/plugin. Paste the folder URL into that tool and you will be given a .zip file for that folder.

For example, for the "50 cal" plugin, enter: [https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/50%20cal](https://github.com/Hecter94/EndlessSky-PluginArchive/tree/main/Working/50%20cal)

Github, by default, only allows the entire library to be downloaded as a single .zip. GitHub may have issues downloading large file sizes; a possible workaround is using GitHub Desktop or Git Bash to clone the repository.

## Notes

- "Working" directory – plugins updated to work with the continous build of Endless Sky
- "Originals" directory – archived copies of original plugins
- "Nonfunctional" directory – plugins that will not function without updates

## Known Plugin Issues

<details>

### A Galaxy Far Far Away, Businessman Mod, Endless Depth, Normandy

The title screen is missing/corrupted. These plugins override the vanilla title screen; using one or more of these can cause issues with it looking corrupted or "missing." Recommend to use one of these at a time, OR delete title.png from \images to restore the vanilla title screen.

### Civil War, Edge of Endless, Jump to Lightspeed, and Star Wars

All edit the vanilla interface; this can also cause issues and can only be fixed by editing/removing the interfaces.txt file in the plugin.

### A Wonderful Worldship

Random sprites replaced by worldships, intended Behavior of "A Wonderful Worldship plugin."

### Bare Ships

Clears all ships from shipyards, meaning only bare versions of ships will be available; any plugins adding other ships not to custom shipyards will likely be incompatible.

### Elite Sky

It creates an Interceptor "bay type," making any interceptor escort randomly jump around.

### Final Frontier

It sets every government to swizzle to 0 and has an image named raider that conflicts with vanilla Korath raider.

### Star Wars

Includes a copy of vanilla data files and will likely conflict with any missions added/changed since it was created. Specifically known to conflict with changes to the Remnant storyline.

Includes an image named Fury which conflicts with vanilla Fury.

### Recovery Ships

NPC Ships being unable to assist with fuel or repairs. The culprit: Likely an old version of Recovery Ship, updated 2/8/2022. Please let me know if you still see the issue.

Escorts from missions not spawning correctly Culprit: use the “safe” variant of this plugin to fix this behavior, “safe” version ships can only carry "Fighter" from vanilla and "Heavy Fighter" and "Gunship."

### The Station of Dr. Rousseau

"Bounty" Arfecta is spawned directly outside starting location. The culprit: Mission: "Puzzle 3". No location is defined, so Arfecta is spawned on the first "landing."

The "Hunt Dread Pirate Roberts" mission offers everywhere due to a lack of a source filter.

### Edge of Endless

Overrides Luxury Accommodations and gives it much higher space, bunks, and crew requirements, which might make some ships with it appear to have negative space and bunks.

Ship "Colossus" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Adamas

### Adamas

Ship "Colossus" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Edge of Endless

### ES-Restock

Gatling gun texture has empty space at 200px tall, resulting in the outfit display being 10px lower than others.

### Akasha Chronicles

Ship "Seraphim" conflicts with a ship of the same name from AES Irm.

### AES Irm*

Ship "Seraphim" conflicts with a ship of the same name from the Akasha Chronicles.

### Mata

Ship "Spectre" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Alterra.

### Alterra

Ship "Spectre" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Mata.

Ship "Gladius" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Eternals

### Eternals

Ship "Gladius" conflicts with a ship of the same name from Alterra

### Cobbled Ships

Ship "Mammoth" conflicts with a ship of the same name in vanilla version 0.9.15 and later.

# Contribution

## Regarding Plugin Information

Some plugins are still missing important information, such as the author, description or current status. If you would like to help add this info, please update these by posting in the discussions area or making a Pull Request changing the files in `/res/pluginlist/`.

## Add your plugin

Do you want your plugin here? Fork this repository, upload your plugin, and make a Pull Request. Besides that, you can post it in the discussion area.

For Pull Requests, create a file with the plugin information in `/res/pluginlist/` and your plugin at `Working/`, so this README.md can get auto-generated by a script. Check the other files there to see the formatting.

If you provide a `directlink=` in the plugin file at `res/pluginlist/`, then there is no need to upload your plugin to the `Working` directory; your plugin will be uploaded automatically on the next daily check for updates. So instead of uploading a folder with a git client, you can upload a single text file with the web Interface.

## Automatic Updating

The files in `res/pluginlist/` used to generate this README.md have a line `directlink=`, where you can put a URL to your zipped plugin. The line should look like this: `directlink=https://github.com/userxyz/esplugins/releases/download/Latest/myplugin.zip` or any other directly accessible webspace.

This repository does an automated check for your direct link once a day at 23:30am UTC, and if your plugin there is newer than the one hosted here, it updates it and puts it in the news box. Please read the naming convention paragraph to prevent errors.

If you have a single plugin GitHub repo (with the data folder in the root), you can use the auto-generated zip file (green button) as a direct update link. You can fork the official plugin template repository at [https://github.com/endless-sky/plugin-template](https://github.com/endless-sky/plugin-template).

With this feature, we hope to create a centralized overview for active plugin development.

## Plugin Naming Convention

Although a lot of checking and error handling got implemented in the scripts, there might be some bugs. To be safe, try to avoid special characters in your plugin name.

We now have different paths and files addressed to the same plugin. The plugin folder is `Working/YourPlugin/`, and the information file is at `res/pluginlist/YourPlugin.txt`.<br>
To keep these files related, you must give them the same name.
